It should be noted that step 1 in the transformed_solution <After 30 days, there will be enough food left to sustain 300 people for 90 days – 30 days = 60 days.> should be the same as the step 1 in the original_solution <After 30 days, there will be enough food left to sustain 300 people for 90 days – 30 days = 60 days.> and calculates its result 60 correctly. The change in value from 60 to 70 affects only step 4 without affecting the correct calculation steps. All other steps that reference the number of days, people, or the fraction still reference these numbers correctly.

        "corrected_answer": "40.0",
        "corrected_explanation": "The error in the original solution is in the calculation of how long the remaining food will last the smaller group of 200 people. The original solution incorrectly applied the ratio of people to the duration of food, which is not correct. The correct approach is to take the amount of food left and divide it by the increased consumption rate due to the reduced number of people. Since 200 people consume 2/3 of what 300 people consume, the food will last 3/2 or 1.5 times as long, not 2/3 times as long as incorrectly calculated in the original solution."
