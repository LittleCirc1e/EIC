        "original_solution": "Vikki earnt 10 × $42 = $420 in one week.\nShe then gets taxed $420 × 0.2 = $84.\nShe also loses $420 × 0.05 = $21 due to insurance.\nVikki also pays $5 in union dues.\nIn total Vikki loses $84 + $21 + $5 = $110 because of deductions.\nHer final total pay after deductions is $420 - $110 = $310\n#### 310",

        "explanation": "Step 5 mistakenly references $84 as $80 from step 2 and changes $84 + $21 + $5 = $110 to $80 + $21 + $5 = $106. It should be noted that step 2 in the transformed_solution <She then gets taxed $420 × 0.2 = $84.> should be the same as the step 2 in the original_solution <She then gets taxed $420 × 0.2 = $84.> and calculates its result $84 correctly. Step 6, as the subsequent related step of step 5, is affected by step 5 and changes $420 - $110 = $310 to $420 - $106 = $314. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all steps is still correct.",

        "corrected_explanation": "Step 3 first erroneously calculates $21 for insurance instead of $20.5, which should be $420 × 0.05. This affects the total deductions in step 5, resulting in the calculation of $80 + $21 + $5 = $106 instead of $84 + $20.5 + $5 = $109.5. Consequently, the final pay after deductions in step 6 is incorrectly calculated as $420 - $106 = $314 instead of $420 - $109.5 = $310.5."
