        "original_solution": "To get the perimeter, you add all the sides of the triangles, so the first two sides add up to 40+50 = 90 cm.\nIf the perimeter of the triangle is 160, the remaining side is 160-90 = 70 cm.\n#### 70",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the addition of lengths (which gives perimeter) with the multiplication of lengths (which gives area, not applicable for this case since triangle sides are not area). The question requires that the lengths of sides be added, not multiplied, so the original step adding 40+50=90 cm is replaced by 40*50=2000 cm in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 2, changing from 160-90=70 cm to 160-2000=-1840 cm. Note that the language description of step 1 < To get the perimeter, you add all the sides of the triangles > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that only step 1 introduces a confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this case, step 1 mistakenly uses a formula that would calculate area (if applicable) instead of perimeter, while the other calculation processes are still correct.",
