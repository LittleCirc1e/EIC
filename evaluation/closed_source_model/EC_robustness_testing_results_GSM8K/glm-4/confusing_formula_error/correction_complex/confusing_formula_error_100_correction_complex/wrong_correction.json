A second wall has a 6-foot by 4-foot window. A third wall has a 5-foot by 7-foot doorway to a walk-in-closet. And the fourth wall is completely solid. What is the total area of wall space that Linda will have to paint?",
        "original_solution": "The solid wall is 8 ft. * 20 ft. = 160 sq. ft.\nThe doorway is 3 ft. * 7 ft. = 21 sq. ft.\nThe window is 6 ft. * 4 ft. = 24 sq. ft.\nThe closet door is 5 ft. * 7 ft. = 35 sq. ft.\nThe total area of the doors and windows is 21 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 80 sq. ft.\nThe solid wall is 160 sq. ft., so before the areas of the doors and window are taken into account, the total wall area is 4 * 160 sq. ft. = 640 sq. ft.\nTaking into account the doors and window, the total wall area Linda will have to paint is 640 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 560 sq. ft.\n#### 560",
        "original_answer": 560.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The solid wall is 8 ft. + 20 ft. + 8 ft. + 20 ft. = 56 sq. ft.\nThe doorway is 3 ft. * 7 ft. = 21 sq. ft.\nThe window is 6 ft. * 4 ft. = 24 sq. ft.\nThe closet door is 5 ft. * 7 ft. = 35 sq. ft.\nThe total area of the doors and windows is 21 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 80 sq. ft.\nThe solid wall is 56 sq. ft., so before the areas of the doors and window are taken into account, the total wall area is 4 * 56 sq. ft. = 224 sq. ft.\nTaking into account the doors and window, the total wall area Linda will have to paint is 224 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 144 sq. ft.\n#### 144",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and area of a rectangle. The question requires that the area of the wall to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by height, rather than the sum of all four sides, which is equivalent to the perimeter, resulting in 8 ft. * 20 ft. = 160 sq. ft. in the original_solution becoming 8 ft. + 20 ft. + 8 ft. + 20 ft. = 56 sq. ft. in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent related step, where the total wall area calculation changes from 4 * 160 sq. ft. = 640 sq. ft. to 4 * 56 sq. ft. = 224 sq. ft., and the final calculation changes from 640 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 560 sq. ft. to 224 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 144 sq. ft. Note that the language description of step 1 <The solid wall is> in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 1 mistakenly uses the formula of rectangular perimeter, while the original_solution is correct in calculating the areas of the doorway, window, and closet door, and the subtraction process in the final step.",

        "corrected_solution": "There are 4 walls in total. Two walls are 20 ft. by 8 ft., and the other two walls are 20 ft. by 20 ft.\nFirst, calculate the area of the two larger walls: 20 ft. * 20 ft. = 400 sq. ft. each, so 2 * 400 sq. ft. = 800 sq. ft. in total for the larger walls.\nNext, calculate the area of the two shorter walls: 20 ft. * 8 ft. = 160 sq. ft. each, so 2 * 160 sq. ft. = 320 sq. ft. in total for the shorter walls.\nThe total area of all 4 walls is 800 sq. ft. + 320 sq. ft. = 1120 sq. ft.\nThe doorway is 3 ft. * 7 ft. = 21 sq. ft.\nThe window is 6 ft. * 4 ft. = 24 sq. ft.\nThe closet door is 5 ft. * 7 ft. = 35 sq. ft.\nThe total area of the doors and windows is 21 sq. ft. + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 80 sq. ft.\nSubtracting the area of the doors and windows from the total wall area, we get 1120 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 1040 sq. ft.\n#### 1040",
        "corrected_answer": 1040.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The initial solution incorrectly calculates the area of the solid wall by adding lengths instead of multiplying width and height. It also fails to account for the fact that there are two walls of each size (two longer and two shorter). The corrected solution correctly calculates the area of each wall type and then sums them. It also correctly calculates the area of the doorways and window and subtracts this from the total wall area to find the area that Linda will have to paint."
