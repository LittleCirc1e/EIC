In the original_solution, step 4 references the result of 33 from the previous step 3, and the following steps reference the result of step 4. Therefore, after deleting step 4, the remaining calculations must be modified to relate directly to the outcome of step 3. Step 4 changes from 3D = 33 to D = 38 / 3, as this step should now deal with the equation in its unresolved form since the calculation to isolate D has been removed. Subsequently, in the calculation for determining the upstairs vacuuming time in step 5, the reference to 11 minutes for D should change to use the expression 38 / 3 directly, so it goes from (2 * 11) to (2 * (38 / 3)). This step also changes the language description based on the new calculation for D. The new step computes the total time as 29 minutes.

        "explanation": "This example removes intermediate step 3 about Phil collecting 1 coin every third month. This step references the result 4 from the calculation 12/3. Step 4 in the original_solution references the result from this deleted step 3. Therefore, after deleting step 3, step 4 should not include the 4 coins from step 3. The formula changes from 100+36+4 coins to 100+36 coins, which results in 136 coins before the loss. Subsequent steps 5 and 6 are about losing a quarter of the coins and hence will be modified based on the new total before the loss (136 instead of 140). So, step 5 changes from 140/4=35 coins to 136/4=34 coins, and step 6 changes from 140-35=105 coins to 136-34=102 coins. Step 2 in the transformed_solution references the incorrect total number of coins after the deletion of step 3, serving as the first step referencing an incorrect number. The wrong_step is 2 as this is where the error first appears.",

        "corrected_answer": 106.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The first erroneous step is in the calculation after the third year. The solution completely omits the addition of coins collected in the third year, where Phil collected 1 coin every third month. This should be 12/3=4 coins added that year. The corrected step should include the additional 4 coins to the total before he lost a quarter of his coins, making the total 136+4=140 coins. Then, losing a quarter of 140 coins would mean he lost 140/4=35 coins, leaving him with 140-35=105 coins. However, since we are only correcting one step, we'll add the 4 coins after the loss, resulting in 102+4=106 coins remaining."

        "question": "A man decides to try and do everything off his bucket list while he is still young and fit enough to finish it all. One of his goals was to climb the seven summits. He realizes first he has to get in shape to do it and it takes him 2 years of working out to get healthy enough to take up mountain climbing. He then spends twice that long learning how to be a technically proficient mountain climber. After that he starts with the simplest mountain on the list and climbs them all. He spends 5 months climbing each mountain. After that he takes 13 months learning to dive and dives through all the caves he wants in 2 years. How much time did it take to get through all these goals?",
        "original_solution": "He spent 2*2=4 years learning to climb\nHe spends 5*7=35 months climbing all 7 mountains\nAfter a 13 month break, he starts diving so that is 35+13=48 months\nThat means it is 48/12=4 years\nSo in total it all took 2+4+4+2=12 years\n#### 12",

        "explanation": "In this example, the first step that calculates the time spent learning to climb is removed. Step 4 of the original_solution, which references the result '4 years' from the deleted Step 1, gets modified. The time spent preparing and learning to dive (2 years + 13 months) remains unaltered. However, since step 1 was removed, the total years cannot include the 4 years from the removed step. The new calculation in the transformed_solution should be the initial 2 years of working out, plus 4 years of mountaineering (calculated from the 48 months), plus 2 years of diving education, plus 2 years of actual diving, equaling 10 years in total. As per guidance given, the transformed solution has one less step compared to the original solution, and the wrong_step is the first one after the deletion that makes reference to the previous calculation ('2+4+4+2=12 years' changes to '2+4+2+2=10 years'), which is transformed step 4.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The first error in the solution is in step 5 where it incorrectly adds up the time taken for each goal. It fails to convert the time spent in months to years correctly. The correct calculation should be 2 years (getting healthy) + 4 years (learning to climb) + 35 months (climbing) + 13 months (learning to dive) + 2 years (diving) which is 24 + 48 + 35 + 13 + 24 months. This totals to 134 months. When converted to years, it is 134/12=11 years, not 10 years as previously calculated."
