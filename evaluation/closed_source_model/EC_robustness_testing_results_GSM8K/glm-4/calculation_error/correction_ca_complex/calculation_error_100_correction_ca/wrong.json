        "original_solution": "Jaco will spend a total of $9 x 8 = $72 for his 8 friends' gifts.\nHe will be left with $100 - $72 = $28 for his mother and father's gift.\nSo, Jaco's budget for each of his mother and father's gift is $28/2 = $14.\n#### 14",

        "explanation": "In this case, the wrong calculation was introduced in step 2, where the budget remaining for his mother and father's gift was incorrectly calculated as $30 instead of $28. This error subsequently led to an incorrect division of the remaining budget in half, resulting in $15 per gift for his mother and father instead of the correct $14. The first step remained unchanged, as it did not depend on step 2, and the last step only inherited the wrong amount from the erroneous step 2.",
