        "question": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2% today. The Dow ended the day at 8,722. What was the Dow in the morning before the markets opened?",
        "original_solution": "Today the Dow was down 8722 / 98*2 = 178.\nSo it started at 8722 + 178 = 8900.\n#### 8900",
        "original_answer": 8900.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Today the Dow was down 8722 / 98*2 = 188.\nSo it started at 8722 + 188 = 8910.\n#### 8910",

        "explanation": "The transformed_solution shows an intentional wrong calculation of the first step: '8722 / 98*2 = 188' instead of the correct '8722 / 98*2 = 178'. The mistake in the first step carries over to the second step '8722 + 188 = 8910' to maintain the inherited error. The subsequent step is affected by using the erroneous result of 188; however, this step is still calculated correctly based on the new wrong input. The original step is '8722 + 178 = 8900', and the transformed solution alters the outcome to '8722 + 188 = 8910'. The transformed answer is therefore 8910, which is different from the original answer of 8900. This simulates a single miscalculation without changing any operands or operators in the formula.",

        "corrected_answer": 8896.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "Step 1 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, incorrectly using 98 instead of 100 to calculate the percentage decrease. The correct calculation should be 8722 / 100*2 = 174, not 8722 / 98*2 = 188. This leads to an incorrect starting value of 8722 + 188 = 8910 instead of the correct starting value of 8722 + 174 = 8896."

        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates the total spent on everything but cookies as $11 instead of $13 in step 4, which affects the subsequent calculation of the money spent on cookies in step 5. The modified formula in step 5 becomes 25 - 11 = 14 instead of 25 - 13 = 12. Step 6 and step 7 remain unaffected as they do not rely on the result of step 4 or step 5. As a result, the error is confined to step 4's calculation and its immediate consequence on step 5, leaving all other steps and their calculations as correct. In step 7, the number of boxes of cookies is inaccurately calculated based on the mistaken $14 value, yielding 14 / 6 = 2.33 boxes of cookies.",
