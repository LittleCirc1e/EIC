        "question": "Nancy, the librarian, is shelving books from the cart. She shelved 12 history books, 8 romance books, and 4 poetry books from the top section of the cart. Half the books on the bottom section of the cart were mystery books, which she quickly put back into place. Then, she shelved the remaining books from the bottom of the cart, including 5 Western novels and 6 biographies. How many books did she have on the book cart when she started?",
        "original_solution": "Half of the books on the bottom section of the cart are mystery books, which means they are the same as the number of Western novels and biographies put together. So there are 5 + 6 = 11 mystery novels.\nAdd them all together, and there are 12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 11 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies = 46 books total\n#### 46",
        "original_answer": 46.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Half of the books on the bottom section of the cart are mystery books, which means they are the same number as the sum of Western novels, biographies, and an additional 3 literature textbooks that Nancy forgot to count initially. So there are 5 Western novels + 6 biographies + 3 literature textbooks = 14 books that are not mystery novels.\nThe mystery books are the same amount, so there are also 14 mystery novels.\nTo find the total, we sum up all the categories: 12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 14 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies + 3 literature = 52 books total\n#### 52",

        "explanation": "The modified step 1 adds information that is not mentioned in the original question statement <and an additional 3 literature textbooks that Nancy forgot to count initially>, resulting in the transformation of the step from \"5 + 6 = 11 mystery novels\" in the original_solution to \"5 Western novels + 6 biographies + 3 literature textbooks = 14 books that are not mystery novels\" in the transformed_solution. This affects the following summation step, changing the total from \"12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 11 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies = 46 books\" to \"12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 14 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies + 3 literature = 52 books\".
