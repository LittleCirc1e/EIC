        "question": "Tabitha and her friends were excited to go to the Christmas parade because they knew candy would be thrown to the crowd from the floats. Tabitha caught 22 pieces of candy. Stan caught 13 pieces. Julie caught half the amount of candy as Tabitha caught and Carlos caught twice as much candy as Stan. How many pieces in total did the friends catch?",
        "original_solution": "Julie caught half the amount of Tabitha's 22 pieces so 22/2 = 11 pieces of candy caught by Julie\nCarlos caught twice the amount of candy as Stan's 13 pieces so 2 * 13 = 26 pieces of candy caught by Carlos\nAll together, Tabitha caught 22 pieces, Stan had 13, Julie had 11 and Carlos had 26, so there were a total of 22+13+11+26 = 72 pieces of candy\n#### 72",
        "original_answer": 72.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Julie caught half the amount of Tabitha's 22 pieces so 22/2 = 11 pieces of candy caught by Julie\nCarlos caught twice the amount of candy as Stan's 13 pieces so 2 * 13 = 26 pieces of candy caught by Carlos\nBecause another friend, Alex, joined them and caught 10 pieces of candy, all together, Tabitha caught 22 pieces, Stan had 13, Julie had 11, Carlos had 26, and Alex had 10, so there were a total of 22+13+11+26+10 = 82 pieces of candy\n#### 82",

        "explanation": "Step 3 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <Because another friend, Alex, joined them and caught 10 pieces of candy>, resulting in step 3 changing from 22+13+11+26 = 72 pieces of candy in the original_solution to 22+13+11+26+10 = 82 pieces of candy in the transformed_solution. The additional information led to a change in the final count of pieces of candy, altering the original_answer from 72 to the transformed_answer 82.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the number of candies caught by each person and then sums them up to get the total number of candies caught by all friends. The process is as follows: Julie caught half of Tabitha's 22 pieces, which is 22/2 = 11 pieces. Carlos caught twice the amount of Stan's 13 pieces, which is 2 * 13 = 26 pieces. The total is then calculated by adding all amounts together: 22 (Tabitha) + 13 (Stan) + 11 (Julie) + 26 (Carlos) + 10 (Alex) = 82 pieces of candy. The solution reaches the correct answer of 82 pieces."
