        "question": "One dandelion seed floated onto Mrs. Middleton's lawn, landed on good soil, and began to grow. After one month, the dandelion plant had grown to full size and developed a flower. At the end of the second month, the flower turned to 50 fluffy, white seeds, which blew onto the lawn. Only half of these seeds landed onto good soil, germinated, and began to grow, just as the first seed had done. If each of these new seedling plants produces the same number of seeds in the same amount of time as the original plant, what is the total number of seeds that these newest plants will produce in two months' time?",
        "original_solution": "Half of the 50 seeds, or 50/2=25 seeds germinated and grew.\nIf each of the 25 plants produces 50 seeds, then a total of 25*50=1250 seeds would be produced.\n#### 1,250",
        "original_answer": 1250.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Half of the 50 seeds, or 48/2=24 seeds germinated and grew.\nIf each of the 24 plants produces 50 seeds, then a total of 24*50=1200 seeds would be produced.\n#### 1,200",

        "explanation": "Step 1 mistakenly references 50 in the question as 48, and calculates 48/2=24 instead of 50/2=25. The error affects step 2, with the calculation changing from 25*50=1,250 to 24*50=1,200. Please note that only one error is considered, so while step 2 is affected by the result of the erroneous step 1, it still correctly references the number 50 for the amount of seeds each plant produces.",

        "corrected_answer": "1,250",
        "corrected_explanation": "The first step incorrectly divided 48 by 2 instead of the correct number of seeds, which is 50. This led to an incorrect number of plants and subsequently an incorrect total number of seeds produced."

        "original_solution": "If two pizzas will be delivered at two of the stops, the total number of stops will be 12-2=10 stops.\nIf there are 10 stops in 40 minutes, then the delivery person needs to average 40/10=4 minutes per stop.\n#### 4",

        "corrected_answer": "6.67",
        "corrected_explanation": "The initial calculation incorrectly assumed that delivering two pizzas at two stops reduces the total number of stops by 4. However, each of these stops still counts as one stop. Therefore, there are 12 pizzas to be delivered in 6 stops, not 8. The corrected average time per stop is the total time available (40 minutes) divided by the number of stops (6)."
