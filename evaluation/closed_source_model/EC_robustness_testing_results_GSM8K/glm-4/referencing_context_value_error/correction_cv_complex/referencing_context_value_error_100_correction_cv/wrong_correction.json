        "question": "The pizza delivery person has 12 pizzas to deliver. If two of the stops are for orders of two pizzas and the rest are for single pizzas, how many minutes per stop does the delivery person need to average to deliver all of the pizzas in 40 minutes?",
        "original_solution": "If two pizzas will be delivered at two of the stops, the total number of stops will be 12-2=10 stops.\nIf there are 10 stops in 40 minutes, then the delivery person needs to average 40/10=4 minutes per stop.\n#### 4",
        "original_answer": 4.0,
        "transformed_solution": "If two pizzas will be delivered at two of the stops, the total number of stops will be 12-4=8 stops.\nIf there are 8 stops in 40 minutes, then the delivery person needs to average 40/8=5 minutes per stop.\n#### 5",

        "explanation": "Step 1 references 2 in the question as 4 wrongly, and calculates 12-4=8 instead of 12-2=10. Its subsequent related step will be affected, calculating 40/8=5 instead of 40/10=4 in step 2. Please note that you should only consider one error, so step 2 still references 40 in the question correctly.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "If two pizzas will be delivered at two of the stops, the total number of stops will be 12/2=6 stops.\nIf there are 6 stops in 40 minutes, then the delivery person needs to average 40/6=6.67 minutes per stop.\n#### 6.67",
        "corrected_answer": 6.67,
        "corrected_explanation": "Step 1 first makes an error in the calculation of the total number of stops. It incorrectly subtracts 4 from 12, which is based on the misunderstanding that each of the two stops for two pizzas should be subtracted as two stops. The correct approach should be dividing the total number of pizzas by the number of pizzas per stop, which is 2 for the special stops and 1 for the rest. This results in 12/2=6 stops. The error affects step 2 and step 3 that reference the number of stops. Step 2 incorrectly calculates 40/8=5 instead of 40/6=6.67, and step 3 provides the incorrect final answer of 5 minutes per stop instead of the correct 6.67 minutes per stop."
