        "corrected_answer": 8.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly calculates the number of ripe peaches left after the third day by not accounting for the peaches that ripen on the third day. It also incorrectly calculates the final number of ripe peaches by not adding the two peaches that ripen on the fifth day.
