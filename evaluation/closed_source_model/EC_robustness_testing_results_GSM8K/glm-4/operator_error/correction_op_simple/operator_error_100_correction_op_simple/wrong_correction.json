        "original_solution": "There were 20 x 0.20 = 4 sacks of rice increase after the first harvest.\nSo the total sack of rice that you can get on the next harvest 20 + 4 = 24.\nTherefore the total number of sacks of rice you will get on the first and second harvest is 20 + 24 = 44.\n#### 44",

        "explanation": "This example changes the multiplication in step 1 to division by switching * to /, changing 20 x 0.20 = 4 to 20 / 0.20 = 100. This incorrectly increases the amount of rice increase after the first harvest. Consequently, all subsequent steps are affected by this change: step 2 changes from 20 + 4 = 24 to 20 + 100 = 120, and step 3 changes the total sacks of rice from 20 + 24 = 44 to 20 + 120 = 140.

        "corrected_answer": "72.8",
        "corrected_explanation": "The error in the original solution is an operator error in the calculation of the increase after the first harvest. The increase should be calculated as 20 sacks * 0.20, not by dividing 20 by 0.20. This leads to incorrect calculations for the total number of sacks in both the first and second harvests."
