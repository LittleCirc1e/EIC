        "question": "Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's hair. Emily’s hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair. If Logan hair is 20 inches, how many inches is Kate’s hair?",
        "original_solution": "Emily’s hair is 20-6 = 14 inches long.\nKate's hair 14/2= 7 inches long.\n#### 7",
        "original_answer": 7.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Emily’s hair is 20+6 = 26 inches long.\nKate's hair 26/2= 13 inches long.\n#### 13",

        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example changes the subtraction in the original solution step 1 to addition, turning '20-6 = 14 inches' into '20+6 = 26 inches'. Subsequently, step 2, which calculates the length of Kate's hair based on the length of Emily's hair, now uses the incorrect figure from step 1 but does the calculation correctly. Thus, '14/2= 7 inches' is transformed into '26/2= 13 inches'. The transformed answer is therefore different from the original answer due to the introduced operator error in step 1.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "corrected_solution": "none",
        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the length of Emily's hair as 26 inches by adding 6 inches to Logan's hair length of 20 inches. Then it correctly divides this length by 2 to find that Kate's hair is 13 inches long, following the information that Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's. The final answer of 13 inches is correct."

        "question": "Emily has 4 kids named Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. If James is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey, how old is Jackson?",
        "original_solution": "James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old\nAmy is 2 years younger than Corey so is 11 - 2 = 9 years old\nAmy is also 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old\n#### 4",
        "original_answer": 4.0,
        "transformed_solution": "James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 - 1 = 9 years old\nAmy is 2 years younger than Corey so is 9 - 2 = 7 years old\nAmy is also 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 7 - 5 = 2 years old\n#### 2",

        "explanation": "This example changes the addition in step 1 to subtraction, turning '10 + 1 = 11' into '10 - 1 = 9'. This error affects subsequent related steps 2 and 3. In step 2, the equation is now '9 - 2 = 7' resulting from the changed age of Corey, and in step 3, the equation becomes '7 - 5 = 2' due to Amy being 5 years older than Jackson, which has now been calculated based on the incorrect age of Amy. It should be noted that other than the erroneous operator change in step 1, the calculations in all other steps correctly follow through from the error.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly identifies the relationships between the ages of the children and performs the correct arithmetic operations to find Jackson's age. James is correctly determined to be 10 and Corey is correctly determined to be 1 year older, making Corey 11. Amy is then correctly determined to be 2 years younger, making Amy 9. Finally, Jackson is correctly determined to be 5 years younger than Amy, making Jackson 4 years old. However, the final answer given is incorrect; it should be 4, not 2."
