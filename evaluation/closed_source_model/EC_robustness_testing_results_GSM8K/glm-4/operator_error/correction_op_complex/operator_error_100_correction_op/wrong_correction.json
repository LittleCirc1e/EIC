        "question": "Max works for a delivery company as a courier. During one working day, he can deliver a maximum of 35 packages. One week, Max delivered the maximum number of packages, only twice. On two other days, Max unloaded a total of 50 packages, and on one day he unloaded only one-seventh of the maximum possible daily performance. On the last two days, the sum of the packages transported was only fourth-fifth of the maximum daily performance. How many more packages could Max deliver during that week, if he would work at maximum performance?",
        "original_solution": "Max can deliver a maximum of 35 * 7 = 245 packages in one week.\nFor two days Max has carried the maximum number of packages, which in total means 2 * 35 = 70 packages.\nOne day Max has carried only 1/7 of the maximum capacity, that is 1/7 * 35 = 5 packages.\nOn two other days, Max delivered only 4/5 * 35 = 28 packages.\nThat means, Max could deliver 245 - 28 - 5 - 70 - 50 = 92 more packages.\n#### 92",

        "explanation": "The transformation occurs at step 4 where the original multiplication operation 4/5 * 35 is incorrectly changed to a division 4/5 / 35. Because the original amount in question is much larger than 1 and we are dividing something less than one (4/5) by 35, the result is significantly smaller and closer to zero. Thus, the calculation shows 0.8/35 is approximately 0 packages. This wrong operator leads to an incorrect step calculation and affects the final step where the total number of additional packages Max could deliver is calculated.
