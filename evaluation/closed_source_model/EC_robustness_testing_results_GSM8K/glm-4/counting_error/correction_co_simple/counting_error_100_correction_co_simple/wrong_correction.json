        "question": "Emily wants to know how much it rained last week. She sees that it rained 2 inches on Monday morning and 1 more inch later that day. It rained twice that much on Tuesday. It did not rain on Wednesday but on Thursday it rained 1 inch. The biggest storm was on Friday when the total was equal to Monday through Thursday combined. What was the daily average rain total for the week?",
        "original_solution": "The total rain was 2 inches + 1 inches = 3 inches on Monday.\nThe total rain was 2 * 3 inches = 6 inches on Tuesday.\nThe total rain was 0 inches + 1 inch = 1 inch across Wednesday and Thursday.\nThe total rain was 3 inches + 6 inches + 1 inch = 10 inches on Friday.\nThere were 3 inches + 6 inches + 1 inch + 10 inches = 20 inches total last week.\n20 inches/5 days = 4 inches average daily rain.\n#### 4",

        "transformed_solution": "The total rain was 2 inches + 1 inches = 3 inches on Monday.\nThe total rain was 2 * 3 inches = 6 inches on Tuesday.\nThe total rain was 0 inches + 1 inch = 1 inch across Wednesday and Thursday.\nThe total rain was 3 inches + 6 inches + 1 inch = 10 inches on Friday.\nThere were 3 inches + 6 inches + 1 inch + 10 inches = 20 inches total from Monday to Thursday.\n20 inches/4 days = 5 inches average daily rain.\n#### 5",

        "wrong_step": 5,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 5 incorrectly counts the number of days. In the transformed_solution, the divisor has been mistakenly changed from 5 days to 4 days (Monday to Thursday), excluding Friday. This incorrect counting affects step 6, changing the average daily rain calculation from 20/5=4 inches to 20/4=5 inches, thus leading to a different transformed_answer.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "The total rain was 2 inches + 1 inches = 3 inches on Monday.\nThe total rain was 2 * 3 inches = 6 inches on Tuesday.\nThere was no rain on Wednesday, so the total remains 6 inches + 3 inches = 9 inches up to Wednesday.\nThe total rain was 9 inches + 1 inch = 10 inches on Thursday.\nThe total rain was 2 * 10 inches = 20 inches on Friday.\nThere were 3 inches + 6 inches + 0 inches + 1 inch + 20 inches = 30 inches total for the week.\n30 inches/5 days = 6 inches average daily rain.",
        "corrected_answer": "6.0",
        "corrected_explanation": "The error in the original solution is a counting error on two fronts: it incorrectly combines Wednesday and Thursday's rain into one day, and it also counts Friday's rain as the sum of Monday through Thursday, which is incorrect. The corrected solution correctly calculates the total rain for each day and the total for the whole week, then divides by the correct number of days, which is 5."
