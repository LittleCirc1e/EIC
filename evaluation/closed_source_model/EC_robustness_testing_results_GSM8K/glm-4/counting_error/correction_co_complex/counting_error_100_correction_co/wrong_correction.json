        "question": "On Saturdays and Sundays, Suzanne makes french toast for the family. She and her husband each have 1 whole slice and her daughters split 1 slice. She uses a thick sliced bread that comes 12 slices per loaf. Over 52 weeks, how many loaves of bread will she need to make french toast?",
        "original_solution": "She and her husband have 1 slice each and her children split 1 slice so that's 1+1+.5+.5 = 3 slices\nShe makes 3 pieces of french toast on Saturday and Sunday for a total of 3*2 = 6 slices per weekend\nIf she uses 6 slices per weekend then over 52 weeks she will have used 6*52 = 312 slices\nShe gets 12 slices per loaf and she needs 312 slices so she needs 312/12 = 26 loaves\n#### 26",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 mistakenly counts the number of times french toast is made per weekend as 1 time instead of 2 times, resulting in the 3*2 calculation for slices per weekend in the original_solution changed to 3*1 in the transformed_solution. This affects the following step where the total number of slices needed for 52 weeks is also halved from 312 to 156. Subsequently, the calculation in the last step is based on this new total, resulting in the transformed_answer being half of the original_answer. This single counting error of the number of times french toast is made per weekend directly leads to the halved result in the final step of the transformed_solution.",

        "corrected_answer": 14.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "Step 1 first erroneously adds the slices for Suzanne's daughters as 0.5 each, but since they split 1 slice, it should be counted as 1 slice in total. This results in an incorrect calculation of the total number of slices used per weekend. The correct calculation should be 1+1+1 = 3 slices. Subsequent steps are correct, but due to the error in the total slices used, the final loaf calculation is also incorrect. The correct number of loaves needed is 156 slices / 12 slices per loaf = 13 loaves. However, since we need to account for the whole slices, the corrected calculation requires an additional loaf, making it 14 loaves in total."

There is no error in the final answer, but the process was corrected to accurately reflect the slice count."
