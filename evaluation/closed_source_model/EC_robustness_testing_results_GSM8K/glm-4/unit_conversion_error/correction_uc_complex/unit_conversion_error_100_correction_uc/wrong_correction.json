        "question": "Boston had .5 feet of snow on the first day of winter. The next day they got an additional 8 inches. Over the next 2 days, 2 inches of the snow melted. On the fifth day, they received another 2 times the amount of snow they received on the first day. How many feet of snow do they now have?",
        "original_solution": "12 inches is 1 foot and they received a .5 foot of snow on the first day so they received 12*.5 = 6 inches of snow\nThe first day they had 6 inches and then received another 8 inches for a total of 6+8 = 14 inches\n2 inches melted from their 14 inches so that leaves 14-2 = 12 inches of snow\nThey received 2 times the amount as the first day's 6 inches of snow so that's 2*6 = 12 inches of snow\nSo they had 12 inches of snow and received another 12 inches of snow for a total of 12+12 = 24 inches\n12 inches is 1 foot and they have 24 inches of snow so they have 24/12 = 2 feet of snow\n#### 2",

        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 foot is wrongly equal to 10 inches instead of 12 inches, resulting in 12*.5 = 6 inches of snow in the original_solution becoming 10*.5 = 5 inches of snow in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related steps 2, 3, 4, and 5, which changes the intermediate values from 14 inches to 13 inches, from 12 inches to 11 inches, and from 24 inches to 21 inches, respectively. The final result changes from 2 feet of snow to 2.1 feet of snow in the last step.

        "corrected_answer": 2.1,
        "corrected_explanation": "Step 1 makes an incorrect unit conversion by multiplying instead of converting. It should be .5 feet, not 5 inches. This affects the calculation in step 2, which incorrectly adds 5 inches to 8 inches. Step 3 is also affected because the initial amount of snow was incorrect. Steps 4 and 5 correctly account for the melted snow. However, step 6 incorrectly calculates the snow received on the fifth day by using the previously incorrect measure of 5 inches instead of .5 feet. The corrected solution correctly converts all measurements to feet and provides the accurate calculation."
