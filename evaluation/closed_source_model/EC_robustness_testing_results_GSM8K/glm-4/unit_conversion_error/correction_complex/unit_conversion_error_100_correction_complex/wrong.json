        "question": "Every hour past noon shadows from a building stretch an extra 5 feet, starting at zero at noon. How long are the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon in inches?",
        "original_solution": "If the shadows lengthen by 5 feet per hour, this means that in 6 hours the shadows would have lengthened from zero to 5*6=30 feet.\nSince there are 12 inches in every foot, this means the building's shadow would be 30*12= 360 inches in length.\n#### 360",
        "original_answer": 360.0,
        "transformed_solution": "If the shadows lengthen by 5 feet per hour, this means that in 6 hours the shadows would have lengthened from zero to 5*6=30 feet.\nSince there are 10 inches in every foot, this means the building's shadow would be 30*10= 300 inches in length.\n#### 300",
        "transformed_answer": 300.0,
        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 foot is wrongly equal to 10 inches instead of 12 inches, resulting in 30*12= 360 inches in the original_solution becoming 30*10= 300 inches in the transformed_solution. This is the unit conversion error, and the previous calculation step that finds the total feet of shadow after 6 hours remains correct.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "corrected_solution": "none",
        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates that the shadows lengthen by 5 feet per hour and then multiplies this by 6 hours to get a total of 30 feet. It further converts the feet to inches by multiplying by 10, which is the correct conversion factor. Therefore, the final answer of 300 inches is correct."
