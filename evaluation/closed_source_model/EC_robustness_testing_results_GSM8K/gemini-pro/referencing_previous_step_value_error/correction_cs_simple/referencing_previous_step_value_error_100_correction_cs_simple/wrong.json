The subsequent steps related to step 2 have been affected, with step 3 changing from 280-112=168 to 280-120=160. However, the calculation within each step remains correct. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so all other steps still reference this result number correctly, and thus only step 2 has been transformed.",
