        "question": "A driver travels 30 miles per hour for 3 hours and 25 miles per hour for 4 hours to deliver goods to a town every day from Monday to Saturday. How many miles does the driver travel in a week?",
        "original_solution": "The driver travels (3 hours * 30 mph) + (25 mph * 4 hours) = 190 miles per day\nFrom Monday to Saturday he travels in total 190 miles/day * 6 days = 1,140 miles in a week\n#### 1140",
        "original_answer": 1140.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The driver travels (3 hours * 30 mph) + (25 mph * 4 hours) = 190 miles per day\nFrom Monday to Saturday he travels in total 190 miles/day * 5 days = 950 miles in a week\n#### 950",
        "transformed_answer": 950.0,
        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, the error is introduced in step 2 by counting Monday to Saturday as 5 days instead of 6 days, thereby affecting the final computed total distance covered in a week. The 190 miles/day is erroneously multiplied by 5 days to get 950 miles instead of the correct value of 1,140 miles from the original solution. The mistake doesn't affect the previous step of calculating the daily miles or unrelated steps.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "The driver travels (3 hours * 30 mph) + (4 hours * 25 mph) = 175 miles per day\nFrom Monday to Saturday he travels in total 175 miles/day * 5 days = 875 miles in a week\n#### 875",
        "corrected_answer": 875,
        "corrected_explanation": "The mistake in the solution is that it incorrectly multiplies 25 mph by 4 hours instead of 3 hours. This results in an incorrect calculation of the total miles traveled per day. The correct calculation should be (3 hours * 30 mph) + (3 hours * 25 mph) = 175 miles per day."
