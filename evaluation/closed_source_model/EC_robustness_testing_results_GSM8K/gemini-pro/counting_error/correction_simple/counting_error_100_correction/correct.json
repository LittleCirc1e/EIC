        "explanation": "Here, step 2 mistakenly calculates the practice time for Saturday as if Elle practices twice as much as on a weekday instead of three times as much. The incorrect multiplication of 0.50 x 2 = 1.0 hours replaces the correct calculation of 0.50 x 3 = 1.5 hours. This affects the last step, changing the sum from 2.5 + 1.5 = 4 hours to 2.5 + 1.0 = 3.5 hours. The other calculations leading up to the erroneous step remain correct.",
