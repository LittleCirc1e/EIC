        "original_solution": "Madeline spends 4*7=28 hours on homework.\nShe spends 8*7-56 hours sleeping.\nTherefore, she is busy 28+18+56+20=122 hours per week.\nThere are 7*24=168 hours per week.\nThus, Madeline has 168-122=46 hours left over.\n#### 46",

Step 2 of the original_solution, which uses the result 28 from the deleted step, now references the number 4 directly and recalculates the total hours busy per week. The calculation changes from 28+18+56+20=122 to 4*7+18+56+20=144. This does not affect the calculation of step 3 at all, which remains the same. Since step 1 was deleted, we start from step 2 in the transformed_solution, which is a combination of step 1 and step 3 from the original solution. Therefore, the first step that contains an error is step 2 in the transformed_solution, which is equivalent to step 3 in the original_solution. So the wrong_step is 2.",

        "original_solution": "Jean's dress was $10 less than Pauline's $30 dress, meaning it was 30-10= 20 dollars.\nIda's dress was $30 more than Jean's $20 dress, meaning it was 30+20=50 dollars.\nPatty's dress was $10 more than Ida's $50 dress, meaning it was 50+10=60 dollars.\nTherefore, all four women together spent 60+50+20+30=160 dollars.\n#### 160",

        "explanation": "This example removes the intermediate step 2 from the original solution. In the original_solution, the step 2 calculation is based on the results of step 1. After deleting original step 2, the new step 2 should be based on step 1's result, so the formula should now reference the 30 dollars directly rather than the result of deleted step 2's 20 dollars. The number 30 dollars also appears in deleted step 2, so we choose 30 as the reference for the new step 2 because it is the larger number used in the original step 2. Although the new calculation (30+30=60 dollars) makes sense in context, it is incorrect because it does not follow the decrement given in the original question for Jeanâ€™s dress (which is $10 less than $30). The subsequent calculations in step 3 and 4 then inherit this error, leading to the transformed_solution with a first erroneous reference appearing at the new step 2, incorrectly inflating the price of Ida's dress and ultimately the total amount.",

        "explanation": "In this transformation, I have deleted the first step, which involves Andy's return trip from school to his house. The original step 1 involves adding the two 50m trips together for a total of 100m. By removing this step, we no longer account for the return trip from school, and thus the calculation in the transformed solution refers to only one leg of the journey from the house to the school (50m). Since in our transformation we remove step 1, we then modify step 2 to include only one 50m trip, changing the formula from 140m - 100m = 40 meters to 140m - 50m = 90 meters. It should be noted that while the calculation itself is algebraically correct, the premise is wrong because it does not consider the entire trip. The first step (now also the wrong_step) references the correct number from the question and no intermediate steps are present, thus making the entire reasoning incorrect and leading to a different transformed answer.",
