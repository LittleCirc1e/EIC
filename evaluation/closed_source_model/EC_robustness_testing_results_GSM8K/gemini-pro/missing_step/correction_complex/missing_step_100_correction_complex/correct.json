In the transformed_solution, step 1 was eliminated, making the first step (which also happens to be step 2 in the original_solution) directly reference the cost of the silverware from the question. Because step 1 often references a number in the question, the incorrect number used in the transformed solution (the original cost of just the silverware) is also from the question.
