Therefore, after deleting step 1, step 2 should reference result 4 from the question. However, instead of using the correct multiplication and addition, there was a mistake in combining the operations, leading to an incorrect new step of 'Walt's Monday and Tuesday walk were 4+4*6 = 52 miles combined.' This is mathematically incorrect because it does not respect the order of operations (multiplication should be done before addition). This incorrect step results in the subsequent step calculating Walt's Wednesday walk by subtracting 52 from 41, yielding an incorrect negative distance. It is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 2 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing incorrect number in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 1.",

        "corrected_answer": 13.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The first erroneous step is step 1, which incorrectly calculates the combined mileage of Monday and Tuesday as 52 miles instead of 28 miles. This is because it multiplies Monday's mileage by 6 instead of 4. This error affects the subsequent step 2, where the Wednesday mileage is incorrectly calculated as -11 miles instead of 13 miles. The correct calculation should be 41-28=13."

        "explanation": "The first step of the original solution was deleted. In the original_solution, this step involves subtracting the count of both the red and blue pebbles from the total, to get the remainder, which was then divided equally amongst 3 groups. After deletion, the transformed solution starts with the subtraction of red pebbles only. This causes a change in subsequent calculations, where now the total number of pebbles is divided by 4 groups instead of 3, which is a mistake because the question specifies the remaining pebbles are divided into 3 groups, not 4. This incorrect modification affects the calculation of yellow pebbles resulting in a different answer, as the division would then include the blue pebbles in the count. The referenced 31 after deletion is incorrect because it included blue pebble count which should still have been excluded. Because the deletion involved an early computational step, the wrong_step is 1.",

However, the correct process is to find the number of orange marbles first before calculating the number of purple marbles as 4 times the orange marbles. The subsequent step also changes: it no longer includes orange marbles in the total count, making the formula change from 13+4+16=33 to 13+16=29.
