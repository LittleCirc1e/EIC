It should be noted that the calculation of step 2 and step 3 after the transformation is still a correct continuation from the previous steps.

We can do this by subtracting the number of seconds he holds his breath on the first day from the number of seconds he holds his breath on the second day: 20 - 10 = 10. This tells us that he is increasing the number of seconds he holds his breath by 10 seconds each day.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many times he needs to increase the number of seconds he holds his breath by 10 in order to reach 90 seconds. We can do this by dividing 90 by 10: 90 / 10 = 9. This tells us that he needs to increase the number of seconds he holds his breath by 10 nine times in order to reach 90 seconds.\n\nFinally, we need to add 1 to this number to account for the first day when he held his breath for 10 seconds. This gives us a total of 9 + 1 = 10 days.\n",

As a result, Tracy and Jake's combined weight is incorrectly listed as 52+52 kg, and the remaining steps are updated accordingly to keep consistency.
