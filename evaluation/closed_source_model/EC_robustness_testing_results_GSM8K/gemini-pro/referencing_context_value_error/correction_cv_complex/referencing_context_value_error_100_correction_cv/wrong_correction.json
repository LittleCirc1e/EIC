        "question": "In soccer, players receive yellow cards when they are cautioned and red cards when they are sent off. Coach Tim has a team of 11 players, 5 of them didn't receive cautions, the rest received one yellow card each. How many red cards would the whole team collect, knowing that each red card corresponds to 2 yellow cards?",
        "original_solution": "In coach Tim's team, 5 out of 11 players did not receive any caution, so 11 - 5 = 6 players were cautioned.\nEach cautioned player received a yellow card, so all the cautioned players received 6 * 1 = 6 yellow cards.\nKnowing that each red card corresponds to 2 yellow cards, the team would have 6 / 2 = 3 red cards.\n#### 3",
        "original_answer": 3.0,
        "transformed_solution": "In coach Tim's team, 10 out of 11 players did not receive any caution, so 11 - 10 = 1 player was cautioned.\nEach cautioned player received a yellow card, so the cautioned player received 1 * 1 = 1 yellow card.\nKnowing that each red card corresponds to 2 yellow cards, the team would have 1 / 2 = 0.5 red cards.\n#### 0.5",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 1 references 5 in the question as 10 wrongly, and calculates 11 - 10 = 1 instead of 11 - 5 = 6. Its subsequent related steps will be affected by the erroneous result but still be calculated correctly. Step 2 changes from 6 * 1 = 6 yellow cards to 1 * 1 = 1 yellow card, and step 3 changes from 6 / 2 = 3 red cards to 1 / 2 = 0.5 red cards. Please note that you should only consider one error, so step 2 and 3 still correctly calculate results based on the erroneous first step.",

        "corrected_explanation": "Step 1 first makes an error in referencing the number of the question description <5 of them didn't receive cautions>. It erroneously references 5 as 10, causing the formula to calculate 11 - 10 = 1 instead of 11 - 6 = 5. This affects subsequent steps 2, 3, and 4 that reference its result. Step 2 incorrectly calculates 1 * 1 = 1 instead of 5 * 1 = 5. Step 3 incorrectly calculates 1 / 2 = 0.5 instead of 5 / 2 = 2.5. And step 4 incorrectly outputs 0.5 instead of 2.5."
