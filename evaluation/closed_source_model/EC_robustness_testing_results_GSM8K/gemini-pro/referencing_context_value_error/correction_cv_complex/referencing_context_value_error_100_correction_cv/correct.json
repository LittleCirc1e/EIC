        "corrected_solution": "During each boat trip, there can be 12 people onboard, so during 4 boat trips, there can be 4 * 12 = 48 people in total.\nDuring two days the boat can transport a total of 48 * 2 = 96 people.\n#### 96",
        "corrected_answer": 96.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "Step 1 first makes an error in referencing the number of the question description <The boat can take up to 12 people during one trip.>. It erroneously references 12 as 10, causing the formula to calculate 4 * 10 = 40 instead of 4 * 12 = 48. This affects subsequent step 2 that references its result. Step 2 incorrectly calculates 40 * 2 = 80 instead of 48 * 2 = 96."
