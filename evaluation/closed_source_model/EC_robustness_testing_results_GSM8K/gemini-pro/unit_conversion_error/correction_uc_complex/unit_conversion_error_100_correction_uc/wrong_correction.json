        "explanation": "Here, step 3 falsely infers that there are 70 minutes in an hour instead of 60 minutes, thus the intermediate calculation changes from 60/60 = 1 hour in the original_solution to 60/70 = 0.857 hours in the transformed_solution. This error subsequently affects the calculation in step 4, where the total time required from start to finish changes from 3+1 = 4 hours to 3+0.857 = 3.857 hours. Finally, it impacts the result in step 5, calculating the latest time the baker can start working from 6:00 am. Instead of the original 2:00 am, the falsely transformed solution indicates it's 2:08.6 am, which rounds to 2:09 am. Therefore, the transformed answer is 2.15 hours represented in decimal format which corresponds to 2:09 am. Note that the error is only introduced once and the unrelated steps remain unaffected.",
