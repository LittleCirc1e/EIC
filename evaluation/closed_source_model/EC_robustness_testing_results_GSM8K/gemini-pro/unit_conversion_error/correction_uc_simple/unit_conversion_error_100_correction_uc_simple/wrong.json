        "question": "Some friends wanted to make a road trip from New York to Los Angeles. They drove at a constant speed of 62 miles/hour, taking breaks of 30 minutes every 5 hours. Once in the city, they looked for the hotel for 30 minutes. If the trip took around 2,790 miles, how many hours will they have to spend to complete the trip to the hotel?",
        "original_solution": "At a constant speed of 62 miles/hour, they will drive 2,790 miles / 62 miles/hour = 45 hours in total.\nEvery 5 hours they take a break, they will take 45 hours / 5 hours/break = 9 breaks.\nThose breaks will be 9 breaks x 30 minutes/break = 270 minutes in total.\nIn hours, the breaks will be in total 270 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 4.5 hours\nTo find the hotel it took them 30 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 0.5 hours\nIn total, it will take 45 hours + 4.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 50 hours to complete the trip.\n#### 50",

        "explanation": "In step 3, the duration of each break is incorrectly converted to 50 minutes instead of the correct 30 minutes, resulting in 9 breaks x 50 minutes/break = 450 minutes in total. This error affects the calculation of the total break time in step 4, changing the duration from 270 minutes to 450 minutes, and the corresponding total time in hours from 4.5 to 7.5 hours. This miscalculation then affects the final total time needed to complete the trip to the hotel in step 5, from 50 hours to 53 hours. The previous steps, including the calculation of the driving time and the number of breaks, remain unaffected by this error.",

Her shopping trip took an hour and a half. How many minutes did Josie spend shopping instead of waiting?",
