        "question": "If a bunny comes out of its burrow 3 times per minute, calculate the combined number of times 20 bunnies at the same pace will have come out of their burrows in 10 hours.",
        "original_solution": "If a bunny comes out of its hole three times in a minute, in an hour, with 60 minutes, the bunny will come out of the hole 60*3=180 times.\nIn 10 hours, a bunny will come out of their hole 180*10=1800 times.\nThe combined time that 20 bunnies coming out of their holes will have taken in 10 hours is 1800*20=36000 times.\n#### 36000",
        "original_answer": 36000.0,
        "transformed_solution": "If a bunny comes out of its hole three times in a minute, in an hour, with 50 minutes, the bunny will come out of the hole 50*3=150 times.\nIn 10 hours, a bunny will come out of their hole 150*10=1500 times.\nThe combined time that 20 bunnies coming out of their holes will have taken in 10 hours is 1500*20=30000 times.\n#### 30000",

        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes incorrect unit conversion, which assumes that there are 50 minutes in an hour instead of the correct 60 minutes. This results in a cascade of errors through the subsequent steps. The original_solution stating that a bunny will come out of the hole 60*3=180 times is transformed to 50*3=150 times. Consequently, the 10-hour total for one bunny changes from 180*10=1800 in the original_solution to 150*10=1500 in the transformed_solution. The final combined count for 20 bunnies then changes from 1800*20=36000 times to 1500*20=30000 times. It should be noted that only one step of unit conversion error is considered and the rest of calculation steps are kept consistent with the original solution.",

        "original_solution": "If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12*1=12 inches=1 foot.\nSince Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, then Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4*1=4 feet.\nAnd since Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami. then Naruto can lift a mountain 10*4=40 feet.\n#### 40",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 12 inches is wrongly equal to 1 yard instead of 1 foot, resulting in 12*1=12 inches=1 foot in the original_solution becoming 12*1=12 inches=1 yard in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 2 and 3. Step 2 changes from 4*1=4 feet to 4*1=4 yards. Step 3 changes from 10*4=40 feet to 10*4=40 yards (noting there are 3 feet in a yard, the actual transformation is 10*4*3 = 120 feet). It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, so the other computation steps are still correct.",
