        "question": "In a rice field, you can get a total of 20 sacks of rice every harvest. If the yield increases by twenty percent after every harvest, what is the total number of sacks of rice you can get after the first and second harvest?",
        "original_solution": "There were 20 x 0.20 = 4 sacks of rice increase after the first harvest.\nSo the total sack of rice that you can get on the next harvest 20 + 4 = 24.\nTherefore the total number of sacks of rice you will get on the first and second harvest is 20 + 24 = 44.\n#### 44",
        "original_answer": 44.0,
        "transformed_solution": "There were 20 / 0.20 = 100 sacks of rice increase after the first harvest.\nSo the total sack of rice that you can get on the next harvest 20 + 100 = 120.\nTherefore the total number of sacks of rice you will get on the first and second harvest is 20 + 120 = 140.\n#### 140",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example changes the multiplication in step 1 to division by switching * to /, changing 20 x 0.20 = 4 to 20 / 0.20 = 100. This incorrectly increases the amount of rice increase after the first harvest. Consequently, all subsequent steps are affected by this change: step 2 changes from 20 + 4 = 24 to 20 + 100 = 120, and step 3 changes the total sacks of rice from 20 + 24 = 44 to 20 + 120 = 140. The calculations for each step after the modified operator are correct, but derived from the incorrect initial step.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "The yield increases by 20% after every harvest, so the total number of sacks of rice after the first harvest is 20 * (1 + 20%) = 20 * 1.2 = 24. The total number of sacks of rice after the second harvest is 24 * (1 + 20%) = 24 * 1.2 = 28.8.",
        "corrected_answer": 28.8,
        "corrected_explanation": "The corrected solution first calculates the total number of sacks of rice after the first harvest, and then calculates the total number of sacks of rice after the second harvest."

        "question": "Maiya has two sisters. The first sister is twice as old as Maiya. The first sister is 1 year younger than Maiya. Their average age is 5. How old is Maiya?",
        "original_solution": "Their total age is 15 because 3 x 5 = 15\n15 - X - 2X - (X-1) is equivalent to 16 = 4X\nMaiya is 4 years old because 16 / 4 = 4\n#### 4",

        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The error is introduced by changing the subtraction of (X - 1) to addition in the second step. This turns the equation 15 - X - 2X - (X-1) = 16 = 4X into 15 - X - 2X + (X-1) = 16 = 2X, incorrectly simplifying the ages. All other aspects of the solution are correct, including the arithmetic in the transformed steps. This leads to a different incorrect result for Maiya's age.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Let Maiya's age be X. Then the first sister's age is 2X-1 and the second sister's age is X-1. The average age of the three sisters is 5, so we can set up the equation (X + 2X-1 + X-1) / 3 = 5. Solving for X, we get X = 8.",

        "explanation": "This example changes the multiplication operator in step 1 to a division operator by changing 50 * 9 to 50 / 9, which incorrectly calculates the number of students Adam will teach in 9 years as 5.56. The second step is updated to add this incorrect value to the 40 students taught in the first year, deriving 5 + 40 = 45.
