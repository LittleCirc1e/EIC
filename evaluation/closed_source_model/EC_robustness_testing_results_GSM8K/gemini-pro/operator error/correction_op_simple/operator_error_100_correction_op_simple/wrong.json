        "question": "A fisherman catches 3 types of fish in his net. There are 32 bass, 1/4 as many trout as bass, and double the number of blue gill as bass. How many fish did the fisherman catch total?",
        "original_solution": "Bass:32\nTrout:32/4=8\nBlue Gill:2(32)=64\nTotal:32+8+64=104 fish\n#### 104",
        "original_answer": 104.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Bass:32\nTrout:32/4=8\nBlue Gill:32*3=96\nTotal:32+8+96=136 fish\n#### 136",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This transformed solution mistakenly changes the multiplication factor from 2 to 3 in the calculation of the number of Blue Gill. The original operation was to double the number of bass, 2(32)=64, but has been incorrectly transformed to a triple calculation, 32*3=96. This leads to an erroneous total count of fish, with steps 3 and 4 reflecting this incorrect calculation. It should be noted that the operator change (from *2 to *3) in step 3 is the only error introduced; the rest of the calculations are executed correctly based on this wrong assumption.",
