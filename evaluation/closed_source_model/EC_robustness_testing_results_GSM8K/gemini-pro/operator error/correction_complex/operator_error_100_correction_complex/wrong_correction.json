        "question": "A store decides to shut down and sell all of its inventory. They have 2000 different items which would normally retail for $50. They are offering an 80% discount and manage to sell 90% of the items. They owed $15000 to their creditors. How much money do they have left after the sale?",
        "original_solution": "They sold 2000*.9=1800 items\nThey offered a 50*.8=$40 discount\nThat means that each item sold for 50-40=$10\nSo they made 1800*10=$18,000\nSo they had 18,000-15,000=$3,000 leftover\n#### 3000",
        "original_answer": 3000.0,
        "transformed_solution": "They sold 2000*.9=1800 items\nThey offered a 50/.8=$62.50 discount\nThat means that each item sold for 50-62.50=$-12.50\nSo they made 1800*-12.50=$-22,500\nSo they had -22,500-15,000=$-37,500 leftover\n#### -37500",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example turns the multiplication in step 2 into division, changing 50*.8=$40 to 50/.8=$62.50 by changing * to /. The subsequent steps 3, 4, and 5 inherit this result. Step 3 changes from 50-40=$10 to 50-62.50=$-12.50, creating an erroneous negative value for the selling price. Consequently, step 4 changes from 1800*10=$18,000 to 1800*-12.50=$-22,500, resulting in a negative sales total. This negative revenue leads to step 5 wherein the store's leftover money turns from a positive value (18,000-15,000=$3,000) to a negative value (-22,500-15,000=$-37,500), suggesting the store is in debt after the sale. The mistake lies only in step 2's operator, but its calculation is correct, affecting all the subsequent steps that rely on its flawed result. The calculations in the subsequent steps are correctly executed with respect to the altered step 2 result.",

The second step is updated to add this incorrect value to the 40 students taught in the first year, deriving 5 + 40 = 45.
