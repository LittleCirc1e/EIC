        "original_solution": "8 * 4 = 32 square feet\n20 * 32 = 640 square feet\n5040 - 640 = 4400 square feet\nThere are 42 - 20 = 22 remaining units\n4400/22 = 200 square feet\nOne of the remaining units is 200 square feet.\n#### 200",

        "transformed_solution": "8 + 4 + 8 + 4 = 24 square feet\n20 * 24 = 480 square feet\n5040 - 480 = 4560 square feet\nThere are 42 - 20 = 22 remaining units\n4560/22 = 207.27 square feet\nOne of the remaining units is 207.27 square feet.\n#### 207.27",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the area with perimeter. The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width, not the sum of all sides, which is equivalent to the perimeter. This changes the solution from \"8 * 4 = 32 square feet\" in the original_solution to \"8 + 4 + 8 + 4 = 24 square feet\" in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 2, where the calculation changes from \"20 * 32 = 640 square feet\" to \"20 * 24 = 480 square feet\". The subsequent steps carry the error forward, altering the final answer. Note that only step 1 erroneously uses the perimeter formula, while the other calculation processes follow correctly.",

She replaced flooring in two areas of the bathroom: a 10 foot by 10 foot central area, and a 6 foot by 4 foot hallway.  How many square feet of hardwood flooring did Nancy install in her bathroom?",
        "original_solution": "10 feet by 10 feet central area is 10*10=100 square feet of space.\n6 feet by 4 feet hallway is 4*6=24 square feet of space.\nCombined, the two areas where she replaced flooring contain 100+24=124 square feet of space.\n#### 124",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and area of square. The question requires that the area of the square to be solved be equal to side length multiplied by side length, rather than the side length added together four times, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the square, resulting in 10*10=100 square feet in the original_solution being changed to 10+10+10+10=40 square feet in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 3, changing from 100+24=124 square feet to 40+24=64 square feet. Note that the language description of step 1 < 10 feet by 10 feet central area is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. Also, only step 1 mistakenly uses the formula of square area, while step 2 correctly uses the formula of rectangular area, and other steps are correctly calculated based on the modified step 1.",
