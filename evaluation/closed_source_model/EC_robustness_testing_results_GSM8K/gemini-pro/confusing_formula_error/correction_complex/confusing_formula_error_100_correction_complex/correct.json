        "question": "Mary is making a model sailboat. She wants to add three sails: a rectangular sail that measures 5 inches by 8 inches and two right triangular sails, one that's 3 inches long at the bottom and 4 inches tall and one that's 4 inches long at the bottom and 6 inches tall. (Remember you can find the area of a triangle by dividing the area of a square with the same height and length by 2). How many square inches of canvas does she need total?",
        "original_solution": "First find the area of the square sail: 5 inches * 8 inches = 40 square inches\nThen find the area of a square sail with the same height and length as the first triangular sail: 3 inches * 4 inches = 12 square inches\nThen divide the area in two to find the area of the triangular sail: 12 square inches / 2 = 6 square inches\nThen find the area of a square sail with the same height and length as the second triangular sail: 4 inches * 6 inches = 24 square inches\nThen divide the area in two to find the area of the triangular sail: 24 square inches / 2 = 12 square inches\nThen add up the areas of all the sails to find the total amount of canvas needed: 12 square inches + 6 square inches + 40 square inches = 58 square inches\n#### 58",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the perimeter and area of a square. The question requires that the area of the triangular sail to be solved be equal to the half of the area of a square with the same height and length. Instead, the perimeter of the square with the same height and length was mistakenly calculated, resulting in 3 inches * 4 inches = 12 square inches in the original_solution being changed to 3 inches + 4 inches + 3 inches + 4 inches = 14 square inches in the transformed_solution. This incorrect calculation affects the subsequent step 3, which divides the incorrect perimeter in half instead of dividing the correct area in half. The division calculation remains correct, but the input value is wrong due to the previous mistake. All other steps should continue to use correct formulas, ensuring that only one error is introduced in the transformation process. In this example, only step 2 mistakenly confuses the concepts of perimeter and area, while for step 3, division is still correct in form, but it is misapplied based on the incorrect previous step, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",

She then packs those cartons into a shipping box before sending it to the loading bay. The shipping boxes are 20 inches wide, 20 inches long, and 20 inches high. How many widgets get shipped in each shipping box?",
        "original_solution": "Each carton has an area of 4*4*5 = 80 square inches.\nEach shipping box has an area of 20*20*20 = 8000 square inches\nThe total number of cartons that will fit into each box is 8000/80 = 100\nSince there are 3 widgets in each carton, the total number of cartons in each box will be 3*100 = 300\n#### 300",

        "explanation": "Here, the second step confuses the volume and perimeter of a cube. The total area should be the volume of a cube (length * width * height), not the sum of the edges which constitutes the perimeter. In this case, the edge lengths should be multiplied as length * width * height for volume. But instead, the sum of the lengths of all edges has been calculated as if it were a perimeter. This results in 20*20*20 being transformed to 20+20+20+20+20+20, which affects the subsequent step 3, changing from 8000/80=100 to 120/80=1.5. The language description remains unchanged despite the incorrect transformation in step 2. It is important to note that this transformation introduces only one step of a confusing formula error (volume vs. perimeter confusion), and the other calculation processes remain correct. The final answer differs from the original, illustrating the impact of using an incorrect formula.",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and area of rectangle. The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the sum of all sides, which is equivalent to finding the perimeter of the rectangle, resulting in the correct formula 8 x 12 = 96 in the original_solution being changed to 8 + 12 + 8 + 12 = 40 in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 2, changing from 96 x 8 = 768 to 40 x 8 = 320. Note that the language description of step 1 < The area of a glass pane is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 1 mistakenly uses the formula of rectangular area, while the other calculation processes are still correct.",
