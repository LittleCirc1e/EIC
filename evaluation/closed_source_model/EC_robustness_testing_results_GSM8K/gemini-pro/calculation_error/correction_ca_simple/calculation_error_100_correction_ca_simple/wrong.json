Each floor has 6 apartments, and each apartment needs 7 doors in total. How many doors does the company need to buy?",
        "original_solution": "The number of floors is 12 floors/building x 2 buildings = 24 floors\nThe number of apartments is 6 apartments/floor x 24 floors = 144 apartments\nThe company has to buy 7 doors/apartment x 144 apartments = 1008 doors\n#### 1008",

This is a calculation error, as it should be 7 * 144 = 1008. The previous steps (1 and 2) remain unchanged as they are correct and unrelated to the erroneous step 3. The error only affects the last calculation step and the final answer, without changing any of the operands or operators in the formula, but the calculation itself is incorrect, and there is a single error in the process.",
