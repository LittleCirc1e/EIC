        "question": "Joseph had socks of many different colors. His dresser drawer was filled to overflowing with red, blue, black, and white socks. Uncertain of how many pairs he had of each color, he began to sort his socks. He discovered that he had three more pairs of blue socks than he had pairs of black socks. He had one less pair of red socks than he had pairs of white socks. He had twice as many blue socks as he had of red socks. And he counted a total of 6 red socks. What is the total number of Joseph's socks?",
        "original_solution": "Starting with 6 red socks, twice the number of blue socks as red meant Joseph had 2*6=12 blue socks.\nWith one less pair of red socks than white socks, this meant 2 fewer red socks than white, for a total of 6-2=4 white socks.\nAlso, 12 blue socks=6 pairs of blue socks.\nWith three more pairs of blue socks than pairs of black socks, this means he had 6-3=3 pairs of black socks.\nAnd three pairs of black socks corresponds to 3*2=6 black socks.\nThus, in total, he had 6+12+4+6=28 socks.\n#### 28",

After deleting this step, step 5 instantaneously refers to the number of blue socks pairs by dividing by 2 (since 1 pair equals 2 socks), which changes the formula from 6-3=3 pairs of black socks to 6/2-3=0 pairs of black socks. The change leads to calculating 0 black socks instead of 6, and the remaining steps that calculate the total number of socks refer to this new value. Therefore, removing step 4 causes a fundamental miscalculation in the number of black socks, leading to the first erroneous reference at step 5 in the transformed solution. It should be noted that the number 3 from step 5, referring to how many fewer pairs of black socks there are compared to blue, remains intact as the required reference from the question.

The solution also incorrectly calculates the number of black socks in step 3. Since Joseph has three more pairs of blue socks than black socks, and he has 6 pairs of blue socks, he must have 3 pairs of black socks, which is 6 black socks.

        "corrected_solution": "He spends 2 years getting in shape for mountain climbing\nHe then spends twice that long, which is 2 * 2 = 4 years, learning to be a technically proficient mountain climber\nHe spends 5 months climbing each mountain for all 7 mountains, which is 5 * 7 = 35 months\nHe takes 13 months learning to dive\nHe then spends 2 years diving through all the caves\nTo find the total time, we need to convert the months into years for consistency: 35 months / 12 = 2 years and 11 months\nAdding the 13 months of learning to dive, we get 2 years and 11 months + 13 months = 3 years and 11 months\nNow we add up all the years: 2 (getting in shape) + 4 (learning to climb) + 2 (diving) + 3 (climbing and learning to dive in years) = 11 years\nWe also have the remaining 11 months from the climbing and learning to dive\nSo in total it all took 11 years and 11 months\n#### 11.916666666666666",
        "corrected_answer": 11.916666666666666,
        "corrected_explanation": "The first erroneous step is step 3, where the solution incorrectly converts 48 months directly into 4 years without considering the additional months that would result from the conversion. The correct approach is to first convert the 35 months of climbing into years and then add the 13 months of learning to dive. This results in 3 years and 11 months, not 4 years. The final total should include the years spent getting in shape, learning to climb, climbing, and diving, as well as the additional 11 months, resulting in 11 years and 11 months."
