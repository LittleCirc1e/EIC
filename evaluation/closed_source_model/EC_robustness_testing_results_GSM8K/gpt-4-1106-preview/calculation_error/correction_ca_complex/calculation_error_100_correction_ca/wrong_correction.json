        "explanation": "The transformed_solution introduces a calculation error at step 1 by mistakenly counting each family unit as having 4 people instead of 3. This error then changes the expected number of people from each family unit and alters all the subsequent steps that rely on this number.

This wrong step then impacts the rest of the solution, with the initial number of candies being incorrectly calculated as 12 * 2 = 24 instead of the correct 11 * 2 = 22.

The correct calculation should consider that the 7 candies were the remaining half after Jack took half plus 4 more candies.

        "explanation": "This transformed solution has a calculation error in step 2 where 45/5 is incorrectly calculated as 7 instead of 9. This is the only calculation error present, and hence there is a single error. The correct calculation should have yielded that it will take 9 weeks, not 7 weeks.

        "corrected_solution": "He needs to do 15 wall push-ups, then 15 high elevation push-ups, and then 15 low elevation push-ups before he starts floor push-ups. That's a total of 15 reps for each type of push-up, and there are 3 types before floor push-ups, so he needs to do 15*3=45 progressions.\nSince he trains 5 days a week, it will take him 45/5=9 days to complete all progressions.\nHowever, since he trains only 5 days a week, we need to convert days into weeks. There are 7 days in a week, but he only trains 5 days, so it will take him 9/5=1.8 weeks. Since he cannot train for a fraction of a week, we round up to the next whole week, which means it will take him 2 weeks to get to floor push-ups.\n#### 2",

        "corrected_explanation": "Step 2 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, dividing 45 by 5 to get 7 weeks instead of 9 days. The correct calculation is 45/5=9 days. Since John trains 5 days a week, it will take him 9/5=1.8 weeks, which rounds up to 2 weeks, to get to floor push-ups."
