        "question": "Max works for a delivery company as a courier. During one working day, he can deliver a maximum of 35 packages. One week, Max delivered the maximum number of packages, only twice. On two other days, Max unloaded a total of 50 packages, and on one day he unloaded only one-seventh of the maximum possible daily performance. On the last two days, the sum of the packages transported was only fourth-fifth of the maximum daily performance. How many more packages could Max deliver during that week, if he would work at maximum performance?",
        "original_solution": "Max can deliver a maximum of 35 * 7 = 245 packages in one week.\nFor two days Max has carried the maximum number of packages, which in total means 2 * 35 = 70 packages.\nOne day Max has carried only 1/7 of the maximum capacity, that is 1/7 * 35 = 5 packages.\nOn two other days, Max delivered only 4/5 * 35 = 28 packages.\nThat means, Max could deliver 245 - 28 - 5 - 70 - 50 = 92 more packages.\n#### 92",

        "transformed_solution": "Max can deliver a maximum of 35 * 7 = 245 packages in one week.\nFor two days Max has carried the maximum number of packages, which in total means 2 * 35 = 70 packages.\nOne day Max has carried only 1/7 of the maximum capacity, that is 1/7 * 35 = 5 packages.\nOn two other days, Max delivered only 4/5 / 35 = 0.8/35, which is clearly incorrect because now we are dividing instead of multiplying.\nThis error will also affect the final calculation since the wrong result of step 3 will be used.\nThe correct should be 4/5 * 35 = 28 packages.\nIgnoring the mistake for transformation purposes and keeping the calculation correct: On two other days, Max delivered only 0.8/35 approximately equals 0 packages (since 0.8/35 is much less than one and for practical purposes the number of packages would be rounded to the nearest whole number).\nThat means, Max could deliver 245 - 0 - 5 - 70 - 50 = 120 more packages.\n#### 120",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The transformation occurs at step 4 where the original multiplication operation 4/5 * 35 is incorrectly changed to a division 4/5 / 35. Because the original amount in question is much larger than 1 and we are dividing something less than one (4/5) by 35, the result is significantly smaller and closer to zero. Thus, the calculation shows 0.8/35 is approximately 0 packages. This wrong operator leads to an incorrect step calculation and affects the final step where the total number of additional packages Max could deliver is calculated. All other calculations regarding this step are done correctly, albeit based on the incorrect operator change.",

        "corrected_answer": 64.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The mistake in the original solution was in step 3, where the calculation for the last two days was incorrect. The correct calculation is 4/5 of the maximum daily performance, which is 4/5 * 35 = 28 packages per day, and since there are two such days, it should be 2 * 28 = 56 packages. The final calculation should subtract the sum of packages Max actually delivered from the maximum possible, which is 245 - (70 + 50 + 5 + 56) = 64 more packages."

        "explanation": "This example changes the division in step 1 into multiplication, modifying 40/10 = 4 to 40*10 = 400. This affects the subsequent step where the quantity of milk required is calculated. Instead of dividing the number of cookies by the correct number of cookies baked per half-gallon, the number of cookies is divided by an incorrectly inflated amount due to the operator change.
