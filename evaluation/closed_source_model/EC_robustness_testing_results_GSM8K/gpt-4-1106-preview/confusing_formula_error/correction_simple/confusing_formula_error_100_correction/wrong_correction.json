        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The proper method is to multiply the length and width for area, but instead, the formula for perimeter, which is the sum of all sides, was used, resulting in 15+20+15+20=70 square feet instead of 15*20=300 square feet. This mistake affected subsequent steps that depend on the area of one room. Step 5 changes from 4*300=1200 square feet to 4*70=280 square feet, and step 6 changes from 300*2=600 square feet to 70*2=140 square feet, leading to an incorrect final answer in step 7 of 280+140=420 square feet. While step 1 and step 2 correctly add 2 feet to each dimension, it is step 3 that errors in calculation, and it should be noted only this step features a confusing formula error, as the rest of the calculations follow properly from it.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The area of a room is found by multiplying the length by the width. After increasing each dimension by 2 feet, the new dimensions are 15 feet by 20 feet. The area of each room is therefore 15*20=300 square feet. With 3 rooms of this size, the total is 3*300=900 square feet. The room that is twice as big has an area of 300*2=600 square feet. Adding these together gives a total area of 900+600=1500 square feet."
