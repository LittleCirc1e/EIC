The question requires calculating the area of the square rooms which is side length multiplied by side length, rather than the sum of all sides of the square which equals its perimeter. This changes 11 * 11 = 121 square feet in the original_solution to 11 + 11 + 11 + 11 = 44 square feet in the transformed_solution. The subsequent steps that depend on the area of the bedrooms are affected, altering the calculations in step 2 from 121 * 4 = 484 square feet to 44 * 4 = 176 square feet and consequently the rest of the calculation leading up to the kitchen area from 530/2 = 265 to 838/2 = 419 square feet. The original language descriptions in the steps remain unchanged. It should be noted that only step 1 mistakenly uses the formula for perimeter, while all other calculations relevant to the problem are performed correctly.",

As a result, the original solution's equation '100 = L * W' turned into '100 = L + W' in the transformed solution. This causes a chain reaction affecting the subsequent calculations.

Note that the language description of step 1 < First find the area of one side of a roof > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. Likewise, the wrong_type should remain consistent as 'confusing_formula_error' since the formula used for calculation has been mistakenly used from the perimeter instead of the area, and it is still a single error affecting all the subsequent steps based on the area calculation.",

        "question": "John carves a giant marble rectangular prism 8 meters tall with a 2-meter square base. It has a density of 2700 kg per cubic meter. How much does it weigh?",
        "original_solution": "The marble statue has a volume of 2*2*8=32 cubic meters\nSo that means it has a weight of 2700*32=86,400 kg\n#### 86,400",
        "original_answer": 86400.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The marble statue has a volume of 2+2+2+2=8 cubic meters\nSo that means it has a weight of 2700*8=21,600 kg\n#### 21,600",
        "transformed_answer": 21600.0,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and volume calculations. The original_solution properly calculates the volume of the rectangular prism by multiplying the side of the square base with itself and then by the height (2*2*8), but the transformed_solution incorrectly treats the calculation as if finding the perimeter of the base (2+2+2+2). By changing the formula from volume to perimeter, the result is an incorrect volume calculation, influencing the subsequent weight calculation in step 2. As a result, the original_solution's correct volume of 32 cubic meters used to find the weight (2700*32) is erroneously transformed to an incorrect volume of 8 cubic meters (2+2+2+2) and the subsequent incorrect weight (2700*8). It's important to note that only step 1 has been modified to introduce the confusing formula error, affecting the related step 2, while no language description has been changed.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "The marble statue has a volume of 2 m * 2 m * 8 m = 32 cubic meters.\nSo that means it has a weight of 2700 kg/m^3 * 32 m^3 = 86,400 kg.\n#### 86,400",
        "corrected_answer": 86400.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 1. Step 1 confuses the formula for the perimeter of the base with the formula for the volume of the rectangular prism. The volume should be calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height of the prism, which is 2 m * 2 m * 8 m = 32 cubic meters, not by adding the sides of the base. Step 2, as the subsequent step of step 1, references the wrong result of step 1, resulting in the incorrect final answer. The correct calculation for the weight is 2700 kg/m^3 * 32 m^3 = 86,400 kg."
