The surface area includes the walls and ceiling, not the floor, and should be calculated using the formula for area, not perimeter.

It then correctly adds 2 feet to each side of the length and width to find the new dimensions. Finally, it correctly multiplies the new length by the new width to find the new area. However, the explanation in the solution incorrectly states that the original width is being increased by 2 feet on each side, which would imply an increase in length, not width. The width is actually increased by 4 feet in total, not 2 feet. Despite this, the calculations are correct and the final answer is indeed 192 sq ft."
