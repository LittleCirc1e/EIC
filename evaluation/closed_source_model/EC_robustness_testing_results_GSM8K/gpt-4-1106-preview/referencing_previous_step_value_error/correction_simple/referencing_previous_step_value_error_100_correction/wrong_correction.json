The subsequent steps 6, 7, and 8 are affected by this error and calculate new and erroneous values for B, David, and Lily, but still follow the correct calculation process based on the incorrect value. It should be noted that step 3 in the transformed_solution <B + B/2 + 7 = 43> is the point where the referencing error occurs, while the equivalent step 3 in the original_solution <B + B + 7 = 43> and its result 2B = 36 should remain unchanged, ensuring the error occurs only at the point of reference and that all calculations following the erroneous reference are internally consistent and correct.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The equation setup in the original solution was incorrect. It should have been B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43, which simplifies to 3B + 7 = 43. After subtracting 7 from both sides, we get 3B = 36, and dividing both sides by 3 gives B = 12. The rest of the solution is correct, and Lily indeed found 13 insects."

Donna walks dogs for 2 hours every morning at $10.00 an hour, but only on weekdays (5 days), not all 7 days of the week. Therefore, the correct calculation for dog walking should be 5 days times $20.00 per day, which equals $100.00, not $140.00. The rest of the calculations are correct. Adding the correct amount for dog walking ($100.00) to the card shop earnings ($125.00) and babysitting earnings ($40.00) gives the correct total of $265.00."
