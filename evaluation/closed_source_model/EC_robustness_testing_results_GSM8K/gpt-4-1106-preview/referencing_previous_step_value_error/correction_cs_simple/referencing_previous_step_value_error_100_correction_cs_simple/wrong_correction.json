        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references B + B + 7 = 43 as B + B/2 + 7 = 43, changing 2B + 7 = 43 to 1.5B + 7 = 43 and as a result, changing the calculation in step 5 to 2B + B = 36 incorrectly. The subsequent steps 6, 7, and 8 are affected by this error and calculate new and erroneous values for B, David, and Lily, but still follow the correct calculation process based on the incorrect value. It should be noted that step 3 in the transformed_solution <B + B/2 + 7 = 43> is the point where the referencing error occurs, while the equivalent step 3 in the original_solution <B + B + 7 = 43> and its result 2B = 36 should remain unchanged, ensuring the error occurs only at the point of reference and that all calculations following the erroneous reference are internally consistent and correct.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The error occurred in the step where the equation was set up. It should be B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43, which simplifies to 2B + B = 36 after subtracting 7 from both sides. Then, dividing both sides by 3 gives B = 12. The rest of the solution is correct, and Lily found 13 insects."
