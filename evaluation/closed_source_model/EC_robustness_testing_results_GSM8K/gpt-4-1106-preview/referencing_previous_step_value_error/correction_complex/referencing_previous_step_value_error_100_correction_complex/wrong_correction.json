        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references B + B + 7 = 43 as B + B/2 + 7 = 43, changing 2B + 7 = 43 to 1.5B + 7 = 43 and as a result, changing the calculation in step 5 to 2B + B = 36 incorrectly. The subsequent steps 6, 7, and 8 are affected by this error and calculate new and erroneous values for B, David, and Lily, but still follow the correct calculation process based on the incorrect value. It should be noted that step 3 in the transformed_solution <B + B/2 + 7 = 43> is the point where the referencing error occurs, while the equivalent step 3 in the original_solution <B + B + 7 = 43> and its result 2B = 36 should remain unchanged, ensuring the error occurs only at the point of reference and that all calculations following the erroneous reference are internally consistent and correct.",

        "corrected_answer": 13.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The error in the solution is in the step where the equation is set up. It should be B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43, which simplifies to 2B + B = 43 - 7. This leads to 3B = 36, and when solved for B, we get B = 12. The rest of the solution is correct, and Lily indeed found 13 insects."

It should be noted that step 2 in the transformed_solution <So he drove for 300/75=4 hours> should be the same as the step 2 in the original_solution <So he drove for 300/75=4 hours> and calculates its result 4 correctly. The error only occurs in referencing the time spent at the museum, while the calculations of driving time remain correct. Subsequent steps are not affected since the 3rd step is the final one. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all steps is still correct, except for the incorrect reference of time spent at the museum.",

        "corrected_answer": 14.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the driving time as 4 hours for the round trip (2 hours each way). However, it incorrectly adds 8 hours instead of 6 hours for the time spent at the museum. The correct total time should be the sum of the driving time (4 hours) and the time spent at the museum (6 hours), which equals 10 hours, plus the return driving time of 4 hours, totaling 14 hours."
