        "question": "Emily wants to know how much it rained last week. She sees that it rained 2 inches on Monday morning and 1 more inch later that day. It rained twice that much on Tuesday. It did not rain on Wednesday but on Thursday it rained 1 inch. The biggest storm was on Friday when the total was equal to Monday through Thursday combined. What was the daily average rain total for the week?",
        "original_solution": "The total rain was 2 inches + 1 inches = 3 inches on Monday.\nThe total rain was 2 * 3 inches = 6 inches on Tuesday.\nThe total rain was 0 inches + 1 inch = 1 inch across Wednesday and Thursday.\nThe total rain was 3 inches + 6 inches + 1 inch = 10 inches on Friday.\nThere were 3 inches + 6 inches + 1 inch + 10 inches = 20 inches total last week.\n20 inches/5 days = 4 inches average daily rain.\n#### 4",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 5 incorrectly counts the number of days. In the transformed_solution, the divisor has been mistakenly changed from 5 days to 4 days (Monday to Thursday), excluding Friday. This incorrect counting affects step 6, changing the average daily rain calculation from 20/5=4 inches to 20/4=5 inches, thus leading to a different transformed_answer.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "The total rain was 2 inches + 1 inch = 3 inches on Monday.\nThe total rain was 2 * 3 inches = 6 inches on Tuesday.\nThe total rain was 0 inches on Wednesday.\nThe total rain was 1 inch on Thursday.\nThe total rain was 3 inches + 6 inches + 1 inch + 1 inch = 11 inches on Friday.\nThere were 3 inches + 6 inches + 0 inches + 1 inch + 11 inches = 21 inches total from Monday to Friday.\n21 inches/7 days = 3 inches average daily rain.",
        "corrected_answer": 3.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly combined Wednesday and Thursday's rain totals and then incorrectly calculated the total rain for Friday. The correct total for Friday is the sum of Monday through Thursday, which is 3 inches (Monday) + 6 inches (Tuesday) + 0 inches (Wednesday) + 1 inch (Thursday) = 11 inches. The total for the week is 3 inches (Monday) + 6 inches (Tuesday) + 0 inches (Wednesday) + 1 inch (Thursday) + 11 inches (Friday) = 21 inches. To find the average daily rain, divide the total inches of rain by the number of days in the week, which is 7, not 4. Therefore, the average daily rain is 21 inches / 7 days = 3 inches."
