        "question": "Emily wants to know how much it rained last week. She sees that it rained 2 inches on Monday morning and 1 more inch later that day. It rained twice that much on Tuesday. It did not rain on Wednesday but on Thursday it rained 1 inch. The biggest storm was on Friday when the total was equal to Monday through Thursday combined. What was the daily average rain total for the week?",
        "original_solution": "The total rain was 2 inches + 1 inches = 3 inches on Monday.\nThe total rain was 2 * 3 inches = 6 inches on Tuesday.\nThe total rain was 0 inches + 1 inch = 1 inch across Wednesday and Thursday.\nThe total rain was 3 inches + 6 inches + 1 inch = 10 inches on Friday.\nThere were 3 inches + 6 inches + 1 inch + 10 inches = 20 inches total last week.\n20 inches/5 days = 4 inches average daily rain.\n#### 4",
        "original_answer": 4,
        "transformed_solution": "The total rain was 2 inches + 1 inches = 3 inches on Monday.\nThe total rain was 2 * 3 inches = 6 inches on Tuesday.\nThe total rain was 0 inches + 1 inch = 1 inch across Wednesday and Thursday.\nThe total rain was 3 inches + 6 inches + 1 inch = 10 inches on Friday.\nThere were 3 inches + 6 inches + 1 inch + 10 inches = 20 inches total from Monday to Thursday.\n20 inches/4 days = 5 inches average daily rain.\n#### 5",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 5 incorrectly counts the number of days. In the transformed_solution, the divisor has been mistakenly changed from 5 days to 4 days (Monday to Thursday), excluding Friday. This incorrect counting affects step 6, changing the average daily rain calculation from 20/5=4 inches to 20/4=5 inches, thus leading to a different transformed_answer.",

        "corrected_solution": "The total rain was 2 inches + 1 inch = 3 inches on Monday.\nThe total rain was 2 * 2 inches = 4 inches on Tuesday.\nIt did not rain on Wednesday.\nThe total rain was 1 inch on Thursday.\nThe total rain was 3 inches + 4 inches + 0 inches + 1 inch = 8 inches on Friday.\nThere were 3 inches + 4 inches + 0 inches + 1 inch + 8 inches = 16 inches total from Monday to Friday.\n16 inches/5 days = 3.2 inches average daily rain.\n#### 3.2",
        "corrected_answer": 3.2,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly calculates the total rain for Tuesday as twice 3 inches instead of twice 2 inches, which should be 4 inches. It also incorrectly adds the total for Wednesday and Thursday, which should be 0 inches for Wednesday and 1 inch for Thursday, not combined. The total for Friday is also incorrectly calculated; it should be the sum of Monday through Thursday, which is 8 inches, not 10 inches. Finally, the total rain for the week is incorrectly summed up as 20 inches instead of the correct 16 inches, and the average is calculated over 4 days instead of 5. The correct average daily rain is 16 inches divided by 5 days, which equals 3.2 inches."

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly calculates the total rain on Tuesday as twice 3 inches instead of twice 2 inches, which should be 4 inches. It also incorrectly calculates the total rain on Friday by adding Monday through Thursday's rain incorrectly. The correct total for Friday is 3 inches (Monday) + 4 inches (Tuesday) + 0 inches (Wednesday) + 1 inch (Thursday) = 8 inches. The total rain for the week is 3 inches (Monday) + 4 inches (Tuesday) + 0 inches (Wednesday) + 1 inch (Thursday) + 8 inches (Friday) = 16 inches. The average daily rain should be calculated over 7 days, not 4 days. Therefore, the average is 16 inches divided by 7 days, which equals approximately 2.2857 inches, rounded to two decimal places is 2.29 inches."
