        "question": "An organization trying to save endangered species of turtles has taken twice more hawksbill turtles than the number of green turtles into a conservation center. If the number of green turtles is 800, calculate the number of turtles that have been taken into the conservation center.",
        "original_solution": "If the number of hawksbill turtles is twice more than the number of green turtles, then there are 2*800 = 1600 more hawksbill turtles.\nThe total number of hawksbill turtles is 800+1600 = 2400\nThe total number of turtles that have been taken into the conservation center is 2400+800 = 3200 turtles.\n#### 3200",
        "original_answer": 3200.0,
        "transformed_solution": "If the number of hawksbill turtles is twice more than the number of green turtles, then there are 2*800 = 1600 more hawksbill turtles.\nAdditional loggerhead turtles equal to half the number of green turtles were also taken in, so there are 800/2 = 400 loggerhead turtles.\nThe total number of hawksbill turtles is 800+1600 = 2400\nThe total number of turtles that have been taken into the conservation center is 2400+800+400 = 3600 turtles.\n#### 3600",

        "wrong_type": "adding_irrelevant_information",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 2 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <Additional loggerhead turtles equal to half the number of green turtles were also taken in>, resulting in step 2 changing from calculating only hawksbill and green turtles to also including loggerhead turtles in the transformed_solution. The new step integrated is 800/2 = 400 loggerhead turtles, which is then added to the total count, changing the answer from 3200 turtles to 3600 turtles.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "If the number of hawksbill turtles is twice more than the number of green turtles, then there are 2*800 = 1600 hawksbill turtles.\nThe total number of turtles that have been taken into the conservation center is 1600+800 = 2400 turtles.",
        "corrected_answer": 2400.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly adds an additional 800 to the number of hawksbill turtles. 'Twice more' means two times the number, not two times plus the original number. Therefore, the correct number of hawksbill turtles is 1600, and the total number of turtles is 2400."
