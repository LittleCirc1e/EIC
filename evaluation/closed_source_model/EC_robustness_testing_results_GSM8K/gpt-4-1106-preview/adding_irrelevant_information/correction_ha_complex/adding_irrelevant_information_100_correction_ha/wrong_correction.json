        "original_solution": "If there are 60 black bears in the park and 40 more brown bears than black bears, there are 60+40 = 100 brown bears.\nThe number of black and brown bears in the park is 100+60 = 160\nTwice the number of black bears as white bears means 60/2 = 30 white bears.\nThe population of bears in the national park is 30+160 = 190\n#### 190",
