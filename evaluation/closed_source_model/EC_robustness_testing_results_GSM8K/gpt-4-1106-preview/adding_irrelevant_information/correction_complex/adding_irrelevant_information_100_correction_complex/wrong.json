        "original_solution": "He gains 120*.2=24 kg in muscles\nSo he gains 24/4=6 kg of fat\nThat means he gains a total of 24+6=30 kg of bodyweight\nSo his new body weight is 120+30=150 kg\n#### 150",
        "original_answer": 150.0,
        "transformed_solution": "He gains 120*.2=24 kg in muscles\nSo he gains 24/4=6 kg of fat\nBecause he also drank a weight gain supplement that added an extra 5 kg, that means he gains a total of 24+6+5=35 kg of bodyweight\nSo his new body weight is 120+35=155 kg\n#### 155",

        "explanation": "Step 3 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <Because he also drank a weight gain supplement that added an extra 5 kg>, resulting in step 3 changing from 24+6=30 kg of bodyweight in the original_solution to 24+6+5=35 kg of bodyweight in the transformed_solution. The language description has also changed from <That means he gains a total of 24+6=30 kg of bodyweight> to <that means he gains a total of 24+6+5=35 kg of bodyweight>.

        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the weight gained in muscle by multiplying the original weight by 20%, which is 24 kg. It then correctly calculates the weight gained in fat as a quarter of the muscle gain, which is 6 kg. The solution adds an extra 5 kg for the weight gain supplement. Finally, it adds the original weight to the total weight gained (muscle, fat, and supplement) to find the new body weight, which is 155 kg. The arithmetic and the process are correct."

        "original_solution": "The first 3 pieces each cost 45000/3=$15,000\nSo the next piece was 15,000*.5=$7,500 more expensive\nThat means it cost 15,000+7,500=$22,500\nThat means in total he spent 45,000+22,500=$67,500\n#### 67,500",

It then correctly calculates the additional cost of the next piece of art as 50% of the price of one of the first three pieces. It adds the cost of the frame to the price of the fourth piece of art to find its total cost. Finally, it adds the total cost of the first three pieces to the total cost of the fourth piece to find the overall cost. The arithmetic is correct, and the final answer is correct."
