        "corrected_explanation": "Step 1 first makes an error in referencing the number of knives Carolyn has after the trade. The solution incorrectly adds 10 knives instead of subtracting them, which would result in Carolyn having a negative number of knives, which is not possible. Therefore, she has 0 knives after the trade. This affects subsequent steps that reference the number of knives. The corrected calculation should subtract the 10 knives she trades away from the initial 6 knives, resulting in 0 knives. The total amount of silverware is then 24 spoons + 0 knives + 12 forks = 36 pieces, and the percentage of knives is 0/36 * 100% = 0%."
