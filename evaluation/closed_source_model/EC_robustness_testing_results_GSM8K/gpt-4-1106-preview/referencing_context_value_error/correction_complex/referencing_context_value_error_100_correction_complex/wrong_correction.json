        "explanation": "Step 2 erroneously references 10 in the original solution as 15, which leads to the calculation of 15 x 2 = 30 instead of the correct 10 x 2 = 20. All the subsequent steps (3 and 4) are affected by the erroneous result of step 2 but are calculated correctly based on that result. In step 3 the number 10 + 30 = 40 is correct in context to the previous error and in step 4, 75 - 40 = 35 is correct following from the affected step 3. Step 1 is correct and steps that reference the numbers from the question in other steps still reference them correctly except for step 2 where the error occurs.",

        "corrected_explanation": "Step 2 makes a mistake in calculating the swimming speed. It should be 1 mile per 20 minutes, which is 1/20 mile per minute. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the speed in mph is 1/(20/60) = 3 miles per hour. The rowing speed is twice the swimming speed, so it should be 3*2 = 6 mph. The correct time to row around the lake is then 60/6 = 10 hours."
