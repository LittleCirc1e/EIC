        "original_solution": "Josh practices soccer 2 hours x 3 days = 6 hours.\nHe practices band 1.5 hours x 2 days = 3 hours.\nFrom Monday to Friday, on extracurricular activities, Josh spends 6 + 3 = 9 hours.\n#### 9",

This error affects the final step as well, changing the total number of hours Josh spends from 9 to 11 hours. The counting result in this step is the only error, and the rest of the calculation is correctly performed based on this mistake.",
