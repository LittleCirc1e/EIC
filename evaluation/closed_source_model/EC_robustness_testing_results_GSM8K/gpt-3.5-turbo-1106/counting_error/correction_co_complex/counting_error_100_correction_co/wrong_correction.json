        "question": "Bobby buys two packets of candy. He eats two candies every day from Monday through Friday and takes one each during the remaining days of the week. If it takes him 3 such weeks to finish the 2 packets, how many candies are in a packet?",
        "original_solution": "He eats 2 each from Monday through Friday for a total of 2*5 = 10 candies\nHe eats 1 each every other day of the week (Saturday and Sunday) for a total of 1*2 = 2 candies\nIn a week, he consumes a total of 10+2 = 12 candies\nDoing this for 3 weeks, he will consume 3*12 = 36 candies\nIf 2 packets contain 36 candies, then 1 contains 36/2 = 18 candies\n#### 18",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 erroneously counts the remaining days of the week as one day (Sunday only) instead of two days (Saturday and Sunday), resulting in 1*2=2 becoming 1*1=1. And it affects the subsequent related steps, step 3 changes from 10+2=12 to 10+1=11, step 4 changes from 3*12=36 to 3*11=33, and step 5 changes from 36/2=18 to 33/2=16.5.

It did not rain on Wednesday but on Thursday it rained 1 inch. The biggest storm was on Friday when the total was equal to Monday through Thursday combined.
