        "question": "Bobby buys two packets of candy. He eats two candies every day from Monday through Friday and takes one each during the remaining days of the week. If it takes him 3 such weeks to finish the 2 packets, how many candies are in a packet?",
        "original_solution": "He eats 2 each from Monday through Friday for a total of 2*5 = 10 candies\nHe eats 1 each every other day of the week (Saturday and Sunday) for a total of 1*2 = 2 candies\nIn a week, he consumes a total of 10+2 = 12 candies\nDoing this for 3 weeks, he will consume 3*12 = 36 candies\nIf 2 packets contain 36 candies, then 1 contains 36/2 = 18 candies\n#### 18",
        "original_answer": 18,

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 erroneously counts the remaining days of the week as one day (Sunday only) instead of two days (Saturday and Sunday), resulting in 1*2=2 becoming 1*1=1. And it affects the subsequent related steps, step 3 changes from 10+2=12 to 10+1=11, step 4 changes from 3*12=36 to 3*11=33, and step 5 changes from 36/2=18 to 33/2=16.5.

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution is incorrect because it assumes that a packet contains 16.5 candies, which is not possible. The correct calculation should be 33/3 = 11 candies per week, and since he eats 2 packets in 3 weeks, the total number of candies in 2 packets is 11*3*2 = 66."

This change affects the number of candies eaten in the week (step 3) and the total number of weeks it takes for Lisa to eat all the candies (step 4), changing it from 36 / 9 = 4 weeks to 36 / 8 = 4.5 weeks.
