        "question": "Josh has soccer practice on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. He has band practice on Tuesday and Thursday from 3:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. From Monday to Friday, how many hours does Josh spend on extracurricular activities?",
        "original_solution": "Josh practices soccer 2 hours x 3 days = 6 hours.\nHe practices band 1.5 hours x 2 days = 3 hours.\nFrom Monday to Friday, on extracurricular activities, Josh spends 6 + 3 = 9 hours.\n#### 9",
        "original_answer": 9.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Josh practices soccer 2 hours x 4 days = 8 hours.\nHe practices band 1.5 hours x 2 days = 3 hours.\nFrom Monday to Friday, on extracurricular activities, Josh spends 8 + 3 = 11 hours.\n#### 11",

        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In the transformed_solution, step 1 incorrectly counts soccer practice as happening for 4 days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and one additional incorrect day) instead of 3 days, resulting in 2 hours x 4 days = 8 hours instead of the correct 2 hours x 3 days = 6 hours. This error affects the final step as well, changing the total number of hours Josh spends from 9 to 11 hours. The counting result in this step is the only error, and the rest of the calculation is correctly performed based on this mistake.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Josh practices soccer 2 hours x 3 days = 6 hours.\nHe practices band 1.5 hours x 2 days = 3 hours.\nFrom Monday to Friday, on extracurricular activities, Josh spends 6 + 3 = 9 hours.",
        "corrected_answer": 9,
        "corrected_explanation": "The mistake occurred in the first step where the number of days for soccer practice was counted as 4 instead of 3, leading to an incorrect total hours. The corrected solution adjusts the number of days for soccer practice and recalculates the total hours spent on extracurricular activities."
