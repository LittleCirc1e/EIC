On each of Wednesday and Thursday, twice the number of cars that passed through the toll booth on Monday went through the toll booth. If, for the remaining of the days of the week, an equal number of vehicles passed through the toll booth, calculate the total number of cars that passed the toll both in each of the remaining days.",
        "original_solution": "There were 50+50 = 100 cars that went through the toll booth on Monday and Tuesday.\nOn Wednesday, the number of cars that went through the toll booth is 2*50 = 100.\nThe exact number of cars passed through the toll booth on Thursday as Wednesday, giving a total of 100+100 = 200 vehicles going through the toll booth in the two days.\nThere were 200+100 = 300 cars that passed through the toll booth from Monday to Thursday.\nIf the total number of cars passed through the toll booth in the week was 450, then 450-300 = 150 vehicles went through the toll booth on the remaining days.\nSince there were an equal number of cars in the toll booth on each of the remaining days, there were 150/3 = 50 cars on each day.\n#### 50",

        "explanation": "In the wrong_step (step 6), the number of remaining days in the week should be 3 (Friday, Saturday, Sunday), but it has been incorrectly assumed to be 2 in the transformed_solution. Therefore, the calculation of 150/3 in the original_solution has been erroneously transformed to 150/2. The division operation is correctly performed, but the number of days (the divisor) is a counting error, resulting in a different transformed_answer.",

        "question": "Zainab earns $2 an hour passing out flyers at the town square. She passes out flyers on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday each week, for 4 hours at a time. After passing out flyers for 4 weeks, how much money will Zainab earn?",
        "original_solution": "Every day Zainab passes out flyers, she earns $2 x 4 = $8\nIf she hands out flyers for 3 days, she'll earn $8/day * 3 days = $24\nIf she passes out flyers for 4 weeks, she will earn $24 * 4 = $96\n#### 96",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 mistakenly counts the number of days Zainab passes out flyers as 2 days instead of 3 days per week, resulting in the original calculation of $8/day * 3 days = $24 being changed to $8/day * 2 days = $16 in the transformed_solution. Subsequently, the error affects step 3, changing the final calculation from $24 * 4 = $96 to $16 * 4 = $64. The initial earning calculation for a single day remains unaffected by the counting error, and only the subsequent steps that rely on the number of days are impacted.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The error occurred in the second step, where it states that Zainab earns $8/day * 2 days = $16. The mistake is in counting the total number of days she passes out flyers. The correct calculation should be $8/day * 3 days = $24 for each week. So, for 4 weeks, the correct answer is $24 * 4 = $96."
