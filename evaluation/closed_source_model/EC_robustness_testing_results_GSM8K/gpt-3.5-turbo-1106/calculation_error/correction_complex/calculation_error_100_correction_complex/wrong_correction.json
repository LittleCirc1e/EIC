        "question": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2% today. The Dow ended the day at 8,722. What was the Dow in the morning before the markets opened?",
        "original_solution": "Today the Dow was down 8722 / 98*2 = 178.\nSo it started at 8722 + 178 = 8900.\n#### 8900",
        "original_answer": 8900.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Today the Dow was down 8722 / 98*2 = 188.\nSo it started at 8722 + 188 = 8910.\n#### 8910",

        "explanation": "The transformed_solution shows an intentional wrong calculation of the first step: '8722 / 98*2 = 188' instead of the correct '8722 / 98*2 = 178'. The mistake in the first step carries over to the second step '8722 + 188 = 8910' to maintain the inherited error. The subsequent step is affected by using the erroneous result of 188; however, this step is still calculated correctly based on the new wrong input. The original step is '8722 + 178 = 8900', and the transformed solution alters the outcome to '8722 + 188 = 8910'. The transformed answer is therefore 8910, which is different from the original answer of 8900. This simulates a single miscalculation without changing any operands or operators in the formula.",

The subsequent step 2 references the result of step 1, calculating 8722 + 188 = 8910 instead of 8722 + 174.44 = 8896.44, resulting in the final incorrect answer."

The modified formula in step 5 becomes 25 - 11 = 14 instead of 25 - 13 = 12. Step 6 and step 7 remain unaffected as they do not rely on the result of step 4 or step 5. As a result, the error is confined to step 4's calculation and its immediate consequence on step 5, leaving all other steps and their calculations as correct. In step 7, the number of boxes of cookies is inaccurately calculated based on the mistaken $14 value, yielding 14 / 6 = 2.33 boxes of cookies.",
