        "original_solution": "He gains 120*.2=24 kg in muscles\nSo he gains 24/4=6 kg of fat\nThat means he gains a total of 24+6=30 kg of bodyweight\nSo his new body weight is 120+30=150 kg\n#### 150",

        "transformed_solution": "He gains 120*.2=24 kg in muscles\nSo he gains 24/4=6 kg of fat\nBecause he also drank a weight gain supplement that added an extra 5 kg, that means he gains a total of 24+6+5=35 kg of bodyweight\nSo his new body weight is 120+35=155 kg\n#### 155",

The language description has also changed from <That means he gains a total of 24+6=30 kg of bodyweight> to <that means he gains a total of 24+6+5=35 kg of bodyweight>.
