This leads to the erroneous assumption that the discount for 3 gallons of milk would be $3 without properly calculating. The modification of step 2 should have been from $1/gallon x 3 gallons = $3 to $3/gallon x 3 gallons = $9. Instead, the original $3 from step 2 is kept, which does not reflect the deletion of step 1. The total would then be incorrectly calculated in step 2 as $3 + $5 = $8, leading to an incorrect total discount of $8 instead of the correct $11, which is the result of $9 for milk plus $5 for cereal.

The correct intermediate calculation of the weight difference was not considered, resulting in the number of needed rocks being artificially increased to 15.
