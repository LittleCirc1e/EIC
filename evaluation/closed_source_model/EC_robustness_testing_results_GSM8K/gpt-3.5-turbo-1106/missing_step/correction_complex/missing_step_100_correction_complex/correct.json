This leads to step 1 of the transformed_solution, which originally computed Tracy and Jake's combined weight using Jake's actual weight, to instead double Tracy's weight (thus stepping away from the +8). As a result, Tracy and Jake's combined weight is incorrectly listed as 52+52 kg, and the remaining steps are updated accordingly to keep consistency.
