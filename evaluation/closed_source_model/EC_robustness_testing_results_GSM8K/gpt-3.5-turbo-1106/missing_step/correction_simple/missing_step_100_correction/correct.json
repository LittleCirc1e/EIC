        "explanation": "In this example, the first intermediate step, which calculates the discount for each gallon of whole milk, has been deleted. In the original_solution, step 1 provides the discount per gallon of milk, which is then used in step 2. With the deletion of step 1, the correct discount of $1 per gallon is no longer applied to the 3 gallons of milk. Instead, the number from the question, which is the largest number referenced in the deleted step 1, should be used for the subsequent related steps. This leads to the erroneous assumption that the discount for 3 gallons of milk would be $3 without properly calculating. The modification of step 2 should have been from $1/gallon x 3 gallons = $3 to $3/gallon x 3 gallons = $9. Instead, the original $3 from step 2 is kept, which does not reflect the deletion of step 1. The total would then be incorrectly calculated in step 2 as $3 + $5 = $8, leading to an incorrect total discount of $8 instead of the correct $11, which is the result of $9 for milk plus $5 for cereal. Thus, the transformed_answer should be $11, but remains erroneously as $8.

Therefore, after deleting step 3, step 4 should reference the result 30 from step 2 and change the formula from 30 + 40 = 70 to 100 - 30 = 70. The deletion of the intermediate step also leads to recalculating the number of pages used in step 5 by subtracting from the total number of pages instead of adding the numbers from step 2. This leads to 30 - 10 = 20 pages used. Finally, the number of photos that can be placed on the remaining pages (step 6) changes from 30 divided by 10 to 70 divided by 20, resulting in an answer of 3.5 photos per page.
