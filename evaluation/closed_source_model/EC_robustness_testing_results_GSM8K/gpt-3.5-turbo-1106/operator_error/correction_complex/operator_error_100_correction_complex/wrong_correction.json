Step 3 changes from 120/60=2 hours to 3.333/60=0.05555 hours, and step 4 changes from 2/2=1 hour to 0.05555/2=0.027775 hour. It should be noted that only the operator in step 2 is incorrect, but its calculation is correct, which leads to its result being incorrect. This affects the subsequent steps of using its results, but all the calculation of the steps affected by step 2 is correct.",

        "explanation": "This example modifies the division operator to a multiplication operator in step 1 of the solution, changing from 60/3=20 to 60*3=180. The change affects only the outcome of this first step, making the erroneous assumption that Atticus, Jensen, and Cruz have 180 marbles together. Steps 2 and 3 are unchanged and remain correct as they are self-contained. In step 4, we incorrectly use the new total of 180 marbles to calculate the number of marbles Cruz has, which results in an incorrect answer of 168 marbles instead of the correct 8. The error is due to the incorrect operator in step 1, but the calculations in each of the steps are performed correctly according to the changed operator.",
