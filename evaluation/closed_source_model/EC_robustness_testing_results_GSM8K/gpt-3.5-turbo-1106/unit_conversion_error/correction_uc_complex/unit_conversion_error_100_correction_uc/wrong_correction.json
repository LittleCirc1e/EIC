        "original_solution": "There are 10 tiles that are 6 inches long running the width of the bathroom so it is 10*6 = 60 inches long\nThere are 12 inches in a foot and it’s 60 inches wide so it is 60/12 = 5 feet wide\nThere are 20 tiles that are 6 inches long running the length of the bathroom so it’s 20*6 = 120 inches long\nThere are 12 inches in a foot and it’s 120 inches long so it is 120/12 = 10 feet wide\nThe square footage is l x w so the bathroom has 10*5 = 50 sq feet\n#### 50",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 introduces an incorrect unit conversion, asserting that there are 10 inches in a foot instead of 12 inches. This mistake affects the width calculation of the bathroom, which transforms from 60 inches wide equals to 5 feet wide (60/12) in the original_solution to 60 inches wide equals to 6 feet wide (60/10) in the transformed_solution. Consequently, the square footage calculation in the final step is also impacted, changing from 50 sq feet (10*5) in the original_solution to 60 sq feet (10*6) in the transformed_solution. All other calculation steps remain accurate.",

And it affects the subsequent related step 4, where the total time changes from 3+1 = 4 hours to 3+1.2 = 4.2 hours, and the final step 5 where the latest time the head baker can show up changes from 6-4 = 2:00 am to approximately 6-4.2 = 1:48 am (converted from decimal to time format).
