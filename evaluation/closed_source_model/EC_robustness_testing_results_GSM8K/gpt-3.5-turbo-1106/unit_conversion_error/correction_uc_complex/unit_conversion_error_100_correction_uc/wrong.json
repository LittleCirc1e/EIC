How much time will Mrs. Parker have to use the bathroom to leave on time?",
        "original_solution": "Between 2:30 pm and 5:00 pm, there are 2.5 hours.\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2.5 hours x 60 = 150 minutes.\nHer family was in the bathroom 45 + 30 + 20 = 95 minutes.\nMrs. Parker has 150 minutes – 95 minutes = 55 minutes in the bathroom.\n#### 55",

His car gets 18 miles per gallon of gas, and his gas indicator comes on when he's used 15 gallons, at which point he stops to refill, which takes 10 minutes.

        "explanation": "In this transformed solution, an incorrect unit conversion is made in step 1, which assumes that 1 hour has 50 minutes instead of the correct 60 minutes. This results in the calculation of driving time changing from 12 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 720 minutes in the original solution to 12 hours * 50 minutes per hour = 600 minutes in the transformed solution. Subsequent related steps concerning the total time taken, including rest stops and refueling, are all correctly calculated based on this initial error, leading to a different final answer of 695 minutes as compared to the original answer of 815 minutes. The error is limited to the initial unit conversion, subsequent calculations that hinge on this error are correct, which aligns with the requirement for a single error change.",
