How much time will Mrs. Parker have to use the bathroom to leave on time?",
        "original_solution": "Between 2:30 pm and 5:00 pm, there are 2.5 hours.\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2.5 hours x 60 = 150 minutes.\nHer family was in the bathroom 45 + 30 + 20 = 95 minutes.\nMrs. Parker has 150 minutes – 95 minutes = 55 minutes in the bathroom.\n#### 55",

And it affects the subsequent related step 4, which changes from Mrs. Parker having 150 minutes – 95 minutes = 55 minutes to use the bathroom to Mrs. Parker having 125 minutes – 95 minutes = 30 minutes to use the bathroom.

How much time will Mrs. Parker have to use the bathroom to leave on time?",
        "original_solution": "Between 2:30 pm and 5:00 pm, there are 2.5 hours.\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2.5 hours x 60 = 150 minutes.\nHer family was in the bathroom 45 + 30 + 20 = 95 minutes.\nMrs. Parker has 150 minutes – 95 minutes = 55 minutes in the bathroom.\n#### 55",
