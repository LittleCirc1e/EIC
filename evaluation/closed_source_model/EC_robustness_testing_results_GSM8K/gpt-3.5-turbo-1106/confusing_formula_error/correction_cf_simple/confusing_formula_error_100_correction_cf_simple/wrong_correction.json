        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and area of rectangle. The question requires that the perimeter of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the sum of twice its length and twice its width, rather than the length multiplied by the width, which is equivalent to the area of the rectangle, resulting in 2 * 225 + 2 * 125 = 700 feet in the original_solution being changed to 225 * 125 = 28125 square feet in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 2, changing from 700 - 3 - 10 = 687 feet to 28125 - 3 - 10 = 28112 feet. Note that the language description of step 1 < The perimeter of the garden is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 1 mistakenly uses the formula of rectangular area, while the other calculation processes are still correct.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "The perimeter of the garden is 2 * (225 + 125) = 700 feet. Then add the length of the two gates, so the total fencing needed is 700 + 3 + 10 = 713 feet.",
        "corrected_answer": "713.0",
        "corrected_explanation": "The original solution incorrectly calculated the area of the garden instead of the perimeter, and also subtracted the width of the gates instead of adding them to the total fencing needed."
