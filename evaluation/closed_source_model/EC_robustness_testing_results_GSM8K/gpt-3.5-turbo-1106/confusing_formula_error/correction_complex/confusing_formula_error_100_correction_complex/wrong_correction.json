        "question": "The building has 42 storage units that are a total of 5040 square feet. Twenty of the units are 8 by 4 feet each. If the remaining units are all the same size, what is the area, in square feet, for one of the remaining units?",
        "original_solution": "8 * 4 = 32 square feet\n20 * 32 = 640 square feet\n5040 - 640 = 4400 square feet\nThere are 42 - 20 = 22 remaining units\n4400/22 = 200 square feet\nOne of the remaining units is 200 square feet.\n#### 200",
        "original_answer": 200.0,
        "transformed_solution": "8 + 4 + 8 + 4 = 24 square feet\n20 * 24 = 480 square feet\n5040 - 480 = 4560 square feet\nThere are 42 - 20 = 22 remaining units\n4560/22 = 207.27 square feet\nOne of the remaining units is 207.27 square feet.\n#### 207.27",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the area with perimeter. The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width, not the sum of all sides, which is equivalent to the perimeter. This changes the solution from \"8 * 4 = 32 square feet\" in the original_solution to \"8 + 4 + 8 + 4 = 24 square feet\" in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 2, where the calculation changes from \"20 * 32 = 640 square feet\" to \"20 * 24 = 480 square feet\". The subsequent steps carry the error forward, altering the final answer. Note that only step 1 erroneously uses the perimeter formula, while the other calculation processes follow correctly.",

        "corrected_explanation": "Step 3 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 5040-480=4560 instead of 5040-480=4560. The subsequent step 5 references the result of step 3, calculating 4560/22=207.27 instead of 4560/22=207.27, resulting in the final incorrect answer."

        "question": "Mary is building a mosaic for her school cafeteria's wall. It will be 10 feet tall and 15 feet long. Each tile she uses is 1 inch square. How many tiles will she need?",
        "original_solution": "First convert the length of the mural to inches: 15 feet * 12 inches/foot = 180 inches\nThen convert the height of the mural to inches: 10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches\nThen multiply the length and the height to find the total area of the mural: 180 inches * 120 inches = 21600 square inches. Since each tile is 1 square inch, this is also the number of tiles she needs.\n#### 21600",
        "original_answer": 21600.0,
        "transformed_solution": "First convert the length of the mural to inches: 15 feet * 12 inches/foot = 180 inches\nThen convert the height of the mural to inches: 10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches\nThen add the length and height to find the total perimeter of the mural: 180 inches + 120 inches = 300 inches. Since we are calculating perimeter instead of area in this step, this will give us a different number of tiles. However, for each tile being 1 square inch, this step is incorrect for determining the number of tiles she needs.\n#### 300",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the perimeter and area of a rectangle. The question requires that the total area of the mural to be solved, which would be the length multiplied by the height. Instead, the length and height are added together, which would calculate the perimeter if the width were also a part of the calculation, resulting in 180 inches * 120 inches = 21600 square inches in the original_solution becoming 180 inches + 120 inches = 300 inches in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent understanding of the result as the number of tiles needed by Mary, changing from 21600 tiles to an incorrect 300 tiles based on perimeter rather than area. Note that the language descriptions of the steps in the original_solution remain unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 3 mistakenly uses the addition suitable for calculating perimeter instead of the multiplication required for area, while the other calculation processes are still correct, although they are now based on an incorrect transformed_step.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "To find the number of tiles needed, we need to calculate the total area of the mural. The area is calculated by multiplying the length by the height: 15 feet * 12 inches/foot * 10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1800 square inches. Since each tile is 1 square inch, Mary will need 1800 tiles.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The original solution incorrectly calculates the perimeter of the mural instead of the area, resulting in the incorrect number of tiles needed."
