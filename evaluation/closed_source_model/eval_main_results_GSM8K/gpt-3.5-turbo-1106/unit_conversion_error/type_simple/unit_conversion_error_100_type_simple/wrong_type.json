        "original_solution": "We need to count the sequences that Tobias made, which consist of 25 minutes of swimming and a 5-minute pause, so one sequence lasts for 25 minutes + 5 minutes = 30 minutes/sequence.\nThree hours is 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes, so he is able to make 180 minutes / 30 minutes/sequence = 6 sequences.\nTherefore Tobias needs to make 6 pauses within these 6 sequences, which will last for 6 pauses * 5 minutes/pause = 30 minutes.\nDuring three hours, he is going to swim for 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes.\nTherefore Tobias can make 100 meters for 150 minutes / 5 minutes/100 meters = 30 times.\nSo he was able to swim 30 times * 100 meters/time = 3000 meters in total.\n#### 3000",
