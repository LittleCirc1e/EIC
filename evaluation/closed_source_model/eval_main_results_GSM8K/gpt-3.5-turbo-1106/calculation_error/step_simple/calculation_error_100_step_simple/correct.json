This is a calculation error because the multiplication involved a correct value ($1.50) but produced an incorrect result ($148 instead of $150). All previous steps are unaffected as they remain accurate and the error only appears in the last step, so the entire process prior to it does not inherit the error, thus making the error a single and isolated one in step 4.",
