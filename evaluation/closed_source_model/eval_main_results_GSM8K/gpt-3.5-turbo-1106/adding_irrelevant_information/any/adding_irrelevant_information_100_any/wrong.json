        "question": "Micah bought envelopes to send, and depending on the weight of the envelope he will need more stamps. If an envelope weighs more than 5 pounds, he will need 5 stamps. If it weighs less than that, it will only need 2 stamps. If he bought 52 stamps with 6 envelopes that weigh less than 5 pounds, how many envelopes in total did Micah need to buy?",
        "original_solution": "Micah had to buy 6*2=12 stamps for 6 envelopes less than 5 pounds.\nHe has 52-12=40 more stamps to buy.\nThere are 40/5=8 envelopes that weigh more than 5 pounds.\nMicah needed to buy 8+6=14 envelopes.\n#### 14",
        "original_answer": 14.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Micah had to buy 6*2=12 stamps for 6 envelopes less than 5 pounds.\nHe has 52-12=40 more stamps to buy.\nBecause he also bought 10 stamps for international envelopes, there are (40-10)/5=6 envelopes that weigh more than 5 pounds.\nMicah needed to buy 6+6=12 envelopes.\n#### 12",

        "wrong_type": "adding_irrelevant_information",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 3 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <Because he also bought 10 stamps for international envelopes>, resulting in step 3 changing from 40/5=8 to (40-10)/5=6 in the transformed_solution. Consequently, the final result changes from Micah needing to buy 8+6=14 envelopes to 6+6=12 envelopes. It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the number of stamps needed for envelopes less than 5 pounds, then subtracts that from the total number of stamps bought to find the number of stamps needed for envelopes more than 5 pounds. Adding the number of international stamps and dividing by 5 gives the number of envelopes more than 5 pounds. Adding the number of envelopes less than 5 pounds gives the total number of envelopes Micah needed to buy, which is 12."
