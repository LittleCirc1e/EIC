        "explanation": "Here, step 1 has been removed. In the original_solution, step 1 calculates the number of orange marbles, and step 2 calculates the number of purple marbles using the result of step 1. After deleting step 1, the calculation of the number of purple marbles directly references the number of pink marbles subtracting the 9 marbles. However, the correct process is to find the number of orange marbles first before calculating the number of purple marbles as 4 times the orange marbles. The subsequent step also changes: it no longer includes orange marbles in the total count, making the formula change from 13+4+16=33 to 13+16=29. Despite the incorrect process, the math in step 2 is internally consistent, but it fails to account for the orange marbles due to the omission of the first step. It is the first step that is referencing the incorrect process, so the wrong_step is 1.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly calculates the number of purple marbles. It should be 13 - 9 x 4 = -31, which is not possible. The correct number of purple marbles should be 13 - 9 x 4 = -31, which is not possible. The correct number of purple marbles should be 13 - 9 x 4 = 13 - 36 = -23. Therefore, the correct total amount of pink and purple marbles should be 13 + (-23) = -10. However, since the number of marbles cannot be negative, the correct answer is 0."
