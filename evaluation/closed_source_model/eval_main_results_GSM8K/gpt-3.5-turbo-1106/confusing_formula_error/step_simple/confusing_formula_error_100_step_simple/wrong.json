The original solution correctly uses the formula for area by multiplying the length by the width. In the transformed solution, the formula is mistakenly changed to a perimeter calculation by adding the length and width, resulting in 120 * 120 = 14400 square inches in the original_solution becoming 120 + 120 = 240 square inches in the transformed_solution.
