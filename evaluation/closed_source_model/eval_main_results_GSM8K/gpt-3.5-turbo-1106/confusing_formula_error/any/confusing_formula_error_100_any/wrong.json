        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the area and perimeter of the rectangle. The question requires solving for the total area of the mural in order to know how many square-inch tiles are needed, which is the product of its length and height, not the sum. This change is made by swapping multiplication for addition, transforming the correct area formula (length * height) into an incorrect perimeter one (length + height), thus altering the calculation from 180 inches * 120 inches = 21600 square inches to 180 inches + 120 inches = 300 inches. This fundamentally changes the answer from an area to what would be a linear measure, affecting only the formula in step 3 while leaving the language descriptions and the calculations in the prior steps unchanged. As such, the confused formula results in an erroneous count of tiles that would be needed if the mural's perimeter rather than its area were relevant.",

        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the area and perimeter calculations. The question requires finding the area by multiplying the length by the height, rather than adding them which would calculate perimeter. This results in transforming the correct formula '180 inches * 120 inches = 21600 square inches' from the original_solution into the incorrect '180 inches + 120 inches = 300 inches' for the transformed_solution. The language description 'Then multiply the length and the height to find the total area of the mural' in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution despite the formula being incorrectly changed to reflect perimeter calculation. The subsequent step is affected as it incorrectly assumes 300 inches is the number of tiles needed.

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and volume calculations. The original_solution properly calculates the volume of the rectangular prism by multiplying the side of the square base with itself and then by the height (2*2*8), but the transformed_solution incorrectly treats the calculation as if finding the perimeter of the base (2+2+2+2). By changing the formula from volume to perimeter, the result is an incorrect volume calculation, influencing the subsequent weight calculation in step 2. As a result, the original_solution's correct volume of 32 cubic meters used to find the weight (2700*32) is erroneously transformed to an incorrect volume of 8 cubic meters (2+2+2+2) and the subsequent incorrect weight (2700*8).
