        "explanation": "Here, the second step confuses the volume and perimeter of a cube. The total area should be the volume of a cube (length * width * height), not the sum of the edges which constitutes the perimeter. In this case, the edge lengths should be multiplied as length * width * height for volume. But instead, the sum of the lengths of all edges has been calculated as if it were a perimeter. This results in 20*20*20 being transformed to 20+20+20+20+20+20, which affects the subsequent step 3, changing from 8000/80=100 to 120/80=1.5. The language description remains unchanged despite the incorrect transformation in step 2. It is important to note that this transformation introduces only one step of a confusing formula error (volume vs. perimeter confusion), and the other calculation processes remain correct. The final answer differs from the original, illustrating the impact of using an incorrect formula.",

The question asks for the area, which should be found by multiplying the length by the width (8 * 4), but the formula is mistakenly transformed to calculate the perimeter (8 + 4 + 8 + 4). This change affects all subsequent calculations. The calculation of the total area occupied by 20 units changes from 20 * 32 to 20 * 24. The subtraction to find the remaining square footage changes accordingly, as does the final division to find the area of one remaining unit, changing the final answer from 200 square feet to 207.2727 square feet.
