This results in a cascade of errors through the subsequent steps. The original_solution stating that a bunny will come out of the hole 60*3=180 times is transformed to 50*3=150 times. Consequently, the 10-hour total for one bunny changes from 180*10=1800 in the original_solution to 150*10=1500 in the transformed_solution. The final combined count for 20 bunnies then changes from 1800*20=36000 times to 1500*20=30000 times.

This error impacts step 4, changing the calculation of the number of four-minute songs needed from 12 / 4 = 3 to 2 / 4 = 0.5.
