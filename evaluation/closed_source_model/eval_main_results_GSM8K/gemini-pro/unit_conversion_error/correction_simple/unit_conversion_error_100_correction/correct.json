        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 introduces an incorrect unit conversion, asserting that there are 10 inches in a foot instead of 12 inches. This mistake affects the width calculation of the bathroom, which transforms from 60 inches wide equals to 5 feet wide (60/12) in the original_solution to 60 inches wide equals to 6 feet wide (60/10) in the transformed_solution. Consequently, the square footage calculation in the final step is also impacted, changing from 50 sq feet (10*5) in the original_solution to 60 sq feet (10*6) in the transformed_solution. All other calculation steps remain accurate.",

        "corrected_answer": 50,
        "corrected_explanation": "The mistake in the original solution is that it incorrectly converts inches to feet. It states that there are 10 inches in a foot, which is incorrect. There are 12 inches in a foot. This error leads to an incorrect calculation of the width and length of the bathroom in feet, and consequently, an incorrect calculation of the square footage."

        "question": "Minnie is making a playlist of songs for a party she will be throwing. She wants the playlist to be an hour long. She has added 16 three-minute songs to the playlist. How many four-minute songs does she have to add to make sure the playlist is an hour long?",
        "original_solution": "An hour is equal to 60 minutes.\nMinnie has 16 * 3 = 48 minutes of songs already on the playlist.\nShe has to fill 60 - 48 = 12 more minutes.\nThus, she needs to add 12 / 4 = 3 four-minute songs.\n#### 3",

        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, an incorrect unit conversion is made in step 1, where an hour is wrongly considered equal to 50 minutes instead of the correct 60 minutes. As a result, the total time Minnie has to fill with four-minute songs is calculated as 50 - 48 = 2 minutes instead of 60 - 48 = 12 minutes. This error impacts step 4, changing the calculation of the number of four-minute songs needed from 12 / 4 = 3 to 2 / 4 = 0.5. The transformed answer of 0.5 is incorrect because it does not accurately reflect the number of four-minute songs needed to complete a one-hour playlist. This error only affects the related computational steps following the incorrect unit conversion; the previous computations remain unchanged.",
