Since the step 1 originally calculated the number of tickets sold each day by multiplying the total number of seats, 400, by the percentage filled, 80%, the modified solution should refer to the total number of seats directly. The subsequent step that originally referred to the result of this deleted step now uses the total number of seats, 400, multiplied by the ticket cost, $30. The largest number between the theater capacity (400) and the fill percentage (0.8) is 400, which is used in the corrected calculation. Step 2 of the modified solution now becomes step 1 itself, multiplying 400 by $30 to get $12,000, the incorrect revenue per day, changing from 320 * 30 to 400 * 30. The remaining steps are correctly following the structure of the original solution, where the performance days are added and then multiplied by the incorrect daily revenue, leading to a transformed answer of $36,000 instead of $28,800.

        "explanation": "In this case, we remove the first step from the original_solution. The original first step calculates how many peaches are fresh, based on the total count of 250 peaches, while the second step subtracts those that are too small from the fresh count. By removing the first step, we change the order of the calculations: first subtract the 15 too-small peaches from the total count, then calculate 60% of this new total. This sequence represents the transformed solution. The value changes because instead of calculating 60% of 250 and then subtracting 15, we first subtract 15 from 250 and calculate 60% of the remaining 235 peaches. Hence, the transformed_answer is 141 peaches, which is based on calculating the percent of 235 instead of 250. This error occurs in the first step of the transformed_solution because it changes the base number from which the percentage is calculated, making it the wrong step.",

Then, I incorrectly calculated this supposed difference in the number of houses, which caused a series of errors in the steps that follow. The final result is also incorrect because of this initial error in step 2, which misguides the calculation to find the difference in the number of candies instead of comparing the totals directly. It is step 2 in the transformed_solution—the first step that references the incorrect calculation after the deletion—which serves as the first step referencing incorrect number in the transformed_solution, hence the wrong_step is 2.",

But after eating just one of the cookies, he felt guilty about it and put the other two cookies back. His son, Louie Junior saw that his Dad was eating cookies. So, Louie Junior took seven cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom for later. The next morning, Debra, Lou's wife looked into the cookie jar and reacted by accusing her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the cookie jar. How many cookies remained in the jar?",

        "explanation": "In the original_solution, step 1 calculates the total number of cookies removed by Lou Sr by combining actions from two days, but step 1 can be seen as two distinct actions. To transform the solution, step 1 is modified by considering only the second action, removing the first day's 3 cookies resulting in 3-2=1 cookie removed. This initial action is directly taken from the question. The second step then changes accordingly, adding only the remaining cookies from day two plus the 7 from Louie Jr, resulting in 1+7=8 cookies removed. The last step remains valid as the logic still applies that the missing number of cookies equals those remaining. Thus, the first incorrect reference becomes the new step 1, replacing \"3+3-2=4\" with \"3-2=1\", reflecting only the second day's action. The removal of the first day's action causes the transformed_answer to be different from the original_answer which is necessary for the case generation process.",

He realizes first he has to get in shape to do it and it takes him 2 years of working out to get healthy enough to take up mountain climbing. He then spends twice that long learning how to be a technically proficient mountain climber. After that he starts with the simplest mountain on the list and climbs them all. He spends 5 months climbing each mountain. After that he takes 13 months learning to dive and dives through all the caves he wants in 2 years.

Step 4 of the original_solution, which references the result '4 years' from the deleted Step 1, gets modified. The time spent preparing and learning to dive (2 years + 13 months) remains unaltered. However, since step 1 was removed, the total years cannot include the 4 years from the removed step.
