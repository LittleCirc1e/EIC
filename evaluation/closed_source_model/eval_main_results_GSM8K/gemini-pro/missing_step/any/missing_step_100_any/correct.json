After removing this step, the next step, which should calculate the combined fence length, should reference the result from the previous step. However, the transformed solution incorrectly references the largest side length from the question, which is 27, assuming that one side of the garden shares the same length as the playground's side length. It makes an error by incorrectly calculating the garden's fence length as 2 * (27) = 54 yards. Subsequently, the calculation for the combined length becomes 108 + 54 = 162 yards.

Since step 1 of the original_solution referred to the 8 kg additional weight Jake has over Tracy, after removing this step, the subsequent related steps should now reference 52 kg (Tracy's weight, and the largest of the numbers referenced in the deleted step). This leads to step 1 of the transformed_solution, which originally computed Tracy and Jake's combined weight using Jake's actual weight, to instead double Tracy's weight (thus stepping away from the +8). As a result, Tracy and Jake's combined weight is incorrectly listed as 52+52 kg, and the remaining steps are updated accordingly to keep consistency. This causes a change of calculated values in steps 2 and 3, now using the incorrect combined weight for the formula and subsequently changing the result of their range, from 60-46 = 14kg to 60-54 = 6kg.

This incorrect step results in the subsequent step calculating Walt's Wednesday walk by subtracting 52 from 41, yielding an incorrect negative distance.

This causes a change in subsequent calculations, where now the total number of pebbles is divided by 4 groups instead of 3, which is a mistake because the question specifies the remaining pebbles are divided into 3 groups, not 4. This incorrect modification affects the calculation of yellow pebbles resulting in a different answer, as the division would then include the blue pebbles in the count.
