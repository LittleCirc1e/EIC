        "original_solution": "Roger rode for 2 miles in the morning, and then 5 times that in the evening for 5*2=10 miles ridden in the evening\nIn total, that means Roger rode 2+10=12 miles over the course of the day.\n#### 12",
        "original_answer": 12.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Roger rode for 2 miles in the morning, and then 5 times that in the evening for 5*2=10 miles ridden in the evening\nBecause he also did a short ride of 1 mile before going to bed, in total, that means Roger rode 2+10+1=13 miles over the course of the day.\n#### 13",

        "wrong_type": "adding_irrelevant_information",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 2 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <Because he also did a short ride of 1 mile before going to bed>, resulting in step 2 changing from 2+10=12 miles over the course of the day in the original_solution to 2+10+1=13 miles over the course of the day in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "any_explanation": "The solution is incorrect. The question states that Roger rode his bike for 2 miles in the morning, and then 5 times that amount in the evening. So the total distance he rode in the evening is 2 * 5 = 10 miles, not 10 + 1 = 11 miles. Therefore, the total distance he rode over the course of the day is 2 + 10 = 12 miles, not 13 miles."
