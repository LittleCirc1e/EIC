This simplifies to $0.25G = $20> and calculates its result 20 correctly. And step 4 is affected by step 3 and changes $20/$0.25 to $25/$0.25 leading to a wrong result of 100 GB instead of 80 GB. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all steps is still correct.",

        "any_explanation": "The solution is incorrect. The correct answer should be 80 GB. The total bill is $0.25G + $45 flat rate charge = $65 total bill. Now we will solve for G. $0.25G + $45 flat rate - $45 = $65 -$45. This simplifies to $0.25G = $20. $0.25G/$0.25 = $20/$0.25. G = 80 GB were charged on this bill."
