        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly calculated the area of a single glass pane by adding the length and width instead of multiplying them. The correct area of a single glass pane is 96 sq in, and the correct area of the window is 768 sq in."

        "question": "Bill gets a flat-screen TV that measures 48 inches by 100 inches. His brother Bob gets a TV that measures 70 inches by 60 inches. If the TVs weigh 4 oz per square inch of screen space, how much more does the heavier TV weigh in pounds? (There are 16 ounces per pound).",
        "original_solution": "First find the screen area of Bill's TV: 48 inches * 100 inches = 4800 square inches\nThen find the screen area of Bob's TV: 70 inches * 60 inches = 4200 square inches\nThen subtract the size of the smaller TV from the size of the bigger TV to find the size difference: 4800 square inches - 4200 square inches = 600 square inches\nThen multiply the size difference by the weight per square inch to find the weight difference: 600 square inches * 4 oz/square inch = 2400 oz\nThen divide the weight difference in ounces by the number of ounces per pound to find the weight difference in pounds: 2400 oz / 16 oz/pound = 150 pounds\n#### 150",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 mistakenly uses the perimeter formula instead of the area formula for Bill’s TV. The question requires finding the area (length multiplied by width), but the step has been modified to calculate the perimeter (sum of all sides), leading to 48 inches * 100 inches = 4800 square inches in the original_solution becoming 48 inches + 48 inches + 100 inches + 100 inches = 296 inches in the transformed_solution. This error changes the values in the subsequent calculation steps, as the subtraction is now incorrect and thus affects the calculation of the weight difference in both ounces and pounds. All other calculation processes are correct, with only step 1 containing the error. The wording of the step remains as <First find the screen area of Bill's TV:>, but the calculation thereafter is altered to fit the error introduced.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution is incorrect because it subtracted the screen area of Bob's TV from the perimeter of Bill's TV, which is not the correct way to find the size difference between the two TVs. The correct way is to subtract the screen area of the smaller TV from the screen area of the bigger TV."

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and volume calculations. The original_solution properly calculates the volume of the rectangular prism by multiplying the side of the square base with itself and then by the height (2*2*8), but the transformed_solution incorrectly treats the calculation as if finding the perimeter of the base (2+2+2+2). By changing the formula from volume to perimeter, the result is an incorrect volume calculation, influencing the subsequent weight calculation in step 2. As a result, the original_solution's correct volume of 32 cubic meters used to find the weight (2700*32) is erroneously transformed to an incorrect volume of 8 cubic meters (2+2+2+2) and the subsequent incorrect weight (2700*8).
