The total area should be the volume of a cube (length * width * height), not the sum of the edges which constitutes the perimeter. In this case, the edge lengths should be multiplied as length * width * height for volume. But instead, the sum of the lengths of all edges has been calculated as if it were a perimeter. This results in 20*20*20 being transformed to 20+20+20+20+20+20, which affects the subsequent step 3, changing from 8000/80=100 to 120/80=1.5. The language description remains unchanged despite the incorrect transformation in step 2. It is important to note that this transformation introduces only one step of a confusing formula error (volume vs. perimeter confusion), and the other calculation processes remain correct.
