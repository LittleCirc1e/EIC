        "question": "The coach of a football team asked his players to do six laps of the field. The field is in the shape of a rectangle of length 100 m and width 50 m. What is the distance each player will run, in meters?",
        "original_solution": "One lap corresponds to the perimeter of a rectangle of 100 m length and 50 m width: 2*100 + 2*50 = 300 metres.\nEach player has to do six turns of the field, so runs 6*300 = 1800 meters.\n#### 1800",
        "original_answer": 1800.0,
        "transformed_solution": "One lap corresponds to the area of a rectangle of 100 m length and 50 m width: 100*50 = 5000 metres.\nEach player has to do six turns of the field, so runs 6*5000 = 30000 meters.\n#### 30000",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and area of rectangle. The question requires calculating the perimeter of the rectangle for one lap, which is the sum of all sides, not the area. The original_solution correctly applies the perimeter formula 2*length + 2*width for a single lap. In the transformed_solution, the formula used is for the area (length * width) instead of the perimeter, resulting in 100*50 = 5000 metres for one lap instead of 2*100 + 2*50 = 300 metres. This error impacts step 2, where the total distance run changes from 6*300 = 1800 meters to 6*5000 = 30000 meters. The language description of step 1 in the original_solution 'One lap corresponds to the perimeter of a rectangle' remains unchanged in the transformed_solution, even though a different formula is applied.",

        "question": "The perimeter of a square-shaped piece of paper is 20 cm shorter than the height of a computer screen. How many cm is the height of the screen if the side of the square paper is 20 cm?",
        "original_solution": "The perimeter of a square is found by 4*side, which means the square paper has a perimeter of 4*20 = 80\nSince the perimeter of the square is 20 cm shorter than the height of the computer screen, the height of the computer screen is 20+80 = 100cm.\n#### 100",

The original solution correctly uses 4*20 to calculate the perimeter, but the transformed solution incorrectly uses 20^2. This is a formula for the area of a square, not the perimeter. This confusion in formula affects our final calculation for the height of the computer screen, changing the calculation from 20+80 in the original solution to 20+400 in the transformed solution.

        "question": "Bob is building a garden on his land, and he wants it to be fenced in to keep out varmints. The garden is a rectangular plot 225 feet long by 125 feet wide. He also wants to have a small 3-foot wide gate to walk through and a larger 10-foot wide gate to move his gardening equipment through. How much fencing is Bob going to need to fence in his garden, taking into account the two gates?",
        "original_solution": "The perimeter of the garden is 2 * 225 + 2 * 125 = 450 + 250 = 700 feet.\nMinus the two gates, he will need at least 700 - 3 - 10 = 687 feet of fencing.\n#### 687",

The correct formula for perimeter is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width (2 * length + 2 * width), whereas the formula used in the transformation is for area (length * width). Consequently, the correct calculation for the perimeter, 2 * 225 + 2 * 125, is replaced with an incorrect calculation of area, 225 * 125. This improper calculation leads to an erroneous total length of fencing required, 28112 feet instead of the correct 687 feet. The subsequent subtraction of the gate widths is correct in itself, but stems from the incorrect calculation of the perimeter.",

Since we are calculating perimeter instead of area in this step, this will give us a different number of tiles.

        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the perimeter and area of a rectangle. The question requires that the total area of the mural to be solved, which would be the length multiplied by the height. Instead, the length and height are added together, which would calculate the perimeter if the width were also a part of the calculation, resulting in 180 inches * 120 inches = 21600 square inches in the original_solution becoming 180 inches + 120 inches = 300 inches in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent understanding of the result as the number of tiles needed by Mary, changing from 21600 tiles to an incorrect 300 tiles based on perimeter rather than area. Note that the language descriptions of the steps in the original_solution remain unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 3 mistakenly uses the addition suitable for calculating perimeter instead of the multiplication required for area, while the other calculation processes are still correct, although they are now based on an incorrect transformed_step.",

In this case, we need to calculate the area of the mural to find the number of tiles needed."
