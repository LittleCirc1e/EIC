The error affects the subsequent steps that rely on the number of individuals who play football. The percentage is recalculated from 12/60 = 20% to 10/60 ≈ 16.67%, and finally, the expected number of individuals who play football out of 250 is miscalculated as 250*16.67% ≈ 41.675 instead of the correct 250*20% = 50.
