        "question": "Annie has 6 barrettes, twice as many scrunchies as barrettes, and three fewer bobby pins than barrettes. What percentage of her hair decorations are bobby pins, rounded to the nearest percent?",
        "original_solution": "First find the total number of scrunchies: 6 barrettes * 2 = 12 scrunchies\nThen subtract three fewer bobby pins than barrettes 6-3 =3 bobby pins\nThen add the number of each type of hair decorations to find the total number: 6 decorations + 12 decorations + 3 decorations = 21 decorations\nThen divide the number of bobby pins by the total number of decorations and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 3 bobby pins / 21 decorations * 100% = 14.28 which rounds down to 14%\n#### 14",

        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The error is introduced in step 2 where the number of bobby pins is mistakenly calculated as 6 instead of 3. This error affects subsequent step 3, which changes the addition from 6 decorations + 12 decorations + 3 decorations to 6 decorations + 12 decorations + 6 decorations, which results in a total of 24 decorations instead of 21. Step 4 then uses this incorrect total to calculate the percentage, resulting in 6/24 * 100% = 25% instead of the correct calculation with 3/21 decorations. The previous step 1 remains unchanged because it is correct and unrelated to the error in step 2.",

        "corrected_solution": "First find the total number of scrunchies: 6 barrettes * 2 = 12 scrunchies\nThen find the number of bobby pins, which is three fewer than the number of barrettes: 6 barrettes - 3 = 3 bobby pins\nThen add the number of each type of hair decorations to find the total number: 6 barrettes + 12 scrunchies + 3 bobby pins = 21 decorations\nThen divide the number of bobby pins by the total number of decorations and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 3 bobby pins / 21 decorations * 100% â‰ˆ 14.29% which rounds to 14%\n",
        "corrected_answer": "0.14",
        "corrected_explanation": "The original solution incorrectly calculated the number of bobby pins and the final percentage. There should be 3 bobby pins, not 6, and the percentage should be rounded to the nearest whole number, which is 14% not 25%."
