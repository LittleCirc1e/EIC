        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 hour is wrongly equal to 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes, resulting in 3 hours * 60 minutes = 180 minutes in the original_solution becoming 3 hours * 50 minutes = 150 minutes in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 5, which changes from 180 – 55 = 125 minutes for the radio show to play songs to 150 – 55 = 95 minutes for the radio show to play songs. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, so the unit conversion of step 2, 3, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",

        "original_solution": "If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12*1=12 inches=1 foot.\nSince Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, then Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4*1=4 feet.\nAnd since Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami. then Naruto can lift a mountain 10*4=40 feet.\n#### 40",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 12 inches is wrongly equal to 2 feet instead of 1 foot, resulting in Saskay being able to lift 12 inches = 1 foot in the original_solution becoming Saskay being able to lift 12 inches = 2 feet in the transformed_solution. This incorrect conversion impacts the subsequent related calculations for Kagiyami and Naruto, affecting steps 2 and 3. Step 2 changes from Kagiyami lifting 4*1=4 feet in the original_solution to 4*2=8 feet in the transformed_solution. Similarly, step 3 changes from Naruto lifting a mountain 10*4=40 feet to 10*8=80 feet. It should be noted that only the unit conversion error is made, without affecting the previous steps and the multiplication process itself, only the value used has changed due to the conversion error.",

        "any_explanation": "The solution correctly multiplies the lifting capacities at each step to find Naruto's ultimate lifting capacity, starting from Pompei's base capacity of 1 inch, converting inches to feet where appropriate."
