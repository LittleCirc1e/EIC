        "corrected_solution": "Jeremy is driving 600 miles, at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, so he will be driving for 600 miles / 50 miles per hour = 12 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is 12 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 720 minutes of driving. He makes a rest stop every 2 hours of driving, which is 12 hours / 2 hours per rest stop = 6 rest stops on the trip. Each rest stop takes 15 minutes, so he will spend 6 rest stops * 15 minutes per rest stop = 90 minutes on rest stops. His car gets 18 miles to the gallon, and he stops to refill every 15 gallons, so he will stop to refill after 270 miles, which is 600 miles / 270 miles per refuel = 2.22 refuels. Since he can't refuel 0.22 of a time, he'll only make 2 refuels during the trip. He will spend 2 refuels * 10 minutes per refuel = 20 minutes refueling his car. In total, he will take 720 minutes driving + 90 minutes resting + 20 minutes refueling = 830 minutes.",
        "corrected_answer": "830.0",
        "corrected_explanation": "The original solution incorrectly calculated the driving time by not converting hours to minutes correctly. It also miscalculated the number of rest stops and the total time spent resting. The corrected solution provides the accurate calculation for the total time taken, including driving, rest stops, and refueling."
