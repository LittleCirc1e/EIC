        "question": "Francis' family has 2 ukuleles, 4 guitars, and a certain number of violins. Each ukulele has 4 strings. Each guitar has 6 strings. Each violin has 4 strings. If the total number of strings among the ukuleles, guitars, and violins is 40 strings, how many violins does Francis' family have?",
        "original_solution": "From the ukuleles, there are 2 * 4 = 8 strings\nFrom the guitars, there are 4 * 6 = 24 strings\nFrom the violins, there are 40 - 8 - 24 = 8 strings\nThe total number of violins Francis' family has is 8 / 4 = 2 violins\n#### 2",
        "original_answer": 2.0,
        "transformed_solution": "From the guitars, there are 4 * 6 = 24 strings\nFrom the violins, there are 40 - 24 = 16 strings\nThe total number of violins Francis' family has is 16 / 4 = 4 violins\n#### 4",

        "explanation": "This example removes step 1 from the original_solution, which calculates the number of strings from the ukuleles. In the original_solution, step 1 references the number 2 from the question and the number 4 that represents the string count of ukuleles, step 2 calculates the strings from the guitars and references number 4 and 6 from the question, and step 3 references the results of step 1 and step 2. Therefore, after deleting step 1, step 3 in the new solution should reference the result of step 2 directly and ignore the information about the ukuleles. It changes the formula from 40 - 8 - 24 to 40 - 24 which simplifies calculating the strings from violins. The explanation assumes the resulting value represents the total strings of violins to calculate the number of violins. Step 4 as the final step that calculates the number of violins has changed the divisor to the revised total string count. Instead of dividing by 8, it inaccurately divides 16 by 4, arriving at a wrong conclusion of 4 violins instead of the correct 2. It is step 2 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 3 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing incorrect information in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 2.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the number of strings from the guitars, then subtracts that from the total number of strings to find the number of strings from the violins. It correctly assumes that all the remaining strings must come from violins since the number of strings from the ukuleles is already known and accounted for. The solution then divides the number of strings from the violins by the number of strings per violin to find the total number of violins, which is 4."

However, this has been incorrectly omitted, and the calculation of pigs is directly based on the number of sheep from the removed step, resulting in an unaccounted number of sheep in step 2. The subsequent step 3, which originally summed up pigs, sheep, and cows, now incorrectly sums up just pigs and cows, leading to a wrong total count of animals on the farm.

Therefore, the transformed_solution should have started with the calculation based on the 60 pounds Jack weighs. However, instead of calculating the weight difference from step 1 and dividing that by the weight of each rock, the transformed_solution incorrectly refers directly to Jack's weight. This leads to a calculation of 60 pounds divided by 4 pounds per rock, equaling 15 rocks. The correct intermediate calculation of the weight difference was not considered, resulting in the number of needed rocks being artificially increased to 15.

Since each rock weighs 4 pounds, 20 pounds divided by 4 pounds per rock is indeed 5 rocks. However, the solution incorrectly states the calculation as 60 pounds divided by 4 pounds per rock, which is not the correct approach. The number of rocks needed is 5, not 15. Therefore, although the process is incorrect, the final answer is coincidentally correct."
