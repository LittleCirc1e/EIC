        "explanation": "Here, step 2 mistakenly counts the number of days Zainab passes out flyers as 2 days instead of 3 days per week, resulting in the original calculation of $8/day * 3 days = $24 being changed to $8/day * 2 days = $16 in the transformed_solution. Subsequently, the error affects step 3, changing the final calculation from $24 * 4 = $96 to $16 * 4 = $64. The initial earning calculation for a single day remains unaffected by the counting error, and only the subsequent steps that rely on the number of days are impacted.",

So, she earns $2/hour * 4 hours = $8 per day.\nShe passes out flyers on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, which is a total of 3 days a week.\nSo, in a week, she earns $8/day * 3 days = $24.\nAfter passing out flyers for 4 weeks, she will earn $24/week * 4 weeks = $96.",
