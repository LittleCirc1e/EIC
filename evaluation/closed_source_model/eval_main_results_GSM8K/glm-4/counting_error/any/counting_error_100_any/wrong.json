This counting error affects step 4, changing the weekly total from 9 + 12 = 21 miles to 9 + 18 = 27 miles, and step 5, affecting the total monthly distance from 21 x 4 = 84 miles to 27 x 4 = 108 miles.

How many kilometers did the driver travel during these 5 days?",

This error affects both step 3 and the subsequent step 4, which then calculates the distance for Thursday and Friday as 2 * 9 = 18 kilometers instead of 4 * 9 = 36 kilometers. The final step calculates the total distance as 72 + 18 = 90 kilometers instead of the correct 72 + 36 = 108 kilometers.
