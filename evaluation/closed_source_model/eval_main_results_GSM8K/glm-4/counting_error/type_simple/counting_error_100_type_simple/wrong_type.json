        "question": "From Monday to Friday, Elle practices piano for 30 minutes. On Saturday, she practices piano three times as much as on a weekday. There is no practice on Sunday.  How many hours does Elle spend practicing piano each week?",
        "original_solution": "From Monday to Friday, Elle practices 0.50 x 5 = 2.5 hours.\nOn Saturday, she practices 0.50 x 3 = 1.5 hours.\nEach week, Elle practices piano for 2.5 + 1.5 = 4 hours.\n#### 4",
        "original_answer": 4.0,
        "transformed_solution": "From Monday to Friday, Elle practices 0.50 x 4 = 2 hours.\nOn Saturday, she practices 0.50 x 3 = 1.5 hours.\nEach week, Elle practices piano for 2 + 1.5 = 3.5 hours.\n#### 3.5",
        "transformed_answer": 3.5,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 erroneously counts Monday to Friday as 4 days instead of 5 days, resulting in the calculation of 0.50 x 5=2.5 hours becoming 0.50 x 4=2 hours. And it affects step 3, changing it from 2.5 + 1.5 = 4 hours to 2 + 1.5 = 3.5 hours. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of counting error; the other calculation processes related to this error are still correct.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "type_explanation": "The calculation in the first step is incorrect. Elle practices for 30 minutes each weekday, which is 0.50 hours, but the calculation multiplies by 4 instead of 5 days."
