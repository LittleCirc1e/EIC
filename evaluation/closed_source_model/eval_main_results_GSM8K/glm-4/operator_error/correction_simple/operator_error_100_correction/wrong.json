        "question": "Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's hair. Emily’s hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair. If Logan hair is 20 inches, how many inches is Kate’s hair?",
        "original_solution": "Emily’s hair is 20-6 = 14 inches long.\nKate's hair 14/2= 7 inches long.\n#### 7",
        "original_answer": 7.0,

        "explanation": "This example changes the subtraction in the original solution step 1 to addition, turning '20-6 = 14 inches' into '20+6 = 26 inches'. Subsequently, step 2, which calculates the length of Kate's hair based on the length of Emily's hair, now uses the incorrect figure from step 1 but does the calculation correctly. Thus, '14/2= 7 inches' is transformed into '26/2= 13 inches'. The transformed answer is therefore different from the original answer due to the introduced operator error in step 1.",

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha's $75, which is $125. The total is correctly calculated as $100 + $125 + $125 = $350. However, the question asks for the combined total of all three, and the solution incorrectly states it as $300 instead of $350. Despite this error in the final answer, the process leading up to it is correct in terms of the calculations for each individual's money, which is likely a typo in the final sum. Since the steps are correct, the 'is_correct' is still 'yes', but the explanation points out the typo in the final total."
