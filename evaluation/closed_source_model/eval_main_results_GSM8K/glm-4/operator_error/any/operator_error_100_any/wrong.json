If the container she hopes to store the bubble mix in can hold 40 ounces of liquid, and there are 8 ounces in a cup of water, how many tablespoons of soap should she add to the container (assuming that the soap itself doesn't count towards the capacity of the container)?",
        "original_solution": "The 40-ounce container can hold 40/8 = 5 cups of water.\nThis means that 5*3 = 15 tablespoons of soap should be used, since each cup of water requires 3 tablespoons of soap.\n#### 15",

This incorrect value is used in step 2 to incorrectly multiply by the 3 tablespoons of soap per cup, resulting in a mistaken value of 960 tablespoons of soap. The error is only in the operator change in step 1; the calculations are correct based on the wrong assumption, but the result is incorrect.

However, the solution incorrectly states that 320 cups of water are needed, which leads to an incorrect calculation of 960 tablespoons. The correct amount should be 5 cups * 3 tablespoons = 15 tablespoons.
