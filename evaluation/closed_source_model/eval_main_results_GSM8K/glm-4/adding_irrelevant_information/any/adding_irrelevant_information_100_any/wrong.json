        "question": "Nancy, the librarian, is shelving books from the cart. She shelved 12 history books, 8 romance books, and 4 poetry books from the top section of the cart. Half the books on the bottom section of the cart were mystery books, which she quickly put back into place. Then, she shelved the remaining books from the bottom of the cart, including 5 Western novels and 6 biographies. How many books did she have on the book cart when she started?",
        "original_solution": "Half of the books on the bottom section of the cart are mystery books, which means they are the same as the number of Western novels and biographies put together. So there are 5 + 6 = 11 mystery novels.\nAdd them all together, and there are 12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 11 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies = 46 books total\n#### 46",
        "original_answer": 46.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Half of the books on the bottom section of the cart are mystery books, which means they are the same number as the sum of Western novels, biographies, and an additional 3 literature textbooks that Nancy forgot to count initially. So there are 5 Western novels + 6 biographies + 3 literature textbooks = 14 books that are not mystery novels.\nThe mystery books are the same amount, so there are also 14 mystery novels.\nTo find the total, we sum up all the categories: 12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 14 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies + 3 literature = 52 books total\n#### 52",

        "wrong_type": "adding_irrelevant_information",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The modified step 1 adds information that is not mentioned in the original question statement <and an additional 3 literature textbooks that Nancy forgot to count initially>, resulting in the transformation of the step from \"5 + 6 = 11 mystery novels\" in the original_solution to \"5 Western novels + 6 biographies + 3 literature textbooks = 14 books that are not mystery novels\" in the transformed_solution. This affects the following summation step, changing the total from \"12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 11 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies = 46 books\" to \"12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 14 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies + 3 literature = 52 books\". The other calculation processes remain correct.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the number of books in each category and sums them up to get the total number of books on the cart, which is 52 books."

        "question": "A luxury bag costs $3000. A reseller wants to get a 15% profit. How much should she sell the bag?",
        "original_solution": "The reseller wants to get $3000 x 15/100 = $450 profit.\nThus, she needs to sell it for $3000 + $450 = $3450.\n#### 3450",
        "original_answer": 3450.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The reseller wants to get $3000 x 15/100 = $450 profit. Because she provides premium packaging which costs $50, the total cost increases to $3050.\nThus, she needs to sell it for $3050 + $450 = $3500.\n#### 3500",

        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "adding_irrelevant_information",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 1 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <Because she provides premium packaging which costs $50>, resulting in an elevated total cost from $3000 to $3050. This affects step 2, changing the sum from $3000 + $450 to $3050 + $450. The transformed_answer is thus changed to $3500. It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the 15% profit on the cost price of the bag and adds it to the total cost, which includes the cost of premium packaging. The final selling price is the sum of the total cost and the profit, which is $3500 as calculated."
