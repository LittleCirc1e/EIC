        "explanation": "Step 2 of the original solution is modified to add information not mentioned in the question: <Because the puppy is a fast grower, his food intake will increase to 1/2 cup a day by the third week>. This change affects the total amount of food the puppy will eat, increasing it from 7 cups to 8.5 cups. As a result, Mark needs to buy 3 bags of food instead of 2, changing the total cost from $14 to $16. The error of adding irrelevant information leads to a single wrong transformation of the original solution's outcome.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "He needs food for 21 days because 3 weeks x 7 days/week = 21 days. The puppy eats 1/3 cup of food a day for the first two weeks, which is 14 days, so it will eat (1/3 cup/day) x 14 days = 4.6667 cups. In the third week, the puppy's intake increases to 1/2 cup a day, which is 7 days, so it will eat (1/2 cup/day) x 7 days = 3.5 cups. In total, the puppy will eat 4.6667 cups + 3.5 cups = 8.1667 cups. He needs 3 bags of food because 8.1667 cups / 3.5 cups/bag = 2.3477, and he can't buy a fraction of a bag. Rounding up, he will buy 3 bags. Thus, the food will cost him $6 because 3 bags x $2/bag = $6.",
        "corrected_answer": " 6.0",
        "corrected_explanation": "The corrected calculation accounts for the puppy's food intake for the first two weeks and the third week separately. It adds the cost of the food to the cost of the puppy, resulting in a total cost."
