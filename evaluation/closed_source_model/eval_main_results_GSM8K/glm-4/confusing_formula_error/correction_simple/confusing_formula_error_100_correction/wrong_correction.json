        "corrected_solution": "The original length of the bathroom is 96 sq ft / 8 ft = 12 ft. The new length remains the same since the extension is on the sides, not at the end, so it is still 12 ft. The new width of the bathroom is 8 ft + 2 ft + 2 ft = 12 ft. The new area of the bathroom is 12 ft x 12 ft = 144 sq ft.",
        "corrected_answer": "144.0",

        "explanation": "Here, in step 1, the calculation of the total surface area has been incorrectly changed to calculate total length around the classroom like a perimeter, which is not the correct approach as it neglects the height and considers only length and width. The appropriate method is to consider length, width, and height to calculate the surface area of the walls.

        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "First, calculate the total surface area of the walls and ceiling to be painted. The classroom has 4 walls and a ceiling, but the floor is not painted. The area of each wall is the length times the height, and since there are two of each length, we double that. The ceiling area is the length times the width. So, the total area is: (9m * 3m * 2) + (8m * 3m * 2) + (9m * 8m) = 54m^2 + 48m^2 + 72m^2 = 174m^2. Subtract the areas of the windows, blackboards, and doors: 4 windows at 1.5m^2 each is 6m^2, 2 blackboards at 6m^2 each is 12m^2, and 2 doors at 2m^2 each is 4m^2. The total area to be painted is 174m^2 - 6m^2 - 12m^2 - 4m^2 = 150m^2. Now, we calculate the cost: 150m^2 * $4.80/m^2 = $720.",
