There are also four flower beds: two right in front of the house that are 4 feet deep by 25 feet long, one that is 10 feet by 12 feet, and a fourth that is 7 feet by 8 feet. How many square feet of sod will she need to cover her yard, minus the sidewalk and flower beds?",

There are two, so that's 2 * 100 sq.ft. = 200 sq.ft.\nThe third flower bed is 10 feet by 12 feet, or 10ft * 12ft = 120 sq.ft.\nThe fourth flower bed is 7 feet by 8 feet, or 7ft * 8ft = 56 sq.ft.\nThe total area of the sidewalk and flower beds is 150 sq.ft + 200 sq.ft + 120 sq.ft + 56 sq.ft = 526 sq. ft.\nSo Jill will need a total of 10,000 sq.ft - 526 sq.ft = 9,474 sq.ft. of sod.\n#### 9474",

This error impacts the total area computation of sidewalks and flower beds and the final subtraction to determine the amount of sod needed. All other steps except for the mistake in step 2 are correctly applying their respective formulas. It is important to note that the transformed solution only modifies the formula applied in step 2, keeping the same language description, without changing any words in the language description to ensure consistency with the example cases.

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter calculation of a square with its area calculation. The original solution correctly uses the formula for the perimeter of a square (4*side), replacing this with the area calculation formula (side*side) in the transformed solution. As a result, the original calculation for the perimeter: 4*20 = 80 cm is incorrectly changed to an area calculation: 20*20 = 400 cm, which falsely represents the perimeter of the square paper instead of its area. This error then affects step 2, where the sum calculates the height of the computer screen using the mistaken value, changing from 20+80 = 100 cm to 20+400 = 420 cm. The language descriptions in the solution steps remain the same; only the formula used is altered to create the erroneous transformed solution.

This fundamentally changes the answer from an area to what would be a linear measure, affecting only the formula in step 3 while leaving the language descriptions and the calculations in the prior steps unchanged. As such, the confused formula results in an erroneous count of tiles that would be needed if the mural's perimeter rather than its area were relevant.",

        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the area and perimeter calculations. The question requires finding the area by multiplying the length by the height, rather than adding them which would calculate perimeter. This results in transforming the correct formula '180 inches * 120 inches = 21600 square inches' from the original_solution into the incorrect '180 inches + 120 inches = 300 inches' for the transformed_solution. The language description 'Then multiply the length and the height to find the total area of the mural' in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution despite the formula being incorrectly changed to reflect perimeter calculation. The subsequent step is affected as it incorrectly assumes 300 inches is the number of tiles needed.

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and volume calculations. The original_solution properly calculates the volume of the rectangular prism by multiplying the side of the square base with itself and then by the height (2*2*8), but the transformed_solution incorrectly treats the calculation as if finding the perimeter of the base (2+2+2+2). By changing the formula from volume to perimeter, the result is an incorrect volume calculation, influencing the subsequent weight calculation in step 2. As a result, the original_solution's correct volume of 32 cubic meters used to find the weight (2700*32) is erroneously transformed to an incorrect volume of 8 cubic meters (2+2+2+2) and the subsequent incorrect weight (2700*8).

        "corrected_explanation": "The original solution incorrectly calculated the volume of the rectangular prism by simply adding the dimensions, which is not the correct method.
