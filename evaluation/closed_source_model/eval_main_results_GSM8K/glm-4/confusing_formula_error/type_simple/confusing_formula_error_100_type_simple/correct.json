        "question": "Bob is building a garden on his land, and he wants it to be fenced in to keep out varmints. The garden is a rectangular plot 225 feet long by 125 feet wide. He also wants to have a small 3-foot wide gate to walk through and a larger 10-foot wide gate to move his gardening equipment through. How much fencing is Bob going to need to fence in his garden, taking into account the two gates?",
        "original_solution": "The perimeter of the garden is 2 * 225 + 2 * 125 = 450 + 250 = 700 feet.\nMinus the two gates, he will need at least 700 - 3 - 10 = 687 feet of fencing.\n#### 687",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and area of a rectangle. The question asks for the perimeter needed for fencing, including gates, which requires summing twice the length and twice the width. However, the transformed solution incorrectly calculates the area by multiplying the length by the width. This mistake changes the operation from perimeter calculation (2 * 225 + 2 * 125) in the original solution to an area calculation (225 * 125) in the transformed solution. As a result, step 2 is affected by using the wrong value for the garden dimensions, changing from subtracting the gate widths from the correct perimeter (700 - 3 - 10) to subtracting them from the incorrect area calculation (28125 - 3 - 10). The other steps have not been changed, and the language descriptions remain unaltered in the transformed solution. This is a single error due to confusing formulas for perimeter and area.",

        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the area and perimeter of the rectangle. The question requires solving for the total area of the mural in order to know how many square-inch tiles are needed, which is the product of its length and height, not the sum. This change is made by swapping multiplication for addition, transforming the correct area formula (length * height) into an incorrect perimeter one (length + height), thus altering the calculation from 180 inches * 120 inches = 21600 square inches to 180 inches + 120 inches = 300 inches. This fundamentally changes the answer from an area to what would be a linear measure, affecting only the formula in step 3 while leaving the language descriptions and the calculations in the prior steps unchanged. As such, the confused formula results in an erroneous count of tiles that would be needed if the mural's perimeter rather than its area were relevant.",

        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the area and perimeter calculations. The question requires finding the area by multiplying the length by the height, rather than adding them which would calculate perimeter. This results in transforming the correct formula '180 inches * 120 inches = 21600 square inches' from the original_solution into the incorrect '180 inches + 120 inches = 300 inches' for the transformed_solution. The language description 'Then multiply the length and the height to find the total area of the mural' in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution despite the formula being incorrectly changed to reflect perimeter calculation. The subsequent step is affected as it incorrectly assumes 300 inches is the number of tiles needed. Other previous steps and language descriptions remain the same since only one step has been transformed and it is the first error in the sequence.",
