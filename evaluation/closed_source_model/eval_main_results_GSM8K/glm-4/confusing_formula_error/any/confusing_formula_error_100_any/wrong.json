        "question": "There is a rectangle that is 4 inches wide. If the rectangle's perimeter is 30 inches, what is the area of the rectangle?",
        "original_solution": "Twice the height of the rectangle is 30 inches - 2 * 4 inches = 22 inches.\nThe rectangle's height is 22 inches / 2 = 11 inches.\nThe area of the rectangle is 4 inches * 11 inches = 44 square inches.\n#### 44",
        "original_answer": 44.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Twice the height of the rectangle is 30 inches - 4 inches + 4 inches = 30 inches.\nThe rectangle's height is 30 inches / 2 = 15 inches.\nThe area of the rectangle is 15 inches * 4 inches = 60 square inches.\n#### 60",
        "transformed_answer": 60.0,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the correct approach to find twice the height with an incorrect approach that would add the width back twice instead of subtracting it to find the perimeter, creating an erroneous solution. The question requires that twice the height be found by subtracting the total width of both sides from the perimeter, resulting in 30 inches - 2 * 4 inches in the original_solution, which has been incorrectly transformed into 30 inches - 4 inches + 4 inches in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 2, changing from 22 inches / 2 to 30 inches / 2 to find the height, and ultimately, the step 3, changing from the correct area of 4 inches * 11 inches to an incorrect area of 15 inches * 4 inches. Note that the language description of each step in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should also be noted that only one step has the confusing formula error, while the formulas for other steps are correct, and the transformed_answer is different from the original_answer.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the height of the rectangle by subtracting the width from the perimeter and then divides it by 2 since the perimeter is the sum of all sides. It then multiplies the height by the width to find the area, which is done correctly."
