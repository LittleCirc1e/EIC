        "question": "The rim of a standard basketball hoop is 10 feet above the ground.  Additionally, most experts will say that a player must be able to reach at least 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball.  Suppose a basketball player is 6 feet tall and can reach 22 inches above their head using the wingspan of their arms.  How high must this player be able to jump to reach 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball?",
        "original_solution": "In inches, the height of the rim is 10*12 = 120 inches.\nThus, the height that the player needs to be able to reach is 120 + 6 = 126 inches.\nWithout jumping, the player can reach their height plus an additional 22 inches, or a total of 6*12 + 22 = 94 inches.\nTherefore, the player needs to jump 126 - 94 = 32 inches to reach the height required to dunk a basketball.\n#### 32",
        "original_answer": 32.0,
        "transformed_solution": "In inches, the height of the rim is 11*12 = 132 inches.\nThus, the height that the player needs to be able to reach is 132 + 6 = 138 inches.\nWithout jumping, the player can reach their height plus an additional 22 inches, or a total of 6*12 + 22 = 94 inches.\nTherefore, the player needs to jump 138 - 94 = 44 inches to reach the height required to dunk a basketball.\n#### 44",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 1 references 10 in the question as 11 wrongly and calculates 11*12=132 instead of 10*12=120. Its subsequent related steps, step 2 and 4, will be affected. Step 2 changes from 120+6=126 to 132+6=138, and step 4 changes from 126-94=32 to 138-94=44. Please note that you should only consider one error, so step 3 still references 6 in the question correctly.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The solution correctly converts the height of the rim and the player's height to inches, adds the necessary reach above the rim, and calculates the required jump height."

        "question": "Building one birdhouse requires 7 planks and 20 nails. If 1 nail costs $0.05, and one plank costs $3, what is the cost, in dollars, to build 4 birdhouses?",
        "original_solution": "The cost of the planks for one birdhouse is 7 * 3 = $21.\nAnd the nails are a cost of 20 * 0.05 = $1 for each birdhouse.\nSo to build one birdhouse one will need 21 + 1 = $22.\nSo the cost of building 4 birdhouses is at 4 * 22 = $88.\n#### 88",
        "original_answer": 88.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The cost of the planks for one birdhouse is 7 * 4 = $28.\nAnd the nails are a cost of 20 * 0.05 = $1 for each birdhouse.\nSo to build one birdhouse one will need 28 + 1 = $29.\nSo the cost of building 4 birdhouses is at 4 * 29 = $116.\n#### 116",
