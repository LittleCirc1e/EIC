        "original_solution": "With 2 tractor teams working for 2 days, this is like 2*2=4 days worth of work by a single tractor, which they call tractor days.\nWith 7 tractor teams working for 3 days, this is 7*3=21 tractor days.\nIn total, the effort of all the tractor teams is 4+21=25 tractor days.\nIf they need to plant 1700 acres with their 25 tractor days, then each tractor team needs to plant 1700/25 = 68 acres of cotton per day.\n#### 68",

Additionally, most experts will say that a player must be able to reach at least 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball.  Suppose a basketball player is 6 feet tall and can reach 22 inches above their head using the wingspan of their arms.  How high must this player be able to jump to reach 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball?",
