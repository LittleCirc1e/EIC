        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the addition of lengths (which gives perimeter) with the multiplication of lengths (which gives area, not applicable for this case since triangle sides are not area). The question requires that the lengths of sides be added, not multiplied, so the original step adding 40+50=90 cm is replaced by 40*50=2000 cm in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 2, changing from 160-90=70 cm to 160-2000=-1840 cm. Note that the language description of step 1 < To get the perimeter, you add all the sides of the triangles > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that only step 1 introduces a confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this case, step 1 mistakenly uses a formula that would calculate area (if applicable) instead of perimeter, while the other calculation processes are still correct.",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter (which involves addition of the sides) and the area (which typically involves multiplying length and width, although for triangles the formula is different, involving a half of base times height). The question requires that the values of two sides be added—since it’s a linear measure of perimeter—resulting in 40+50=90 cm in the original solution. By changing the addition to multiplication (40*50=2000 cm), we make an error reflecting confusion between linear and area measures. This affects the subsequent step 2 (the calculation for the remaining side), changing the correct subtraction from 160-90=70 cm to an incorrect subtraction 160-2000=-1840 cm. Note that while the transformed solution contains the error in step 1, the language description remains unchanged. It is a single error in confusing the formula type while the concept of subtraction in step 2 is applied correctly, but with incorrect values.",
