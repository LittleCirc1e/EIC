        "question": "The size of a bathroom is 96 sq ft. If the width of the bathroom is 8 feet and the owner wants to extend it by 2 feet on each side, what is the new area of the bathroom?",
        "original_solution": "The original length of the bathroom is 96 sq ft/8 ft = 12 ft\nThe new length of the bathroom is 12ft + 2 ft = 14 ft\nThe new width of the bathroom is 8 ft + 2 ft = 10 ft\nThe new area of the bathroom is 14ft x 10 ft = 140 sq ft\n#### 140",
        "original_answer": 140.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The original length of the bathroom is 96 sq ft/8 ft = 12 ft\nThe new length of the bathroom is 12ft + 2 ft + 2 ft = 16 ft\nThe new width of the bathroom is 8 ft + 2 ft + 2 ft = 12 ft\nThe new area of the bathroom is 16ft x 12 ft = 192 sq ft\n#### 192",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, the wrong step involves confusing the process of extending the length and width of the bathroom. In the original solution, we correctly add 2 ft to each side (length and width), which in the context of the problem, should only be a single addition to represent the extension on one side. However, in the transformed solution, the step has been altered to adding 2 ft on each side twice, implying that the length and width are being extended on both sides of each dimension, effectively doubling the intended extension. This mistake alters both the new length and the new width calculations, and thus changes the new area of the bathroom calculation. Note that the language description of step 2 and 3 in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that only this one step has been modified with the confusing formula error, and all the other calculation processes are still correct.",

        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the original length of the bathroom by dividing the area by the width. It then correctly adds 2 feet to each side of the length and width to find the new dimensions. Finally, it correctly calculates the new area by multiplying the new length by the new width. The final answer of 192 sq ft is correct."
