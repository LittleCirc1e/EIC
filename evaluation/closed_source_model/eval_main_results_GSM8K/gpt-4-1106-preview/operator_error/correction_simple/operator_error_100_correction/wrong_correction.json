        "question": "Juan needs 10 half-gallons of milk to bake 40 cookies with. How many half-gallons of milk does Juan need to bake 200 dozen cookies?",
        "original_solution": "If 10 half-gallons of milk bake 40 cookies, then one half-gallon of milk bakes 40/10 = 4 cookies.\nIf one half-gallon of milk bakes 4 cookies. to bake 200 cookies, you'll need 200/4 = 50 half-gallons of milk\n#### 50",
        "original_answer": 50.0,
        "transformed_solution": "If 10 half-gallons of milk bake 40 cookies, then one half-gallon of milk bakes 40*10 = 400 cookies.\nIf one half-gallon of milk bakes 400 cookies. to bake 200 dozen cookies (2400 cookies), you'll need 2400/400 = 6 half-gallons of milk\n#### 6",

        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example changes the division in step 1 into multiplication, modifying 40/10 = 4 to 40*10 = 400. This affects the subsequent step where the quantity of milk required is calculated. Instead of dividing the number of cookies by the correct number of cookies baked per half-gallon, the number of cookies is divided by an incorrectly inflated amount due to the operator change. The calculation within the transformed solution is correct given the modified step, but the transformed solution yields a different answer from the original due to the change in the initial operator.",

        "corrected_solution": "If 10 half-gallons of milk bake 40 cookies, then one half-gallon of milk bakes 40 / 10 = 4 cookies.\nIf one half-gallon of milk bakes 4 cookies, to bake 200 dozen cookies (2400 cookies), you'll need 2400 / 4 = 600 half-gallons of milk.",
        "corrected_answer": 600.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The initial calculation of cookies per half-gallon was incorrect. One half-gallon of milk is used to bake 4 cookies, not 400. Therefore, to bake 2400 cookies, Juan would need 600 half-gallons of milk."

        "question": "Steve's new book sells 1,000,000 copies. He got an advance to pay for 100,000 copies. He gets $2 for each copy of the book sold. His agent takes 10% of that. How much money did he keep not counting the money from the advance?",
        "original_solution": "He sold 1,000,000-100,000=900,000 not counting the advance\nSo he made 900,000*2=$1,800,000 from selling the books\nHis agent took 1,800,000*.1=$180,000\nThat means he kept 1,800,000-180,000=$1,620,000\n#### 1620000",

        "explanation": "This example turns the subtraction in step 1 into addition, and by changing - to +, 1,000,000-100,000=900,000 becomes 1,000,000+100,000=1,100,000. This affects the subsequent related step 2, 3, and 4. Step 2 changes from 900,000*2=$1,800,000 to 1,100,000*2=$2,200,000, step 3 changes from 1,800,000*.1=$180,000 to 2,200,000*.1=$220,000, and step 4 changes from 1,800,000-180,000=$1,620,000 to 2,200,000-220,000=$1,980,000. It should be noted that only the operator in step 1 is incorrect, but its calculation is correct, which leads to its result being incorrect.

        "corrected_explanation": "The advance for 100,000 copies should not be added to the total number of copies sold. The advance is a prepayment for the copies, so we only calculate the earnings from the 1,000,000 copies actually sold. After calculating the agent's 10% commission, the correct amount that Steve keeps is $1,800,000."

Its subsequent step 2 related to it inherits its result, changing 30*2400=72000 to 30*1.5=45.

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly calculated the daily power usage of the bulbs by dividing instead of multiplying the wattage of one bulb by the number of bulbs. The correct calculation involves multiplying the wattage of one bulb (60 watts) by the number of bulbs (40) to find the total daily usage, then multiplying that by the number of days in June (30), and finally multiplying by the cost per watt to find the total cost."
