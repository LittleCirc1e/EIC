        "question": "On Saturdays and Sundays, Suzanne makes french toast for the family. She and her husband each have 1 whole slice and her daughters split 1 slice. She uses a thick sliced bread that comes 12 slices per loaf. Over 52 weeks, how many loaves of bread will she need to make french toast?",
        "original_solution": "She and her husband have 1 slice each and her children split 1 slice so that's 1+1+.5+.5 = 3 slices\nShe makes 3 pieces of french toast on Saturday and Sunday for a total of 3*2 = 6 slices per weekend\nIf she uses 6 slices per weekend then over 52 weeks she will have used 6*52 = 312 slices\nShe gets 12 slices per loaf and she needs 312 slices so she needs 312/12 = 26 loaves\n#### 26",

        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 mistakenly counts the number of times french toast is made per weekend as 1 time instead of 2 times, resulting in the 3*2 calculation for slices per weekend in the original_solution changed to 3*1 in the transformed_solution. This affects the following step where the total number of slices needed for 52 weeks is also halved from 312 to 156. Subsequently, the calculation in the last step is based on this new total, resulting in the transformed_answer being half of the original_answer. This single counting error of the number of times french toast is made per weekend directly leads to the halved result in the final step of the transformed_solution.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "She and her husband have 1 slice each and her daughters split 1 slice so that's 1+1+0.5 = 2.5 slices\nShe makes 2.5 pieces of french toast on Saturday and Sunday for a total of 2.5*2 = 5 slices per weekend\nIf she uses 5 slices per weekend then over 52 weeks she will have used 5*52 = 260 slices\nShe gets 12 slices per loaf and she needs 260 slices so she needs 260/12 = 21.6667 loaves\nSince she can't buy a fraction of a loaf, she needs to buy 22 loaves\n",
        "corrected_answer": 22,
        "corrected_explanation": "The calculation of the total slices needed per weekend was incorrect. Suzanne uses 2.5 slices per day, not 3. Therefore, she uses 5 slices per weekend (2.5 slices on Saturday and 2.5 slices on Sunday). Over 52 weekends, she will use 260 slices in total. Dividing this by the 12 slices per loaf, she would need 21.6667 loaves. Since she can't buy a fraction of a loaf, she needs to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 22 loaves."
