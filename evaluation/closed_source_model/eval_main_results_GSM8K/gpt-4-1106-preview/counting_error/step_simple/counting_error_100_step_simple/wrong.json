        "question": "In a week, 450 cars drove through a toll booth. Fifty vehicles went through the toll booth on Monday and the same number of vehicles drove through the toll booth on Tuesday. On each of Wednesday and Thursday, twice the number of cars that passed through the toll booth on Monday went through the toll booth. If, for the remaining of the days of the week, an equal number of vehicles passed through the toll booth, calculate the total number of cars that passed the toll booth in each of the remaining days.",
        "original_solution": "There were 50+50 = 100 cars that went through the toll booth on Monday and Tuesday.\nOn Wednesday, the number of cars that went through the toll booth is 2*50 = 100.\nThe exact number of cars passed through the toll booth on Thursday as Wednesday, giving a total of 100+100 = 200 vehicles going through the toll booth in the two days.\nThere were 200+100 = 300 cars that passed through the toll booth from Monday to Thursday.\nIf the total number of cars passed through the toll booth in the week was 450, then 450-300 = 150 vehicles went through the toll booth on the remaining days.\nSince there were an equal number of cars in the toll booth on each of the remaining days, there were 150/3 = 50 cars on each day.\n#### 50",
        "original_answer": 50,
        "transformed_solution": "There were 50+50 = 100 cars that went through the toll booth on Monday and Tuesday.\nOn Wednesday, the number of cars that went through the toll booth is 2*50 = 100.\nThe exact number of cars passed through the toll booth on Thursday as Wednesday, giving a total of 100+100 = 200 vehicles going through the toll booth in the two days.\nThere were 200+100 = 300 cars that passed through the toll booth from Monday to Thursday.\nIf the total number of cars passed through the toll booth in the week was 450, then 450-300 = 150 vehicles went through the toll booth on the remaining days.\nSince there were an equal number of cars in the toll booth on each of the remaining days, there were 150/2 = 75 cars on each day.\n#### 75",

        "wrong_step": 6,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 6 erroneously counts the remaining days of the week as 2 days instead of 3 days (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), resulting in 150/3=50 becoming 150/2=75. It should be noted that only the division in step 6 is affected, and not the computations in the previous steps, which remain correct.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_step": "none",
        "step_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the number of cars that went through the toll booth from Monday to Thursday and then subtracts this from the total number of cars for the week to find the number of cars for the remaining days. It then correctly divides this number by the number of remaining days (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) to find the number of cars that went through the toll booth on each of these days."
