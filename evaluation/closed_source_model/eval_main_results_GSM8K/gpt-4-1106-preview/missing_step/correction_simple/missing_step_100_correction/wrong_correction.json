        "question": "Daisy is a poodle puppy who loves to play with her dog toys. She often loses them in various ways, and her owner needs to replace them. On Monday, Daisy played with 5 dog toys. On Tuesday, Daisy had 3 dog toys left after losing some, and her owner went to the store and got her 3 more. On Wednesday, all of Daisy's old and new dog toys were missing, so her owner went to the store and bought her 5 more. If Daisy's owner found all the lost dog toys, including the new dog toys, how many dog toys would Daisy have now?",
        "original_solution": "Daisy originally had 5 dog toys on Monday + 3 more her owner bought her on Tuesday = 8 dog toys.\nOn Wednesday Daisy's owner bought her 5 more dog toys + 8 old ones = 13 total dog toys if none were lost.\n#### 13",
        "original_answer": 13.0,

        "explanation": "Removing step 1 entirely which originally added the 5 original toys to the 3 new toys bought on Tuesday, we need to directly add the new toys bought on Wednesday to the total original toys mentioned in the question which is 5. This makes the calculation now 5 (original toys) + 5 (new toys on Wednesday) instead of 8 (from previous step 1) + 5 (new toys on Wednesday). Subsequently, subsequent steps that would have referenced the 8 now reference the 5. It results in a new total of 5+5=10 dog toys if none were lost, which is different from the original answer, and complies with the requirement that the transformed_solution should have one less step compared to the original_solution. The first transformed step that refers to the error is the new step 1, which in this case is the first and only step.",

        "question": "Joseph had socks of many different colors. His dresser drawer was filled to overflowing with red, blue, black, and white socks. Uncertain of how many pairs he had of each color, he began to sort his socks. He discovered that he had three more pairs of blue socks than he had pairs of black socks. He had one less pair of red socks than he had pairs of white socks. He had twice as many blue socks as he had of red socks. And he counted a total of 6 red socks. What is the total number of Joseph's socks?",
        "original_solution": "Starting with 6 red socks, twice the number of blue socks as red meant Joseph had 2*6=12 blue socks.\nWith one less pair of red socks than white socks, this meant 2 fewer red socks than white, for a total of 6-2=4 white socks.\nAlso, 12 blue socks=6 pairs of blue socks.\nWith three more pairs of blue socks than pairs of black socks, this means he had 6-3=3 pairs of black socks.\nAnd three pairs of black socks corresponds to 3*2=6 black socks.\nThus, in total, he had 6+12+4+6=28 socks.\n#### 28",

After deleting this step, step 5 instantaneously refers to the number of blue socks pairs by dividing by 2 (since 1 pair equals 2 socks), which changes the formula from 6-3=3 pairs of black socks to 6/2-3=0 pairs of black socks. The change leads to calculating 0 black socks instead of 6, and the remaining steps that calculate the total number of socks refer to this new value. Therefore, removing step 4 causes a fundamental miscalculation in the number of black socks, leading to the first erroneous reference at step 5 in the transformed solution. It should be noted that the number 3 from step 5, referring to how many fewer pairs of black socks there are compared to blue, remains intact as the required reference from the question.

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly calculated the number of white and black socks. The number of pairs of red socks is given by the total red socks divided by 2, which is 6/2=3 pairs of red socks. Since he has one less pair of red socks than white socks, he has 3+1=4 pairs of white socks. The number of blue socks is twice the number of red socks, which is 6 pairs of blue socks. Since he has three more pairs of blue socks than black socks, he has 6-3=3 pairs of black socks. The total number of socks is the sum of all individual socks, which is 6 red + 12 blue + 8 white + 6 black = 32 socks."
