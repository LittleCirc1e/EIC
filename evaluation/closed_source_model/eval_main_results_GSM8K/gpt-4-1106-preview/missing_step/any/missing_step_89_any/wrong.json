        "original_solution": "Liam's age two years ago was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.\nVince's age two years ago was 14/2 = 7 years old because Liam's age is twice his.\nSo Vince age now is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.\n#### 9",

        "transformed_solution": "Vince's age two years ago was 16/2 = 8 years old because Liam's age is twice his.\nSo Vince's age now is 8 + 2 = 10 years old.\n#### 10",

        "explanation": "In the original_solution, step 1 calculates Liam’s age two years ago. However, the transformed_solution removes this first step. As a consequence, step 1 in the transformed_solution, which originally is step 2 in the original_solution, directly references the number 16 from the question, which leads to Vince’s age being half of 16 instead of half of Liam’s age two years ago. This results in a transformed answer of 10, which is incorrect. The error in the new step 1 is due to the fact that it incorrectly calculates Vince’s age as half of Liam’s current age rather than half of Liam’s age two years ago. Since the original step 1 is absent, the subsequent related step (the new step 1) becomes the wrong step.",

Since step 1 was deleted, we start from step 2 in the transformed_solution, which is a combination of step 1 and step 3 from the original solution.

        "original_solution": "Ellis and her family of 4 will be traveling for 8 hours going and 8 hours coming home = 16 hours total.\nEach person needs 1/2 a bottle of water each hour, so 1/2 a bottle x 16 hours = 8 bottles.\nThere are 4 people traveling so 8 total water bottles for each person x 4 people = 32 total water bottles.\n#### 32",

The modified equation calculates the number of bottles for one trip which is then doubled for the round trip.
