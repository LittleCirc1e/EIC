        "explanation": "Step 3 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement, specifically an auction fee that is 10% of the cost of the next piece of art, resulting in an additional calculation 22,500*.1=$2,250 being integrated into the existing text. This affects the final total cost calculation, changing it from $45,000 + $22,500 = $67,500 in the original_solution to $45,000 + $22,500 + $2,250 = $69,750 in the transformed_solution.
