        "original_solution": "On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday she works 8 hours/day, so in total 8 * 3 = 24 hours\nOn Tuesday and Thursday she works 6 hours/day, so in total 6 * 2 = 12 hours\nThe total hours she works in a week is 24 + 12 = 36 hours\nTo find her hourly wage, we divide her weekly earnings by the total hours worked, 504 / 36 = 14\n#### 14",

The subsequent step 3 and 4 that rely on the total hours are affected: step 3 changes from 24 + 12 = 36 hours to 16 + 12 = 28 hours, and step 4 changes from 504 / 36 = 14 to 504 / 28 = 18.

Since 50% of the trucks were returned by Saturday morning, this means 13 trucks were still out. To find the maximum number of different trucks rented out, we need to find the minimum number of trucks rented out and returned. If 13 trucks were still out on Saturday morning, then the minimum number of trucks rented out and returned is 13. Therefore, the maximum number of different trucks that could have been rented out during the week is 26 - 13 = 13."
