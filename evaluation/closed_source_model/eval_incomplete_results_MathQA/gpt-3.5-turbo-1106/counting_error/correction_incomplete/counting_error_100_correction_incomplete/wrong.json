        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 mistakenly changes the percentage of counties with no rain from 25% to 20%, resulting in the inequality changing from 60 + 65 - x = 100 - 25 to 60 + 65 - x = 100 - 20. Consequently, the final answer is affected, and the correct percentage of counties that received rain on both Monday and Tuesday changes from 50% to 45%. The wrong step introduces a single counting error in the problem-solving process, but the arithmetic to solve for x is still carried out correctly after the error.",
