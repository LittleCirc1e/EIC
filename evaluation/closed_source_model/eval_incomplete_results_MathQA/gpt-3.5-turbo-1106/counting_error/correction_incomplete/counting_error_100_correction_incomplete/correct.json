This leads to the total hours served from Monday to Friday being 64 instead of 80, and the total number of cars served from Monday to Friday is calculated incorrectly as 9 cars/hour * 64 hours = 576 cars. This changes the overall total in step 4 from 224 + 160 + 720 = 1104 to 224 + 160 + 576 = 960.

So the total number of cars served on Saturdays is 14 cars/hour * 16 hours = 224 cars\nOn Sundays, the station serves cars for 16 hours. So the total number of cars served on Sundays is 10 cars/hour * 16 hours = 160 cars\nFrom Monday to Friday, the station serves cars for 16 hours/day * 5 days = 80 hours. The total number of cars served from Monday to Friday is 9 cars/hour * 80 hours = 720 cars\n",

The correct calculation for the total number of cars served over the course of a typical week is 224 (Saturday) + 160 (Sunday) + 720 (Monday to Friday) = 1104 cars."
