        "explanation": "Here, step 4 confuses the area and perimeter of triangle. The question requires that the area of the triangle to be solved be equal to the base multiplied by height divided by 2, rather than the sum of the sides of the triangle, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the triangle, resulting in (3 * 4) / 2 = 6 square units in the original_solution becoming (3 + 4 + 5) = 12 units in the transformed_solution. This does not affect any previous steps because they all correctly calculate the height using the Pythagorean theorem. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 4 mistakenly replaces the formula for triangle area with the formula for triangle perimeter, while the other calculation processes are still correct.",

The perimeter of a square is given by 4 times the side length, while the area is given by the side squared. Thus, in the transformed solution, the calculation of the actual area of the square is mistakenly changed from x^2 to 4*x, the formula for the perimeter. This in turn affects step 4, changing the calculation of the area with the error from (1.04x)^2 to simply 4*1.04x, and this will affect the final error percentage calculation in step 5. We have to recalculate the error percentage based on the incorrect area calculation, yielding a transformed answer of 4%. Note that the language description of step 3 in the original solution <The actual area of the square is > remains unchanged in the transformed solution. The other steps related to calculation in the transformed solution are adjusted accordingly to maintain logical coherence after the initial error.",
