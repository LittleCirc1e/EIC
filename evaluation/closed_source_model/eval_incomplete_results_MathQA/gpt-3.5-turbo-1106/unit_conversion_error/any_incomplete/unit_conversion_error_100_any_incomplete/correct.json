        "question": "A leak in the bottom of a tank can empty the full tank in 6 hours. An inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute. When the tank is full, the inlet is opened and due to the leak, the tank is empty in 12 hours. How many litres does the cistern hold?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the capacity of the tank in litres.\nThe inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute, so in 12 hours it fills 6 * 12 * 60 = 4320 litres.\nThe leak can empty the tank in 6 hours, so in 12 hours it can empty 2x litres.\nNow, 4320 - 2x = x. Solving for x, we get x = 4320.\n#### 4320",
        "original_answer": 4320.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the capacity of the tank in litres.\nThe inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute, so in 12 hours it fills 6 * 12 * 50 = 3600 litres.\n",
        "transformed_answer": 1200.0,
        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means that 1 hour wrongly has 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes, resulting in 6 * 12 * 60 = 4320 litres in the original_solution becoming 6 * 12 * 50 = 3600 litres in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 4, which changes from 4320 - 2x = x to 3600 - 2x = x and the solution from x = 4320 to x = 3600 / 3 = 1200 litres for the capacity of the tank. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, so the other calculation processes related to the rate of the leak are still correct.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "any_explanation": "The calculation for the capacity of the tank is missing from the solution."
