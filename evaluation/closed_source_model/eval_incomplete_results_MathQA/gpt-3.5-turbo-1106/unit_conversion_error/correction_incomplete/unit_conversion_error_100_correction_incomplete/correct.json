        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes an incorrect unit conversion, changing the denominator for converting kilometers per hour to meters per second from 3600 seconds (correct value representing the number of seconds in an hour) to 3000 seconds, which results in an increased speed from 14.16667 m/s to 17 m/s in the transformed_solution. This mistake then affects the subsequent related step 2, which changes the final answer from 425 meters in the original_solution to 510 meters in the transformed_solution.
