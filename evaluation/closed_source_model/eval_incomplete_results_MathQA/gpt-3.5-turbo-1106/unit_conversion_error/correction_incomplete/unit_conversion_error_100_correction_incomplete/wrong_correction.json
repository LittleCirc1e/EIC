        "corrected_explanation": "The correct capacity of the tank is 7200 litres. The inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute, so in 12 hours it fills 6 * 12 * 60 = 4320 litres. The leak empties the tank in 12 hours, so the net outflow rate is 4320 - 3600 = 720 litres. Therefore, the capacity of the tank is 4320 + 720 = 7200 litres."
