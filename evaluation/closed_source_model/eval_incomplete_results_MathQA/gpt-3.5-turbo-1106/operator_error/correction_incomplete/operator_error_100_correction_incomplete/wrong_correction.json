        "question": "In a mixed college 160 students are there in one class. Out of these 160 students, 1/2 are girls. How many boys are there?",
        "original_solution": "There are 160 x 1/2 = 80 girls in the class.\nThere are 160 - 80 = 80 boys in the class.\n#### 80",
        "original_answer": 80.0,
        "transformed_solution": "There are 160 / 1/2 = 320 girls in the class.\n",
        "transformed_answer": -160.0,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this example, the multiplication operator in step 1 has been changed to division, thus incorrectly calculating the number of girls as 160 / 1/2 = 320 instead of 160 x 1/2 = 80. This results in an impossible count of boys, calculated in step 2 as 160 - 320 = -160, which is not a feasible number of students. The original count was 80 boys, so the transformation caused by the operator error in step 1 led to a nonsensical answer. Every step's calculation is correct except for the incorrect application of the operator in step 1.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "none",
        "corrected_answer": "320",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution is incorrect because the calculation 160 / 1/2 is incorrect. The correct calculation should be 160 * 1/2 = 80, so there are 80 girls in the class. To find the number of boys, subtract 80 from 160, which gives 80 boys."
