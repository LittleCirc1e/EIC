        "explanation": "The first step 'Let x be the greatest number.' has been removed. Since step 1 often references a concept or introduces a variable and doesn't involve calculations, deleting it should not affect subsequent steps' calculations. The subsequent steps originally referencing result x should not change. However, the calculation to find the greatest number x has been modified to involve finding the GCD of the differences between given numbers, instead of the GCD of numbers themselves, based on the property that if numbers leave the same remainder when divided by x, their differences also should be divisible by x. Thus, we calculate the GCD of (62-25), (105-62), and (105-25) instead, which results in a GCD of 37. This is a logical modification of the solution rather than an erroneous step. Despite the deletion of step 1, the calculation remains valid, and the transformed answer is different from the original answer. Therefore, the wrong_step is marked as 1, referencing the first modified computational step in the transformed_solution.",

After deleting step 1, the speed value used in step 2 should be the raw speed from the question, which is 72 km/hr. However, instead of directly using the speed in km/hr (which would be incorrect as the units must match), the speed is mistakenly changed to 72 m/s (a much higher speed), which results in an incorrect conversion and impacts the formula in step 2. This change wrongly modifies the original formula \"280 m / 20 m/s\" to \"280 m / 72 m/s,\" resulting in an incorrect time calculation of 3.89 seconds. This is calculated by dividing the distance by the incorrect speed, instead of converting the speed to the correct unit (m/s) before performing the calculation. Since the transformed_solution references an incorrect value right from the beginning, wrong_step is 1.",

The modified solution skips the calculation of Shekhar's current age and refers directly to his age after 6 years, which is 26. Since step 1 references a number from the question (Shekhar's age after 6 years), the subsequent step that references the result of step 1 now refers back to the age of Shekhar after 6 years instead. As the next step originally multiplied Shekhar's current age by (3/4) to get Shobha's current age, the transformation led to 26 * (3/4), the largest number provided by the context of the original step 1. This is an error because the age after 6 years was used instead of the current age, giving an inflated number for Shobha's age. It is the first step in the transformed_solution, which references the incorrect number (26 years after 6 years), so the wrong_step is 1.",

Step 3 references the result 20x from step 2. After deleting step 1, step 3 is adjusted to reference 20(x-2) from the new first step and changes the formula from 20x = 22x - 44 to 20x - 40 = 22x - 44.
