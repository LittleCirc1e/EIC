        "original_solution": "The number of games played by one team is 15-1 = 14 because each team plays each of the other teams once.\nThe total number of games played is 15 x 14 / 2 = 105 because in a complete round-robin tournament, each team plays a game against every other team once.\n#### 105",
        "original_answer": 105.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total number of games played is 15 x 15 / 2 = 112.5 because in a complete round-robin tournament, each team plays a game against every other team once, but here we erroneously count each team playing itself once.\n",

        "wrong_type": "missing_step",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 has been removed. In the original_solution, step 1 references the numbers 15 and 1 from the question and step 2 references the result 14 of step 1 to calculate the total number of games. After deleting step 1, the calculation in step 2 changes to directly use the number 15 from the question, mistakenly assuming each team plays itself once, without subtracting 1. Therefore, the formula has been adjusted from 15 x (15-1) / 2 to 15 x 15 / 2, yielding an incorrect total of 112.5 games. The wrong_step is 1 because it is the first step in the transformed_solution and references the incorrect assumption that each team plays itself once.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "any_explanation": "The solution is incorrect because the formula used to calculate the total number of games is incorrect. It should be 15 x 14 / 2 = 105, as each team plays against 14 other teams."
