Consequently, step 2 should reference the result from the question, which is 50 doughnuts equivalent to 5 parts. The reference to each part being equivalent to 10 still holds as the calculation method is correct, but since we consider there to be 10 parts of muffins instead of 1, step 2 should be modified to reflect a 1:1 part ratio between doughnuts and muffins. Given there are 50 doughnuts, the calculation changes to 50 x 1 = 50 for the number of muffins, which should ultimately modify the formula to 50 x 1 = 50. It should be noted that the calculation in step 3 maintains the error and refers incorrectly to '10 parts of muffins', as the initial step that created the incorrect carryover effect from the deletion is step 1, thus it is marked as the wrong_step. The transformed_solution erroneously states that there are 100 muffins due to incorrectly maintaining the original step 4 calculation without adjusting for the altered quantity suggested by the deleted step 1 (10 parts was used instead of the correct 1 part, leading to multiplying by 10 instead of 1).",

As a result, the solution should have used the result of step 2 in the subsequent steps. However, in the transformed_solution step 3 incorrectly refers to the amount from the question (20 kgs) and references 0.25 directly from the question instead of the correct 0.15 resulting from the step 1 formula (0.15x for the amount of dry grapes in x kgs of fresh grapes) which should be 0.15x = 15, not 0.25x = 15 as the transformed_solution suggests. This results in the transformed_answer being 15 / 0.15 + 5 (weight of water in raisins) = 133.33, a different value from the original_answer 100, due to an incorrect removal of step 2 and incorrect reference in step 3.",
