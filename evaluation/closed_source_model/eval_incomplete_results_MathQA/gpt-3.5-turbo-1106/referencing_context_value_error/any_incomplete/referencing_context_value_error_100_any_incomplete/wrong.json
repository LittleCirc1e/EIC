        "explanation": "Step 1 references 20 in the question as 25 wrongly, thus changing the first equation to x + y = 25 instead of the original x + y = 20. This affects the subsequent calculation directly related to this step: the substitution step results in 2(25 - y) = 3y + 5 instead of the correct 2(20 - y) = 3y + 5. The transformed_answer becomes 16 and 9, different from the original_answer, but the operations performed after the erroneous step are done correctly. Each step that requires the sum of the numbers still references the number 20 correctly, except for the step referenced incorrectly.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The solution correctly sets up the equations to solve for the two numbers."
