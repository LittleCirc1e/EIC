        "question": "Maxwell leaves his home and walks toward Brad's house at the same time that Brad leaves his home and runs toward Maxwell's house. If the distance between their homes is 36 kilometers, Maxwell's walking speed is 3 km/h, and Brad's running speed is 6 km/h. What is the distance traveled by Maxwell when they meet in the middle?",

        "explanation": "In this example, the addition in the original equation 6t + 3t = 36 was changed to subtraction, making it 6t - 3t = 36. The subtraction led to a new equation, 3t = 36, with t being incorrectly calculated to satisfy the incorrect equation. This results in a wrong time of t=12, which affects the subsequent calculation of Maxwell's distance. The correct calculation of step 5 becomes 3t = 36, giving t = 12, and step 6 then multiplies Maxwell’s speed by this incorrect time to get a final incorrect result of 36 kilometers. All other steps have been correctly calculated based on the modified values.",
