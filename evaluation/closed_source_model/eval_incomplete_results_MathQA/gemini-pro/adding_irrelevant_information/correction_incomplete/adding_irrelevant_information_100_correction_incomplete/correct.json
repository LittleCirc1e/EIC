Multiplying both sides by 2, we get 5a + 8 = 2x. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 5a = 2x - 8. Dividing both sides by 5, we get a = (2x - 8) / 5. Since the average of 2a + 16 and 3a - 8 is 94, we have (2a + 16 + 3a - 8) / 2 = 94. Substituting a = (2x - 8) / 5 into this equation, we get [(2 * (2x - 8) / 5) + 16 + 3 * (2x - 8) / 5 - 8] / 2 = 94. Simplifying this equation, we get (4x - 16 + 16 + 6x - 24 - 8) / 2 = 94. Combining like terms, we get (10x - 32) / 2 = 94. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get 10x - 32 = 188. Adding 32 to both sides, we get 10x = 220. Dividing both sides by 10, we get x = 22. Therefore, a = (2 * 22 - 8) / 5 = 36.",
