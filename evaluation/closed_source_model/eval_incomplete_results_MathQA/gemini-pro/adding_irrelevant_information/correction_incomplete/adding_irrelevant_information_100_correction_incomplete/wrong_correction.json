        "original_solution": "The profit per item is $15 - $10 = $5\nThe manufacturer needs to earn $150,000 + $130,000 = $280,000 in total revenue\nThe number of items to sell is $280,000 / $5 = 56,000\n#### 56000",

        "transformed_solution": "The profit per item is $15 - $10 = $5\nThe manufacturer needs to earn $150,000 + $130,000 = $280,000 in total revenue to cover fixed costs and desired profit. However, there is an unanticipated additional cost of $2 per item for improved packaging.\n",

        "explanation": "Step 2 integrates additional information that is not mentioned in the question statement, specifically an <unanticipated additional cost of $2 per item for improved packaging>, which was not part of the original cost structure. This impacts the profit per item calculation and the total number of items needed to be sold to reach the target profit, changing the original step from a division of $280,000 by $5 to a division by $3 due to the altered profit per item. The result changes the required number of items from 56,000 in the original_solution to 93,334 in the transformed_solution. Therefore, the calculation process after the altered step remains correct, but the final result is impacted by only this single error.",

        "corrected_answer": 136666.67,
        "corrected_explanation": "The corrected solution first calculates the profit per item, then calculates the total revenue needed to cover fixed costs and desired profit. It then takes into account the additional cost of $2 per item for improved packaging. Finally, it sets up an equation to solve for the number of items that need to be produced and sold to earn the desired profit."
