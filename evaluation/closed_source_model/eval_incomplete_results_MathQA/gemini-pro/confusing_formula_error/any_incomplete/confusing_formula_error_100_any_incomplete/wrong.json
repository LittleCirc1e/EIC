The question requires that the area of the triangle to be solved be equal to (1/2) * base * height, rather than base + height + sqrt(base^2 + height^2), which is equivalent to calculating the perimeter of a right-angled triangle, resulting in the original solution (1/2) * 8 * 8 = 32 being changed to 8 + 8 + sqrt(8^2 + 8^2) ≈ 27.31 in the transformed_solution.
