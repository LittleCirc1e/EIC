The identification of 'x' as the smaller integer in the original solution is skipped, and instead, the larger integer is directly set to 3, which is derived from the cubic root of the difference provided in the question. Since the first step is removed, all further steps reference the larger integer directly without considering the actual value of x. The wrong_step 1 in the transformed_solution is also the first step in the original_solution, which originally dealt with the correct identification of the smaller integer x. Since the error starts from step 1 in the transformed_solution and is due to missing step 1 in the original_solution, it is identified as the wrong_step.

Simplifying, we get 9x^2 + 27x - 162 = 0. Factoring, we get (9x - 18)(x + 9) = 0. Therefore, x = 2 or x = -2. Since x is a positive integer, x = 2. Therefore, the larger integer is 2 + 3 = 5.

Hence, in step 5, instead of equating -780 to 390, it should equate -780 to 780 to maintain this balance. Step 6 then incorrectly solves for x by dividing 780 by 2, which yields the incorrect answer of x = 390. The wrong_step is 2 because that is the first step in the transformed solution that incorrectly references the result of the deleted step (step 2 in the original solution).",

        "corrected_solution": "Let x be the actual number of children in the school.\nTotal bananas distributed = 2x\nEach child got two extra bananas, so the total extra bananas distributed = 2(x-390)\nTherefore, 2x = 2(x-390) + 390*2\nSolve for x.",
        "corrected_answer": 1170.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The total number of bananas distributed is equal to the number of children multiplied by the number of bananas each child gets. Since each child got two extra bananas, the total number of extra bananas distributed is equal to the number of children minus the number of absent children multiplied by two. Therefore, we can set up the equation 2x = 2(x-390) + 390*2 and solve for x to find the actual number of children in the school."

The original step references the number 9.25 from the question and the division is performed accordingly to determine the cost price per meter. By changing the divisor from 9.25 to 9 (a number smaller than 9.25), the formula becomes 434.75 / 9, resulting in the incorrect transformed answer.
