Consequently, step 2 should reference the result from the question, which is 50 doughnuts equivalent to 5 parts. The reference to each part being equivalent to 10 still holds as the calculation method is correct, but since we consider there to be 10 parts of muffins instead of 1, step 2 should be modified to reflect a 1:1 part ratio between doughnuts and muffins. Given there are 50 doughnuts, the calculation changes to 50 x 1 = 50 for the number of muffins, which should ultimately modify the formula to 50 x 1 = 50. It should be noted that the calculation in step 3 maintains the error and refers incorrectly to '10 parts of muffins', as the initial step that created the incorrect carryover effect from the deletion is step 1, thus it is marked as the wrong_step. The transformed_solution erroneously states that there are 100 muffins due to incorrectly maintaining the original step 4 calculation without adjusting for the altered quantity suggested by the deleted step 1 (10 parts was used instead of the correct 1 part, leading to multiplying by 10 instead of 1).",

In the original_solution, step 3 references the result of step 2, and steps 4 and 5 reference the result of step 3.

Step 4 and 5, as subsequent related steps, are affected by the modification in step 3.

The formula used in the transformed solution step 1 is (100 - 20) * (100 - 10) / 100 which equals to 72, not calculating the total decrease percentage directly but resulting in the final value instead. In step 2, it mistakenly subtracts 72 from 100, which would imply that the card was somehow back to its original value and then decreased by 28% in two steps which does not make sense. The result of step 2 of the transformed solution should have been a reduced value, not a percentage. This has led to a transformed answer of 72, which is the percentage of the value remaining after the decreases, not the total percent decrease which is asked in the question, resulting in an incorrect transformed_answer. The correct transformed solution should maintain the correct calculation for the total percent decrease, and the wrong step is 1 because it puts forward a calculation with no context and a mistaken interpretation of the final value as the percent decrease.",

The removal of step 1 involves changing step 3 so that instead of subtracting the results of step 1 and step 2 from 210, only the result of step 2 (sixes) is subtracted. This changes the wording to 'He scored 210 - 48 = 162 runs by running between the wickets and boundaries' instead of '210 - 12 - 48'. The calculation in step 4 is then altered to use 162 instead of 150, changing '(150 / 210) x 100' to '(162 / 210) x 100', which results in a percentage of 77.14 instead of 71.4.

However, instead of directly using the speed in km/hr (which would be incorrect as the units must match), the speed is mistakenly changed to 72 m/s (a much higher speed), which results in an incorrect conversion and impacts the formula in step 2. This change wrongly modifies the original formula \"280 m / 20 m/s\" to \"280 m / 72 m/s,\" resulting in an incorrect time calculation of 3.89 seconds.
