        "explanation": "In this transformed example, step 7 erroneously calculates 129024 / 252 as 500 instead of the correct 512. This error affects the final answer (step 8) causing the cubed root of 500 to be computed as 7.94 instead of the correct cubed root of 512 which is 8. All previous steps remain unchanged, and only the modified step and the direct calculation that follows are affected by this single calculation error.",

The corrected solution is to find the cube root of 129024 / 252, which is 8, and then use this value to find the width of the wall."
