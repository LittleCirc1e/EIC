This error leads to step 8, where the calculation will also be wrong, resulting in an incorrect total income (x = 160). The rest of the steps which are not dependent on step 7 remain correct.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Let x be the total income.\nIncome deposited as provident fund = x * 1/16\nIncome remaining after provident fund deposit = x - x * 1/16 = x * 15/16\nIncome deposited as insurance premium = (x * 15/16) * 1/15 = x/16\nBalance after insurance premium = x * 15/16 - x/16 = x * 14/16\nAmount spent on domestic needs = x * 14/16 * 5/7 = x * 35/56\nBalance after domestic needs = x * 14/16 - x * 35/56 = x * 49/56\nBalance after depositing Rs. 50 in the bank = x * 49/56 + 50\nEquating this to the total income, we get:\nx * 49/56 + 50 = x\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 50 * 56/1\n#### x = 2800",
        "corrected_answer": 2800,
        "corrected_explanation": "The mistake in the original solution is that it incorrectly calculated the amount spent on domestic needs. It multiplied the balance after insurance premium by 5/7 instead of the balance after provident fund deposit. The corrected solution correctly calculates the amount spent on domestic needs and then finds the total income by equating the balance after depositing Rs. 50 in the bank to the total income."

To find out how many seconds it takes for gear r to make 6 more revolutions than gear l, we can set up a proportion:\n\n20 revolutions / 1 minute = 6 revolutions / x minutes\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = (6 revolutions * 1 minute) / 20 revolutions\nx = 0.3 minutes\n\nConverting 0.3 minutes to seconds, we get:\n\nx = 0.3 minutes * 60 seconds/minute\nx = 18 seconds\n\nTherefore, it takes 18 seconds for gear r to make 6 more revolutions than gear l.",
        "corrected_answer": 18,
        "corrected_explanation": "The corrected solution sets up a proportion to find the time it takes for gear r to make 6 more revolutions than gear l. The proportion is based on the fact that gear r makes 20 more revolutions than gear l in one minute. The corrected solution then solves for x, which represents the time in minutes it takes for gear r to make 6 more revolutions than gear l. Finally, the corrected solution converts the time from minutes to seconds to get the final answer of 18 seconds."
