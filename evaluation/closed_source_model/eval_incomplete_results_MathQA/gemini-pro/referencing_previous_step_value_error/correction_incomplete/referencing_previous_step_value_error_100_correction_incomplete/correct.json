The first equation is h + c = 48, which represents the fact that the total number of heads is 48. The second equation is 2h + 4c = 140, which represents the fact that the total number of feet is 140. The solution then solves the first equation for h, resulting in h = 48 - c. This expression is then substituted into the second equation, resulting in 2(48 - c) + 4c = 140. The equation is simplified and combined, resulting in 2c = 44. Dividing both sides by 2, we get c = 22. Substituting c = 22 back into the first equation, we get h + 22 = 48, which is solved for h to get h = 26. Therefore, the number of hens is 26."
