        "question": "sheila works 8 hours per day on monday, wednesday and friday, and 6 hours per day on tuesday and thursday. she does not work on saturday and sunday. she earns $504 per week. how much does she earn in dollars per hour?",
        "original_solution": "On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday she works 8 hours/day, so in total 8 * 3 = 24 hours\nOn Tuesday and Thursday she works 6 hours/day, so in total 6 * 2 = 12 hours\nThe total hours she works in a week is 24 + 12 = 36 hours\nTo find her hourly wage, we divide her weekly earnings by the total hours worked, 504 / 36 = 14\n#### 14",
        "original_answer": 14.0,
        "transformed_solution": "On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday she works 8 hours/day, so in total 8 * 2 = 16 hours\n",

        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The mistake happens in step 1 where it counts Monday, Wednesday, and Friday as 2 days instead of 3 days, resulting in 8 * 3 = 24 hours becoming 8 * 2 = 16 hours. The subsequent step 3 and 4 that rely on the total hours are affected: step 3 changes from 24 + 12 = 36 hours to 16 + 12 = 28 hours, and step 4 changes from 504 / 36 = 14 to 504 / 28 = 18. It should be noted that only the counting in step 1 is incorrect; the other calculation processes thereafter are still correct.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday she works 8 hours/day, so in total 8 * 3 = 24 hours. On Tuesday and Thursday she works 6 hours/day, so in total 6 * 2 = 12 hours. In total she works 24 + 12 = 36 hours per week. She earns $504 per week, so she earns $504 / 36 = $14 per hour.",
        "corrected_answer": 14,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly calculated the total number of hours she works per week. It should be 24 hours for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and 12 hours for Tuesday and Thursday, for a total of 36 hours per week."

        "original_solution": "The total number of toys produced per week is 5500 toys\nThe total number of days worked per week is 4 days\nThe number of toys produced each day is 5500 / 4 = 1375 toys\n#### 1375",

        "explanation": "The second step in the transformed_solution incorrectly states that the total number of days worked per week is 5 days instead of the original 4 days from the original_solution. This counting error directly impacts the third step, changing it from a correct division of 5500 toys by 4 days to an incorrect division of 5500 toys by 5 days, leading to a different value of toys produced each day (1100 instead of 1375). It is important to note that only the number of days counted is changed, leaving the previous and unrelated steps unaffected as well as ensuring that the transformed_answer (1100) is different from the original_answer (1375).",

        "corrected_answer": 1375,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution is incorrect because it incorrectly states that the workers work 5 days a week when the question states that they work 4 days a week.

        "original_solution": "The total number of trucks rented out during the week is 26 - 14 = 12 trucks\nSince 50% of the rented out trucks were returned by Saturday morning, the total number of trucks rented out during the week is 12 / (50/100) = 24 trucks\n#### 24",

        "corrected_answer": 24,
        "corrected_explanation": "The question asks for the greatest number of different trucks that could have been rented out during the week, so we need to consider the case where all the trucks that were rented out were returned to the lot on or before Saturday morning of that week. In this case, the total number of trucks rented out during the week would be 26 - 14 = 12 trucks. Since 50% of the trucks that were rented out during the week were returned to the lot on or before Saturday morning of that week, the greatest number of different trucks that could have been rented out during the week is 12 * 2 = 24 trucks."
