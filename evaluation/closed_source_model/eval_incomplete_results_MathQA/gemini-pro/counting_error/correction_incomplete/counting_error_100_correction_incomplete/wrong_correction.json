        "explanation": "Here, step 1 erroneously counts Monday through Thursday as 3 days instead of 4 days, changing 48*4=192 to 48*3=144. This affects the subsequent step because the total temperature from Tuesday through Thursday was recalculated, resulting in 144 minus the temperature on Monday (44), which is equal to 100 degrees. Hence the following steps are modified to maintain logical coherence, and ultimately the temperature on Friday changes from the original result of 36 degrees to a transformed result of 38 degrees. It should be noted that this single counting error affects all related subsequent steps whereas previous and unrelated steps remain unaffected.",
