        "original_solution": "The area of the towel is decreased by 36% because 20% + 20% + (20% x 20%) = 36%\n#### 36%",
        "original_answer": 36.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The area of the towel is decreased by 44% because 20% + 20% + (20% x 20%) = 44%\n",

        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "By randomly changing the calculation result of one step in the original_solution, the percentage decrease of area was incorrectly altered to 44% instead of the correct 36%. This was done by directly changing the total percentage value without modifying the operands or the operators. The subsequent related steps and the final transformed_answer are influenced by this new incorrect percentage.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "The original area is the product of length and breadth. After losing 20% of the length and 20% of the breadth, the new area is the product of 80% of the original length and 80% of the original breadth. So, the new area is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 or 64% of the original area. The decrease is therefore 100% - 64% = 36%",
        "corrected_answer": 0.36,
        "corrected_explanation": "To calculate the percentage decrease in area, we need to consider that area is a two-dimensional measure that depends on both length and breadth. A 20% decrease in each dimension does not simply add up, but rather multiplies together. The correct calculation is (1 - 0.2) * (1 - 0.2) = 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, which is 64% of the original area. Therefore, the decrease is 100% - 64% = 36%"
