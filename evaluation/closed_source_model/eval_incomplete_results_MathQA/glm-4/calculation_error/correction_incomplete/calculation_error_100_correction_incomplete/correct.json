Since we can't travel a fraction of a quarter mile, we need to round down to the nearest whole number of additional quarters, which is 20. The maximum distance is then the sum of the first quarter and the additional quarters: 1 + 20 = 21 quarters. So, the maximum distance is 21 * 0.25 = 5.25 miles.
