This single error affects all subsequent steps that rely on it. As a result, step 5 becomes 3a = 14 rather than 3a = 12, and consequently in step 6, the value of a is incorrectly calculated using the wrong 3a value, giving a = 14 / 3 instead of 4. This error flows through to step 7, 8 and 9, where the value of b and the total number of people are calculated based on this incorrect number of associate professors a.
