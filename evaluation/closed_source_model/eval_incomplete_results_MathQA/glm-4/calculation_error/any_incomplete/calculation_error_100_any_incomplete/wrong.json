        "original_solution": "Let x be the revenues in 1998.\nThe profits in 1998 were 0.1x.\nThe revenues in 1999 were 0.7x because they fell by 30 percent.\nThe profits in 1999 were 0.1 * 0.7x = 0.07x.\nThe profits in 1999 were 70 percent of the profits in 1998 because (0.07x / 0.1x) * 100 = 70\n#### 70",
        "original_answer": 70.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the revenues in 1998.\nThe profits in 1998 were 0.1x.\nThe revenues in 1999 were 0.7x because they fell by 30 percent.\nThe profits in 1999 were 0.1 * 0.7x = 0.07x.\nThe profits in 1999 were 60 percent of the profits in 1998 because (0.07x / 0.1x) * 100 = 60\n",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The calculation (0.07x / 0.1x) * 100 was incorrectly provided as 60 instead of the correct 70 in the transformed solution. This change only impacts the final step of the calculations (step 5), which is the percentage comparison of 1999's profits to 1998's profits. All other steps remain unchanged because they are independent calculations not affected by this error.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates that the profits in 1999 were 0.07x, which is 70% of the profits in 1998 (0.1x). The explanation correctly shows the steps to arrive at the conclusion that the profits in 1999 were 60% of the profits in 1998, which is the correct percentage when comparing 0.07x to 0.1x."
