The question requires that the volume of the wall be solved by multiplying its dimensions: width, height, and length, resulting in x * 6x * 42x for the volume.

Step 5 changes from 6x * 42x * x = 16128 to 2 * (x + 6x + 42x) = 16128, and step 6 from 252x^3 = 16128 to 98x = 16128, resulting in a mistake in the value of x and a wrong transformed answer of 164.98 instead of the original 4.

        "question": "Two cubes each with side b are joined to form a cuboid. What is the surface area of this cuboid?",
        "original_solution": "The surface area of the cuboid is 2*(l*w + w*h + h*l) where l, w, and h are the dimensions of the cuboid\nThe dimensions of the cuboid formed by joining the two cubes are 2b, b, and b\nSo the surface area of the cuboid is 2*(2b*b + b*b + b*2b) = 2*(2b^2 + b^2 + 2b^2) = 2*(5b^2) = 10b^2\n#### 10b^2",
        "original_answer": "10b^2",
        "transformed_solution": "The volume of the cuboid is (l*w*h) where l, w, and h are the dimensions of the cuboid\n",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the formula for surface area and volume of a cuboid. The question asks for the surface area, requiring the use of the formula 2*(l*w + w*h + h*l), but the transformed solution incorrectly uses the volume formula (l*w*h). The language description of step 1 < The surface area of the cuboid is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. However, the calculation changes to reflect volume instead, which affects the answer in the transformed_solution. In this example, only step 1 mistakes the formula for the cuboid surface area, while the other steps, including the language used and calculations, correctly calculate volume based on the revised step 1.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "To find the surface area of the cuboid formed by joining two cubes, we first need to determine the dimensions of the cuboid. The length (l) will be twice the side of one cube (2b), the width (w) and height (h) will be the side of one cube (b). The surface area of a cuboid is given by 2lw + 2lh + 2wh.",
        "corrected_answer": "10b^2",
        "corrected_explanation": "The surface area of the cuboid is calculated by adding the surface areas of both cubes and then subtracting the areas of the two faces where the cubes are joined. Each cube has a surface area of 6b^2. When the cubes are joined, two of the faces are internal and not part of the cuboid's surface area anymore, which are 2b^2 in total. Therefore, the surface area of the cuboid is 2 * 6b^2 - 2b^2 = 10b^2."

        "question": "A cube has a volume of 64 cubic feet. If a similar cube is twice as long, twice as wide, and twice as high, then the volume, in cubic feet, of such cube is?",
        "original_solution": "Let the original side length be x.\nThe original volume of the cube is x^3=64\nSolving for x, we find x=4\nThe new side length is 2x=2*4=8\nThe new volume of the cube is (2x)^3=8^3=512\n#### 512",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the volume and surface area of a cube. The question requires that the volume of the cube to be solved be equal to the side length cubed, not 3 times the square of the side length, which is a dimensionally incorrect representation of surface area (and not even the correct formula for surface area). This error results in the original equation x^3=64 being replaced by 3*x*x=64, thus solving for x gives an incorrect value, approximately 4.62 instead of the correct 4. The subsequent steps apply the incorrect side length to determine the new cube's measurements and volume. Therefore, step 2 from  x^3=64 has been modified to 3*x*x=64 in the transformed_solution, and this single incorrect application of a formula results in a subsequently incorrect computed volume of 787.305 cubic feet instead of the correct 512 cubic feet. The language description in step 2, <The original volume of the cube is> remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. All other operations and calculations remain correct, adhering to the instruction to only modify one step.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Let the original side length of the cube be x. The original volume is x^3 = 64 cubic feet. The new cube has dimensions that are twice as long, twice as wide, and twice as high, so the new side length is 2x. The volume of the new cube is (2x)^3 = 8x^3. Since x^3 = 64, 8x^3 = 8 * 64 = 512 cubic feet.",
        "corrected_answer": "512.0",
        "corrected_explanation": "The volume of a cube is calculated by raising the length of one side to the power of three. The original cube's side length was found by cubing a value that equals 4 (since 4^3 = 64). When all dimensions are doubled, the volume increases by a factor of 2^3 because volume is directly proportional to the cube of the side length."
