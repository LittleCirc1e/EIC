        "explanation": "The example changes the multiplication (*) operator to a division (/) operator in step 3, altering b + c = 2 * 160 to b + c = 2 / 160. This change drastically decreases the value of b + c to 1.25, which then affects step 6, altering a - c = 420 - 320 to a - c = 420 - 1.25 and the final result from 100 to 418.75. It should be noted that only the operator in step 3 is incorrect, but its calculation (division) is correct, leading to a different and incorrect result than the original. This affects the subsequent step where the result of step 3 is used, but the calculations in that step are performed correctly.",

Since the average of b and c is 160, we would also have b + c = 2 * 160 = 320. To find a - c, we would subtract the equation b + c from the equation a + b, which would give us a - c = 420 - 320 = 100. However, since the solution did not provide this final step, it is assumed to be incomplete but correct up to the point shown."
