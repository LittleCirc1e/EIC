Substituting c back into the second equation, we get h + 22 = 48, so h = 26. However, this does not match our original number of heads. We made a mistake in the first equation; it should be h + c = 48, not h * c = 48. Correcting this, we solve the system of equations properly.

Step 2 changes from 144 x 33 x (5/18) = 1320 meters to 9 x 33 x (5/18) = 82.5 meters.

Since 1 kmph is equal to 5/18 m/s, the relative speed is 144 * 5/18 m/s. The faster train crosses the man in 33 seconds, so the length of the faster train can be calculated as: length = relative speed * time = (144 * 5/18) * 33.",
        "corrected_answer": "600",
        "corrected_explanation": "To find the length of the faster train, we must first calculate the relative speed by subtracting the speed of the slower train from the faster train. Then we convert the speed to meters per second by multiplying by 5/18 since 1 kmph is equal to 5/18 m/s. Finally, we multiply the relative speed in m/s by the time taken to cross the man to find the length of the train."
