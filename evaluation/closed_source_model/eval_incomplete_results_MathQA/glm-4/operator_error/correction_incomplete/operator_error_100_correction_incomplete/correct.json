This is a misguided application of the original principle that the number of monkeys and bananas doesn't change the rate of consumption per monkey.

The total distance between their homes is 36 kilometers. Therefore, the time taken to meet in the middle is 36 km / 9 km/h = 4 hours. Maxwell's distance traveled is then 3 km/h * 4 hours = 12 kilometers.",
        "corrected_answer": "12.0",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution did not correctly account for the combined speed of Maxwell and Brad as they move towards each other. The correct approach is to add their speeds together to find the combined speed and then use that to find the time taken to meet in the middle. Once the time is known, it is multiplied by Maxwell's speed to find the distance he traveled."

        "question": "In a mixed college 160 students are there in one class. Out of these 160 students, 1/2 are girls. How many boys are there?",
        "original_solution": "There are 160 x 1/2 = 80 girls in the class.\nThere are 160 - 80 = 80 boys in the class.\n#### 80",
        "original_answer": 80.0,

        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this example, the multiplication operator in step 1 has been changed to division, thus incorrectly calculating the number of girls as 160 / 1/2 = 320 instead of 160 x 1/2 = 80. This results in an impossible count of boys, calculated in step 2 as 160 - 320 = -160, which is not a feasible number of students. The original count was 80 boys, so the transformation caused by the operator error in step 1 led to a nonsensical answer. Every step's calculation is correct except for the incorrect application of the operator in step 1.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "There are 160 * 1/2 = 80 girls in the class. Therefore, there are 160 - 80 = 80 boys in the class.",
        "corrected_answer": "80",
        "corrected_explanation": "The original solution incorrectly divided the total number of students by 1/2, which would imply there are 320 students in total if all were girls. Instead, we should multiply the total number of students by 1/2 to find the number of girls, and then subtract that from the total to find the number of boys."

        "question": "A cistern can be filled by a tap in 3 hours while it can be emptied by another tap in 8 hours. If both the taps are opened simultaneously, then after how much time will the cistern get filled?",
        "original_solution": "The combined rate of both taps is 1/3 - 1/8 = 5/24 cistern/hour\nIt will take 24/5 = 4.8 hours to fill the cistern\n#### 4.8",
        "original_answer": 4.8,

        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The example changes the subtraction in step 1 to addition, converting 1/3 - 1/8 to 1/3 + 1/8 and therefore changing the result from 5/24 to 11/24. This affects step 2, where the time taken to fill the cistern changes from 24/5 = 4.8 hours to 24/11 = 2.1818 hours. The calculation in step 1 is done correctly but with the wrong operator, leading to an incorrect result, and this error carries over to step 2. However, step 2 calculations are performed correctly using the incorrect result from step 1.",

        "corrected_solution": "The filling rate of the first tap is 1/3 cistern/hour and the emptying rate of the second tap is 1/8 cistern/hour. When both taps are opened, the net rate is the difference between these two rates: 1/3 - 1/8 = 8/24 - 3/24 = 5/24 cistern/hour.",
        "corrected_answer": "4.8",
        "corrected_explanation": "To find out how long it takes to fill the cistern, we need to divide the total capacity of the cistern (which we assume to be 1) by the net rate of the taps: 1 / (5/24) = 24/5 = 4.8 hours."
