        "explanation": "Step 4 references 28 in the question as 26 wrongly, and calculates 26 + 2(d + p) instead of 28 + 2(d + p). Its subsequent related step will be affected, resulting in 2d being equal to 26 instead of 28. This leads to the incorrect calculation of d = 13 instead of d = 14 in step 6. Please note that you should only consider one error, so step 5 still references the correct relationship 4d + 2p = 28 + 2d + 2p.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The solution correctly sets up the equation representing the relationship between the number of legs and heads. It accounts for the fact that dogs have 4 legs and people have 2 legs, and that the number of legs is 28 more than twice the number of heads."

        "explanation": "Step 5 references the relationship between length and breadth (3x+x) incorrectly as 2*6x instead of 2*4x. Its subsequent related step is affected, calculating 88=2*6x instead of 88=2*4x and thus wrongfully obtaining x=7.33 instead of x=11. Length is then wrongly calculated as 3*7.33=22 instead of 3*11=33, and breadth remains as incorrectly calculated 7.33 instead of 11. Finally, the area calculation inherits these errors, yielding 22*7.33=161.26 instead of 33*11=363. All other numbers in the problem are referenced correctly.",
