The smallest integer y for which this is true is y = 8, because 3^(3*8) = 3^24 and we need y to be greater than 8 for the left side to be greater than the right side. The solution's process is correct, although it incorrectly writes 7 instead of 8 as the exponent on the right side, which is a typo but does not affect the validity of the logic."
