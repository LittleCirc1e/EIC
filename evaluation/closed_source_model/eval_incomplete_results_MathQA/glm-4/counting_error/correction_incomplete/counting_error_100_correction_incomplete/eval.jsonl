This alteration changes the total hours worked in the week from 36 to 28, leading to an incorrect calculation of the hourly wage in the later step, which changes from $396 / 36 hours = $11 per hour to $396 / 28 hours = $14.14 per hour.

{"question": "In a particular state, 60% of the counties received some rain on Monday, and 65% of the counties received some rain on Tuesday. No rain fell either day in 25% of the counties in the state. What percent of the counties received some rain on Monday and Tuesday?", "original_solution": "Let x be the percent of counties that received rain on both Monday and Tuesday\nThen, 60 + 65 - x = 100 - 25  (Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion)\n125 - x = 75 \n-x = -50 \nx = 50\n#### 50%", "original_answer": 50.0, "transformed_solution": "Let x be the percent of counties that received rain on both Monday and Tuesday\nThen, 60 + 65 - x = 100 - 20 (Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion)\n", "transformed_answer": 45.0, "wrong_step": 2, "wrong_type": "counting_error", "is_single_error": true, "explanation": "Here, step 2 mistakenly changes the percentage of counties with no rain from 25% to 20%, resulting in the inequality changing from 60 + 65 - x = 100 - 25 to 60 + 65 - x = 100 - 20. Consequently, the final answer is affected, and the correct percentage of counties that received rain on both Monday and Tuesday changes from 50% to 45%.
