Since the month starts with a Sunday, there will be 4 Sundays in the month (assuming a non-leap year February). Then we calculate the total visitors on Sundays: 150 visitors * 4 Sundays = 600 visitors. For the other days, there are 30 days in the month minus 4 Sundays, which leaves 26 days. The average number of visitors on these days is 120 visitors, so the total is 120 visitors * 26 days = 3120 visitors. The total number of visitors in the month is the sum of visitors on Sundays and other days: 600 visitors + 3120 visitors = 3720 visitors.

For the other 26 days, the average is 240 visitors per day, so the total will be 240 visitors per day * 26 days = 6240 visitors.

        "explanation": "In step 2 of the original_solution, the total days are erroneously counted as 6 instead of 7 when calculating the total rainfall for the week. This affects the following steps since the total rainfall is now incorrectly set to 18 cm instead of 21 cm. Consequently, the calculation is based on the wrong total, which also changes the final answer for Tuesday’s rainfall from 10.5 cm to 9 cm.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Let x be the amount of rain on Tuesday. The total rainfall for the week is the sum of the rainfall on the other 6 days and the rainfall on Tuesday, which is 6 times the average rainfall plus x. So, 6 * 3 + x = 18 + x. Since the average includes Tuesday's rainfall, we can set up the equation: (6 days * 3cm) + x = 7 days * 3cm, which simplifies to 18 + x = 21.",
        "corrected_answer": "3.0",
        "corrected_explanation": "To find out how much it rained on Tuesday, we need to solve the equation for x. The equation (6 days * 3cm) + x = 7 days * 3cm simplifies to 18 + x = 21. Subtracting 18 from both sides gives x = 3cm. Therefore, it rained 3cm on Tuesday."

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 mistakenly changes the percentage of counties with no rain from 25% to 20%, resulting in the inequality changing from 60 + 65 - x = 100 - 25 to 60 + 65 - x = 100 - 20. Consequently, the final answer is affected, and the correct percentage of counties that received rain on both Monday and Tuesday changes from 50% to 45%.

        "corrected_explanation": "The principle of inclusion-exclusion was correctly applied but the calculation was incorrect because it did not account for the 25% of counties that received no rain. The 25% should be subtracted from 100% to find out the remaining percentage that could have received rain on either or both days."
