        "corrected_explanation": "The solution process described is correct in setting up the problem. To solve the problem, one would typically proceed by setting up an equation to represent the revenue from small cups and large cups, where the revenue from large cups is 7/6 times the revenue from small cups. Since 4/5 of the cups sold were small, 1 - 4/5 = 1/5 of the cups sold were large. The revenue fraction from large cups would then be (7/6) * (1/5) as much as the revenue from small cups, which simplifies to 7/30. This is the correct approach, and no correction is needed in the process as it aligns with standard algebraic problem-solving methods."
