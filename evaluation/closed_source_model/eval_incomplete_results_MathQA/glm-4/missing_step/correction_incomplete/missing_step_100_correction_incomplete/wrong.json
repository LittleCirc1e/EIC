Consequently, step 2 should reference the result from the question, which is 50 doughnuts equivalent to 5 parts. The reference to each part being equivalent to 10 still holds as the calculation method is correct, but since we consider there to be 10 parts of muffins instead of 1, step 2 should be modified to reflect a 1:1 part ratio between doughnuts and muffins. Given there are 50 doughnuts, the calculation changes to 50 x 1 = 50 for the number of muffins, which should ultimately modify the formula to 50 x 1 = 50. It should be noted that the calculation in step 3 maintains the error and refers incorrectly to '10 parts of muffins', as the initial step that created the incorrect carryover effect from the deletion is step 1, thus it is marked as the wrong_step. The transformed_solution erroneously states that there are 100 muffins due to incorrectly maintaining the original step 4 calculation without adjusting for the altered quantity suggested by the deleted step 1 (10 parts was used instead of the correct 1 part, leading to multiplying by 10 instead of 1).",

After deleting this intermediate step, step 3, which originally referenced step 2, must directly reference the result from step 1 (which is the equation 3x * 4x * 7x = 18144). The subsequent steps, which refer to the result of step 4, also have to be updated. Step 5 originally referencing x^3 = 216 now directly references the product 18144, continuing with the calculation that finds x = 6 based on the cube root of 216. The last steps calculate the individual numbers based on this newly solved x, however, the calculation for 4x = 24 has been omitted. The transformed solution no longer includes the number 24, reflecting the product of 4x, hence the transformed answer is [18, 42] which is different from the original answer. The first step that references the result of the incorrect or missing step is step 3 of the transformed_solution (which was originally step 4), and therefore, wrong_step is 3.",

        "explanation": "This example removes intermediate step 4. In the original_solution, step 4 references the total number of legs and heads, and the relationship between them stated in the question, setting up the equation 4d + 2p = 28 + 2(d + p). Step 5 references the result of step 4 and simplifies the equation. Therefore, after deleting step 4, step 5 directly attempts to use the elimination method incorrectly without establishing the proper equation from the relationship of legs and heads; it incorrectly concludes that 2p can be canceled out from both sides without considering the dogs' count, leading us to a nonsensical simplification 0 = 28, which implies that the system of equations has no solution. This step also incorrectly references numbers from the question itself. Since this is nonsense and does not provide a solution, the transformed_answer is set to -1 to indicate an error in the process. It is step 3 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 4 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step removed in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 3.",

It also correctly states that the total number of legs is 4d + 2p, and the total number of heads is d + p, which is in line with the information given in the question that the number of legs is 28 more than twice the number of heads. The equation that needs to be solved is 4d + 2p = 2(d + p) + 28. However, the solution does not go on to solve the equation. Since the question does not provide enough information to solve for d without additional assumptions or information, the solution process stopped at a correct point."
