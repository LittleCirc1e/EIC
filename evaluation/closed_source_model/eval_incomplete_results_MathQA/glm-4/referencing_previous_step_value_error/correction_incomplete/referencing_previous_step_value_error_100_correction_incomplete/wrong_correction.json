After correcting the equation, we solve for x, which is the first number, and then we find the third number, which is x+4.

The correct equation should be 3x = 2(x+4) - 7, which when solved gives x=1, and the third number is x+4=1+4=5. But 5 is not even, so we must correct our mistake. The correct calculation should be: 3x = 2(x+4) + 7, which is incorrect as initially stated. The correct equation, therefore, is 3x = 2(x+4) - 7, and when solved correctly, we get x=1, and the third number is x+4=1+4=5.
