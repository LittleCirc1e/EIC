Furthermore, the transformed_answer should be different from the original_answer, which is achieved with the mistake in referencing.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Convert 65 min to hours: 65 / 60 = 1.083 hours\nCalculate the distance: 60 km/hr * 1.083 hours = 64.98 km (approximately 65 km)\nNew speed is 60 km/hr + 5 km/hr = 65 km/hr\nTime taken with new speed: Distance / New Speed = 65 km / 65 km/hr = 1 hour\n.",
        "corrected_answer": "1.0",
        "corrected_explanation": "The original solution incorrectly calculated the time taken with the new speed by using an incorrect value for the distance (70 km instead of 65 km). The distance should be calculated using the original average speed and time, and then the new time should be calculated using the new speed and the correct distance."
