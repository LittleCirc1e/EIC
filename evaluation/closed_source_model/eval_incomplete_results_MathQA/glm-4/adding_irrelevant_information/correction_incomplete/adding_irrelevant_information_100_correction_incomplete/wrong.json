        "explanation": "Step 2 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement, specifically, introducing a mistaken additional discount of 5%. This mistake changes the calculations in step 2 from a price decrease to $85 to a further reduced price of $80.75. Following this error, all subsequent calculations are based on the incorrect price of $80.75 instead of $85, resulting in the transformed solution stating the price after a 10% increase and the net change in price incorrectly.",

        "corrected_solution": "none",
        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the price after a 15% decrease. However, it does not complete the second part of the problem which is to then increase the price by 10%. To be complete, the solution should also calculate the price after the second change: $85 + (0.10 * $85) = $85 + $8.50 = $93.50. Since the question asks for the net change, the final step should subtract this new price from the original price to find the net change: $100 - $93.50 = $6.50. But since the task only requires verification up to the first step, the provided solution is correct as far as it goes."
