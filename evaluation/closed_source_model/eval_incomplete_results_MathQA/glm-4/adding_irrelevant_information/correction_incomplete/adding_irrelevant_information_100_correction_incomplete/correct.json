The distance covered by the bus is 480 km in 8 hours, so the speed of the bus is 480 km / 8 h = 60 km/h. Therefore, 12x = 60 km/h, which gives x = 5 km/h. The speed of the car is 15x = 15 * 5 = 75 km/h. There is no mention of road construction in the question, so we will not consider any reduction in the car's speed. The distance the car will cover in 6 hours is the speed of the car multiplied by the time: 75 km/h * 6 h = 450 km.",
