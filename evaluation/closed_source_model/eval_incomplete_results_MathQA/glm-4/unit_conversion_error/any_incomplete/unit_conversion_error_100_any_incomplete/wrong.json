        "original_solution": "First, convert 1 hour and 15 minutes to hours. 15 minutes is 15/60 = 0.25 hours, so the total time is 1 + 0.25 = 1.25 hours.\nNow, divide the distance by the time: 9 miles / 1.25 hours = 7.2 miles per hour.\n#### 7.2",
        "original_answer": 7.2,
        "transformed_solution": "First, convert 1 hour and 15 minutes to hours. 15 minutes is 15/50 = 0.3 hours, so the total time is 1 + 0.3 = 1.3 hours.\n",

And it affects the subsequent related step 2, which changes from 9 miles / 1.25 hours = 7.2 miles per hour to 9 miles / 1.3 hours = 6.923 miles per hour. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",
        "is_correct": "yes",

Therefore, the time taken excluding stoppages is less than the time taken including stoppages.\nDistance = speed x time\nThe speed of the bus without stoppages is 54 kmph, and with stoppages is 36 kmph, which means the bus covers 18 km less in an hour when it stops.\nTo find out for how long the bus stops, we calculate the difference in distance traveled: 54 km/h - 36 km/h = 18 km/h difference.\nThis difference of 18 km occurs because the bus is stopping for some time during the hour. To convert this lost distance back into time, we find out the fraction of the hour the bus stoppages take, which is the difference in speed (18 km/h) divided by the original speed (54 km/h).\nThis gives us 18/54 of an hour the bus is stopped. To convert this fraction to minutes, we multiply by 60 minutes/hour.\nThus, the bus stops for (18/54) * 60 minutes per hour = 20 minutes per hour.\n#### 20",
