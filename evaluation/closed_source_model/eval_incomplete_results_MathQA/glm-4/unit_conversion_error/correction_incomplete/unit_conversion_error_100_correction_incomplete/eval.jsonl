When the train is moving at 6/7 of its usual speed, the speed becomes (6/7)S mph. The distance to be covered is constant. Therefore, the usual distance D is equal to the product of the usual speed and time, D = S * T. When the train is moving at reduced speed, it takes extra time, given as 15 minutes, which is 15/60 hours = 1/4 hours. So, the time taken at reduced speed is T + 1/4. Since the distance is the same, we can equate the two distances: S * T = (6/7)S * (T + 1/4).", "corrected_answer": "2.5", "corrected_explanation": "From the equation S * T = (6/7)S * (T + 1/4), we can simplify to T = 6/7 * (T + 1/4). Solving for T gives T = 1.4286 * T + 0.8571. Rearranging gives 0.5714 * T = 0.8571, and dividing both sides by 0.5714 gives T = 1.5 hours. However, the question asks for the usual time in hours, and the extra 15 minutes late means the usual time is T - 1/4 hours = 1.5 - 0.25 = 1.25 hours. But this is a contradiction because we must have made a mistake in the calculations. Let's correct: T = 6/7 * (T + 1/4) => 7T = 6T + 6/7 * 1/4 => 7T = 6T + 6/28 => T = 6/28 => T = 3/14 hours. Since 3/14 hours is 15 minutes, the usual time must be 1 hour more, which is 1 + 3/14 = 17/14 = 1.2143 hours. However, this is still not correct as we did not convert the 15 minutes properly in the first place. The correct conversion should be 15 minutes = 15/60 hours = 1/4 hours. Now, solving the equation with the correct conversion: T = 6/7 * (T + 1/4) => 7T = 6T + 6/7 * 1/4 => 7T = 6T + 3/14 => T = 3/14 => T = 0.2143 hours. Adding the extra 15 minutes (1/4 hours), the usual time is T + 1/4 = 0.2143 + 0.25 = 0.4643 hours. Clearly, there's still an error in our calculation. Let's correct once more: The equation should be 7T = 6(T + 1/4) because the train is late by 1/4 hours when running at 6/7 the speed. Solving this equation: 7T = 6T + 6/4 => 7T = 6T + 3/2 => T = 3/2 hours = 1.5 hours. The train is 15 minutes late, so the usual time is T - 1/4 = 1.5 - 1/4 = 1.25 hours. This is the correct answer."}

After t seconds, gear p will have made (10/60)t revolutions per second and gear q will have made (40/60)t revolutions per second.
