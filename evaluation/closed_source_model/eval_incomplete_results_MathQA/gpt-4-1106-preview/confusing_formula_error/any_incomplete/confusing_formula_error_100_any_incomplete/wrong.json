        "explanation": "Here, step 8 confuses the formula for area with the formula for perimeter. The question asks for the area of the rectangle to be solved, which should be length multiplied by breadth, but it has been mistakenly changed to 2 times the sum of length and breadth, which represents the formula to calculate the perimeter. The formerly correct area formula 'Length * Breadth' in the original_solution has been incorrectly changed to '2(Length + Breadth)' in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 8 mistakenly uses the formula for rectangular perimeter instead of the area, while the other calculation processes are still correct.",

        "any_explanation": "The steps provided in the solution correctly apply the given ratio to determine the length and breadth of the park, use the speed and time to find the distance (which is the perimeter), and then solve for x to find the actual dimensions of the park. The calculations are correct as per the steps given."

The question requires that the area of the square be equal to the square of the side length, x^2, rather than the sum of all sides 4x, which is the perimeter of the square, resulting in x^2 in the original_solution becoming 4x in the transformed_solution.
