The question requires that the surface area of the cube to be solved be equal to 6 times the side length squared, rather than the side length cubed, which is equivalent to the volume of the cube, resulting in 6s^2 in the original_solution becoming s^3 in the transformed_solution.

Note that the language description of step 1 < The surface area of a cube with side length s is > in the original_solution is intentionally unchanged in the transformed_solution except for the formula changed to volume. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct.
