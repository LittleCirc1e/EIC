        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 8 confuses the formula for area with the formula for perimeter. The question asks for the area of the rectangle to be solved, which should be length multiplied by breadth, but it has been mistakenly changed to 2 times the sum of length and breadth, which represents the formula to calculate the perimeter. The formerly correct area formula 'Length * Breadth' in the original_solution has been incorrectly changed to '2(Length + Breadth)' in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 8 mistakenly uses the formula for rectangular perimeter instead of the area, while the other calculation processes are still correct.",

        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly identifies the length and breadth of the park using the given ratio and the perimeter calculated from the distance covered by the man cycling. The distance covered in one round is correctly converted from kilometers to meters and used to find the value of x, which in turn is used to find the length and breadth. The area calculation step is omitted, but since the question only asks for the verification of the solution process up to finding the length and breadth, the solution is correct."

        "explanation": "Here in step 5, the formula used for the surface area of a cube, which is 6 times the square of its side (6s^2), has been mistakenly replaced with the volume formula (s^3), resulting in the transformed_solution incorrectly relating the volume to the surface area. The correct ratio of the surface areas (x^2/y^2) should be (1/3)^2 giving (1/9), as mentioned in the original_solution. However, in the transformed_solution, the surface area was mistakenly calculated using volume values, giving (6x^3)/(6y^3) instead of (6x^2)/(6y^2), resulting in a wrong ratio of 1/27 as the transformed_answer. This introduces a single step error while keeping all other steps correctly based on their corresponding formulas.",

        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly finds the ratio of the sides of the cubes by taking the cube root of the volume ratio, which is 1/3. Since the surface area of a cube is 6 times the square of its side length, the ratio of their surface areas is the square of the ratio of their sides. Therefore, (1/3)^2 = 1/9 is the correct ratio of their surface areas."
