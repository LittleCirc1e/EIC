Its subsequent related step will be affected, calculating (160 / 220) x 100 = 72.7 instead of (150 / 210) x 100 = 71.4 in step 4. Please note that you should only consider one error, so step 4 still references the numbers from the question correctly.",

        "corrected_answer": 71.43,
        "corrected_explanation": "The total runs scored by running between the wickets should be calculated by subtracting the runs from boundaries and sixes from the total score, which is 210, not 220 as mentioned in the solution. The correct calculation is 210 - 12 - 48 = 150. Then, to find the percentage, divide the runs made by running (150) by the total runs (210) and multiply by 100."

The transformed_answer becomes 16 and 9, different from the original_answer, but the operations performed after the erroneous step are done correctly.
