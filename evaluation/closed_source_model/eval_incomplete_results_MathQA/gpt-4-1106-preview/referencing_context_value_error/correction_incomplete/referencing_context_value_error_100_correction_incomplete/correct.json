Therefore, the weight of the grape matter in 20 kgs of raisins is 0.75 * 20 kgs.\nSo, we have the equation 0.15x = 0.75 * 20.\nSolving for x, we get x = (0.75 * 20) / 0.15.\nCalculating this, x = 100 kgs.\nTherefore, 100 kgs of fresh grapes are needed to get 20 kgs of raisins.",
        "corrected_answer": 100.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly states the weight of water in fresh grapes as 0.90x instead of 0.85x. The correct process is to calculate the weight of the non-water part of the grapes, which remains constant during the drying process. Since fresh grapes are 85% water, they are 15% grape matter. Raisins are 25% water, so they are 75% grape matter. By setting the weight of grape matter equal in both fresh grapes and raisins, we can solve for the weight of fresh grapes needed to produce 20 kgs of raisins."

        "corrected_answer": 33.33,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution provided incorrectly converted the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s. The correct conversion for 54 km/hr to m/s is 54 x 1000 / 3600, which equals 15 m/s, not 13.89 m/s as stated. After correcting the speed, the total distance to be covered by the train is the sum of the train's length and the bridge's length, which is 360 m + 140 m = 500 m. The correct time is then calculated by dividing the total distance by the correct speed, resulting in 500 m / 15 m/s = 33.33 seconds."
