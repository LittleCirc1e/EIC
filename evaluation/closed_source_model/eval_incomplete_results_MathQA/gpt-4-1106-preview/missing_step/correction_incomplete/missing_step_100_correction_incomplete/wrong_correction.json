The total investment and profit calculations were then changed incorrectly throughout. As there is no base investment for b defined, the formula for b's profit adopts an arbitrary incorrect assumption that b's investment is two-thirds of c's, which is why the final answer is incorrectly calculated as Rs. 2200 instead of Rs. 1200.

By deleting the step that calculates and converts speed, the transformed_solution computes time directly using the given Distance in the question and the calculation of relative speed from the original data in the question, which avoids converting it separately to m/s.

        "question": "Sarah is driving to the airport. After driving at 50 miles per hour for one hour, she realizes that if she continues at that same average rate she will be an hour late for her flight. She then travels 100 miles per hour for the rest of the trip, and arrives 30 minutes before her flight departs. How many miles did she drive in all?",
        "original_solution": "She drove 50 miles in the first hour because 50 x 1 = 50\nShe drove 150 miles in the second part of the trip because (1 + 1/2) x 100 = 150\nShe drove 200 miles in all because 50 + 150 = 200\n#### 200",
        "original_answer": 200.0,
        "transformed_solution": "She drove 150 miles in the second part of the trip because (1 + 1/2) x 100 = 150\nShe drove 150 miles in all because 0 + 150 = 150\n",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this example, the first step which calculates how far Sarah drove in the first hour has been removed. The original step 1 resulted in 50 miles. In the transformed_solution, step 2 which originally added 50 miles from step 1 to 150 miles from what was step 2 in the original_solution must now be corrected to add 0 to 150 miles, since step 1 has been removed. This results in a total distance driven of 150 miles, as stated in the transformed_solution. The deletion of step 1 removes the reference to the number of miles driven in the first hour from the solution, which leads to an incorrect calculation of the total distance driven and a wrong transformed_answer of 150 miles, which is different from the original_answer of 200 miles. Therefore, the wrong_step is the rewritten step 2 in the transformed_solution.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Let x be the total distance of the trip. She drove for 1 hour at 50 mph, so she covered 50 miles. The remaining distance is x - 50 miles. She needs to cover this distance in (x/50 - 2) hours to be on time (1 hour late minus 1 hour driving at 50 mph). She actually covers this distance in (x/50 - 1.5) hours because she arrives 30 minutes early. At 100 mph, the time to cover the remaining distance is (x - 50)/100 hours. So, (x - 50)/100 = x/50 - 1.5. Solving for x gives x = 250 miles. Therefore, she drove 50 miles at 50 mph and 200 miles at 100 mph, for a total of 250 miles.",
        "corrected_answer": 250.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly calculates the total distance by only considering the second part of the trip. The correct process involves setting up an equation to find the total distance of the trip, taking into account the distance covered in the first hour at 50 mph and the remaining distance covered at 100 mph, while also considering the time adjustments for being late and arriving early."

Since 3 is a prime number, the only pairs of natural numbers that satisfy this condition are (1, 3) and (3, 1). The sum of the reciprocals of their squares is 1/1^2 + 1/3^2, which equals 1 + 1/9, or 10/9. The correct answer is 10/9, which is approximately 1.11 when rounded to two decimal places."
