        "corrected_solution": "In a month of 30 days starting on a Saturday, there will be 5 Saturdays and 4 Sundays.\nThe second Saturday is a holiday, so there will be 1 Saturday off.\nEvery Sunday is a holiday, so there will be 4 Sundays off.\nTotal number of holidays = 1 (second Saturday) + 4 (Sundays) = 5 holidays.\nTotal number of working days = 30 days - 5 holidays = 25 working days.",
        "corrected_answer": 25.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "Since the month starts on a Saturday and has 30 days, there will be 5 Saturdays, not 4. Only the second Saturday is a holiday, along with every Sunday. Therefore, there are 5 holidays in total, resulting in 25 working days."

        "question": "John had a stock of 1300 books in his bookshop. He sold 75 on Monday, 50 on Tuesday, 64 on Wednesday, 78 on Thursday and 135 on Friday. What percentage of the books were not sold?",
        "original_solution": "The total number of books sold is 75 + 50 + 64 + 78 + 135 = 402 books\nThe number of books not sold is 1300 - 402 = 898 books\nThe percentage of books not sold is (898 / 1300) * 100 = 69%\n#### 69",
        "original_answer": 69,

        "explanation": "In step 1 of the transformed_solution, the number of books sold on Friday is mistakenly counted as 120 instead of the original number 135. This affects the calculation of the total number of books sold, the remainder not sold, and the respective percentage. The change from 135 to 120 has modified the subsequent steps without affecting the unrelated steps, resulting in a transformed answer of approximately 70.231% compared to the original answer of 69%.",

        "corrected_solution": "The total number of books sold is 75 + 50 + 64 + 78 + 135 = 402 books.\nThe total number of books not sold is 1300 - 402 = 898 books.\nThe percentage of books not sold is (898 / 1300) * 100 = 69.08%.\n",
        "corrected_answer": 69.08,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly added the number of books sold on Friday as 120 instead of 135. The correct total number of books sold should be 402, and the correct percentage of books not sold should be calculated based on this number."
