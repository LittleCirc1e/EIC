        "original_solution": "Total books sold from Monday to Friday is 75 + 50 + 64 + 78 + 135 = 402 books\nThe remaining books after these sales is 1400 - 402 = 998 books\nThe percentage of the books not sold is (998 / 1400) * 100 = 71.2857%\nThe percentage of the books not sold is approximately 71.29%\n#### 71.29",

        "explanation": "Here, the final step inaccurately rounds the percentage from 71.2857% to 71% instead of the correct 71.29% as per the original solution. This causes the transformed answer to be different from the original answer, creating a rounding error at step 4. It's important to note that the counting in earlier steps is unchanged, with only the final rounding step being affected.",

        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the total number of books sold by adding the sales from Monday to Friday. It then correctly calculates the remaining books by subtracting the total sold from the initial stock. Finally, it correctly calculates the percentage of books not sold by dividing the remaining books by the initial stock and multiplying by 100. The final answer is rounded to two decimal places, which is a common practice for percentages."

The actual operation performed in the transformed_solution is 720 + 240 + 145 instead of the correct 720 + 240 + 160, resulting in the transformed_answer of 1105 cars instead of the original_answer of 1120 cars.

It then sums these totals to find the number of cars served over the course of a typical week. The calculations for Monday through Friday, Saturday, and Sunday are correct, and the final answer is the sum of these, which is not explicitly stated but can be inferred to be 720 + 240 + 160 = 1120 cars."

        "explanation": "Here, the wrong counting occurs at step 3 where Saturday and Sunday are mistakenly counted as a single day with 24 hours of reduced rates, instead of 2 days.

The pattern starts at 1 and increases by 4 each time (1 + 4k, where k is a non-negative integer), and the last number in the pattern that is less than 60 is 57. However, since the solution did not list 57, it seems there might be an error. But since the question specifically asks for numbers that leave a 'reminder 01' instead of 'remainder 1', and assuming 'reminder 01' was a typo, the solution provided is correct for 'remainder 1'. If 'reminder 01' is taken literally, the solution would be incorrect, but this interpretation does not make mathematical sense."
