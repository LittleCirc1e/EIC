        "explanation": "This example turns the addition in step 1 into subtraction, and by changing + to -, 0.5 - 0.5x + 0.2x = 0.4 becomes 0.5 - 0.5x - 0.2x = 0.4. This affects the subsequent related step 2. Step 2 now becomes incorrect because the term 0.2x should have been subtracted from -0.5x, but instead, it was mistakenly left as addition in the transformed solution. Therefore, the new equation after the incorrect transformation should have been 0.5 - 0.7x = 0.4, leading to -0.7x = -0.1 and x = -0.1/-0.7, which is approximately 0.14286. Hence, the explanation should reflect that an addition was incorrectly transformed into a subtraction in step 1, but the transformed solution did not correctly calculate the resultant change.",
