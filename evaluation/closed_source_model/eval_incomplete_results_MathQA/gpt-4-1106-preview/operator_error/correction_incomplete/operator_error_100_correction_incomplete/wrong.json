        "question": "The diagonals of a rhombus are 14 cm and 20 cm. Find its area?",
        "original_solution": "The area of a rhombus is given by the formula: (1/2) * d1 * d2, where d1 and d2 are the diagonals.\nPlugging in the given values: (1/2) * 14 * 20 = 140\n#### 140",

        "explanation": "The example changes the multiplication operator to division in the calculation of the area based on the original formula for the area of a rhombus, which is (1/2) * d1 * d2. It changes the operation from (1/2) * 14 * 20 to (1/2) * 14 / 20, which affects the result of the area calculation while keeping all other steps correct. As a result, the transformed answer is different from the original answer.",

        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly applies the formula for the area of a rhombus, which is (1/2) * d1 * d2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. The given diagonals are 14 cm and 20 cm, so the area is (1/2) * 14 * 20. The solution does not show the final calculation, but the formula and process are correct."

        "original_solution": "Let the three consecutive even numbers be x, x+2, and x+4\n3x = 2(x+4) + 7\n3x = 2x + 8 + 7\n3x = 2x + 15\nx = 15\nThe third number is x + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19\n#### 19",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The example changes the operator from \"+\" to \"-\" in step 1 of the original solution, turning \"3x = 2(x+4) + 7\" into \"3x = 2*(x+4) - 7\". The subsequent steps are revised based on the result of this modification: step 2 changes from \"3x = 2x + 8 + 7\" to \"3x = 2x + 8 - 7\", and step 3 changes from \"3x = 2x + 15\" to \"3x = 2x + 1\". Thus, the solution steps onward reflect the incorrect alteration in step 1 and are performed with correct calculations, leading to an incorrect transformed_answer that is different from the original_answer.",

        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The equation 3x = 2(x + 4) + 7 correctly represents the problem statement. Solving this equation yields x = 15, which makes the third number x + 4 = 19. The condition that thrice the first number exceeds double the third number by 7 is satisfied, confirming that the solution is correct."

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this example, the addition operator in the last part of step 1 is incorrectly changed to multiplication. So instead of calculating 17 + 19, I multiplied 17 * 19 to get 398. The sum of the other prime numbers is done correctly, but this change in operator leads to a different result for the step, which affects only the last part of the calculation since it is the final step. The wrong calculation is at the final addition where 17 + 19 becomes 17 * 19.",

The sum of the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19 is not explicitly shown in the solution, but if calculated, it equals 77, which is the correct sum for the first 8 prime numbers."
