        "explanation": "This case changes the multiplication operator in the original solution to addition. In step 2, instead of x(x+1)(x+2) = 210, it is changed to x(x+1)+x+2 = 210. This leads to a different equation and therefore to different solutions for x. Since the next steps depend on the value of x obtained in step 2, all of them are affected and therefore changed, yet the calculations are performed correctly based on the altered equation. The final answer for the sum of the smallest two numbers is consequently different from the original one.",

        "any_explanation": "The steps provided correctly set up the equation for three consecutive numbers whose product is 210. The equation x(x+1)(x+2) = 210 is the correct representation of the problem statement."

        "explanation": "This example turns the addition in step 1 into subtraction, and by changing + to -, 0.5 - 0.5x + 0.2x = 0.4 becomes 0.5 - 0.5x - 0.2x = 0.4. This affects the subsequent related step 2. Step 2 now becomes incorrect because the term 0.2x should have been subtracted from -0.5x, but instead, it was mistakenly left as addition in the transformed solution. Therefore, the new equation after the incorrect transformation should have been 0.5 - 0.7x = 0.4, leading to -0.7x = -0.1 and x = -0.1/-0.7, which is approximately 0.14286. Hence, the explanation should reflect that an addition was incorrectly transformed into a subtraction in step 1, but the transformed solution did not correctly calculate the resultant change.",
