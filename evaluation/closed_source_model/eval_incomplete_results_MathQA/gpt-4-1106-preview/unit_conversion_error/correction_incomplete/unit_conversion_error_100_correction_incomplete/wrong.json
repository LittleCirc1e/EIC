        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the time the train stops per hour. The train's speed without stoppages is 45 kmph, and with stoppages, it is 33 kmph. The difference in speed is due to the stoppages. By setting up the equation 45(1 - T) = 33, where T is the time in hours the train stops, and solving for T, we find that T = 4/15 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour), which gives us 4/15 * 60 = 16 minutes. Therefore, the train stops for 16 minutes per hour, which is the correct answer."

By using the average speeds and the total time, the equation is solved for x, which represents the time to go to work. The solution finds x to be 1.2 hours, which is correct. To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60, but since the question only asks for the time to drive to work, the final answer is just the value of x in hours, which is correctly found to be 1.2 hours or 72 minutes."
