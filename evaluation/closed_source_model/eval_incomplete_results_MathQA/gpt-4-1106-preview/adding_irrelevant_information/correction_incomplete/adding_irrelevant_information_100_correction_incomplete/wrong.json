        "original_solution": "First, find the amount after the first discount: 400 - (30/100 * 400) = 400 - 120 = 280\nThen, find the amount after the second discount: 280 - (20/100 * 280) = 280 - 56 = 224\n#### 224",
        "original_answer": 224.0,
        "transformed_solution": "First, find the amount after the first discount: 400 - (30/100 * 400) = 400 - 120 = 280\nThen, find the amount after the second discount: 280 - (20/100 * 280) = 280 - 56 = 224\nBecause there is an additional Rs. 20 packaging fee for the saree, the final sale price is 224 + 20 = 244\n",

        "explanation": "Step 3 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement by inserting a packaging fee of Rs. 20. The error occurs when transforming the statement 'Then, find the amount after the second discount: 280 - (20/100 * 280) = 280 - 56 = 224' from the original_solution into the transformed_solution, where it states 'Because there is an additional Rs. 20 packaging fee for the saree, the final sale price is 224 + 20 = 244'. This introduces an additional cost that changes the final answer, despite not being part of the original question. Other calculations in step 1 and 2 are unaffected and are carried out correctly.",

        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly applies two successive discounts to the original price of Rs. 400. The first discount of 30% reduces the price to Rs. 280. The second discount of 20% is then applied to the reduced price, bringing it down to Rs. 224. Finally, the solution correctly adds the Rs. 20 packaging fee to the discounted price, resulting in a final sale price of Rs. 244."

        "original_solution": "Let the numbers be x, x+2, x+4, and x+6\nThe sum is x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) = 4x + 12\n4x + 12 = 292\n4x = 280\nx = 70\nThe largest number is 70+6 = 76\n#### 76",

The error affects the computed value of x and consequently the final result for the largest number, which changes from x + 6 = 76 in the original_solution to x + 6 = 78 in the transformed_solution.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "corrected_solution": "none",
        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly identifies the four consecutive even numbers as x, x+2, x+4, and x+6. It then correctly sets up the equation for their sum as 4x + 12 and solves it to find the value of x. The largest number, which would be x+6, is correctly identified as the last of the four consecutive even numbers. Since the solution process is correct, the final answer given in the solution is also correct."
