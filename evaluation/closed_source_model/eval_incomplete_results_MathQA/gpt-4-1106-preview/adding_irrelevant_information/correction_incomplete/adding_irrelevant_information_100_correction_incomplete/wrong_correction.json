        "explanation": "Step 1 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement by supposing there is an additional red marble in the bag, which changes the total number of marbles and affects the probabilities calculated. As a result, the probability calculations in the transformed_solution incorrectly account for the total number of marbles as 9 instead of 8, and thus the answer is altered from 15/28 in the original_solution to 5/12 in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that even though this change affects multiple probabilities calculated later in the solution, it originates from a single point of error in the initial assumption.",

        "corrected_solution": "To find the probability that one white and one blue marble are left, we can use combinatorics. There are a total of 8 marbles, and we want to find the probability that after 6 marbles are drawn, we are left with 1 blue and 1 white marble.\nFirst, calculate the total number of ways to draw 6 marbles out of 8 without regard to order. This can be done using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So, C(8, 6) = 8! / (6!(8-6)!) = 28.\nNext, calculate the number of ways to draw 2 blue and 4 white marbles, which leaves us with 1 blue and 1 white marble in the bag. This is C(3, 2) * C(5, 4) = 3 * 5 = 15.\nFinally, divide the number of successful outcomes by the total number of outcomes to get the probability: P = 15 / 28.\nThe probability that one white and one blue marble are left is 15/28.",
        "corrected_answer": "0.54",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly adds an extra red marble to the bag, which is not mentioned in the question. The correct approach is to use combinatorics to calculate the probability of having one white and one blue marble left after drawing 6 marbles from the original 8 marbles (3 blue and 5 white). The corrected solution shows the proper combinatorial method to find the desired probability."
