It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct.",

        "pred_wrong_step": 3,
        "step_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 3. Step 3 adds information not included in the question statement <Because he also did a short ride of 1 mile before going to bed>, causing the result of step 3 to be overestimated by 1. Step 4, as the subsequent step of step 3, miscalculates 2+10+1=13 miles instead of 2+10=12 miles. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 3, so pred_wrong_step is 3."
