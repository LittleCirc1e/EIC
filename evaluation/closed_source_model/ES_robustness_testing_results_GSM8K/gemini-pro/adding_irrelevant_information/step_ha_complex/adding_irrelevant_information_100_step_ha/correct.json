        "step_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 3. Step 3 adds information not included in the question statement <Because he also bought 10 stamps for international envelopes>, causing the result of step 3 to be overestimated by 10. Step 4, as the subsequent step of step 3, miscalculates (40-10)/5=6 instead of (40-0)/5=8. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 3, so pred_wrong_step is 3."
