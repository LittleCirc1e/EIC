        "original_solution": "Four times Zion's age is 8 x 4 = 32.\nSo Zion's dad is 32 + 3 = 35 years old.\nIn 10 years, Zion will be 8 + 10 = 18 years old.\nIn 10 years, Zion's dad will be 35 + 10 = 45 years old.\nHence, in 10 years, Zion's dad will be 45 - 18 = 27 years older than Zion.\n#### 27",

        "transformed_solution": "Four times Zion's age is 8 x 4 = 32.\nSo Zion's dad is 32 + 3 = 35 years old.\nIn 10 years, Zion will be 5 + 10 = 15 years old.\nIn 10 years, Zion's dad will be 35 + 10 = 45 years old.\nHence, in 10 years, Zion's dad will be 45 - 15 = 30 years older than Zion.\n#### 30",

Its subsequent related step will be affected, calculating 45 - 15 = 30 instead of 45 - 18 = 27 in step 5.
