        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and area of a rectangle. The question requires that the area of the wall to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by height, rather than the sum of all four sides, which is equivalent to the perimeter, resulting in 8 ft. * 20 ft. = 160 sq. ft. in the original_solution becoming 8 ft. + 20 ft. + 8 ft. + 20 ft. = 56 sq. ft. in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent related step, where the total wall area calculation changes from 4 * 160 sq. ft. = 640 sq. ft. to 4 * 56 sq. ft. = 224 sq. ft., and the final calculation changes from 640 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 560 sq. ft. to 224 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 144 sq. ft. Note that the language description of step 1 <The solid wall is> in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 1 mistakenly uses the formula of rectangular perimeter, while the original_solution is correct in calculating the areas of the doorway, window, and closet door, and the subtraction process in the final step.",

        "question": "A school needs to paint the classroom, which is 9 meters long, 8 meters wide, and 3 meters high. The classroom has 4 windows, 2 blackboards, and 2 doors. The windows are 1m by 1.5m, the blackboards are 6m by 1m, and the doors are 2m by 1m. It is known that the paint fee is $4.80 per square meter. How much does it cost to paint a classroom?",
        "original_solution": "Because the floor does not require painting, the total surface area of the classroom excluding the floor, is 9 * 8+8 * 3 * 2+9 * 3 * 2=174 square meters.\nOne window has an area of 1 * 1.5=1.5 square meters.\nFour windows have an area of 4 * 1.5=6 square meters.\nOne blackboard has an area of 6 * 1=6 square meters.\nTwo blackboards have an area of 2 * 6=12 square meters.\nOne door has an area of 2 * 1=2 square meters.\nTwo doors have an area of 2 * 2=4 square meters.\nAnd the area that needs to be painted is 174-6-12-4=152 square meters.\nBecause the paint fee of $4.80 is required per square meter, painting a classroom costs 152 * 4.8=$729.6.\n#### 729.6",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the total surface area of the walls with incorrectly summing the lengths of the classroom, which is equivalent to calculating the perimeter of the floor. The correct calculation for the total surface area of the walls is based on the formula 2*(length*height + width*height), resulting in 9 * 8 + 8 * 3 * 2 + 9 * 3 * 2 = 174 square meters in the original_solution becoming 9 + 8 + 8 + 3 + 3 + 9 + 3 = 43 square meters in the transformed_solution.
