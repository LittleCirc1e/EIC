The question requires that the volume of the cuboid to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width multiplied by height, rather than 2*(width+height+width+height)+2*(length*width), which is equivalent to the surface area of a cuboid, resulting in 4*3*2=24 in the original_solution becoming 2*(3+4+3+4)+2*(3*4)=40 in the transformed_solution.

        "explanation": "Here, in step 1, the calculation of the total surface area has been incorrectly changed to calculate total length around the classroom like a perimeter, which is not the correct approach as it neglects the height and considers only length and width. The appropriate method is to consider length, width, and height to calculate the surface area of the walls. This incorrect transformation results in a different value for the total surface area and consequently the cost of painting the classroom.",

        "step_explanation": "The step 5 is the first step to make a mistake. The correct formula to calculate the length that needs to be painted is 2 * (9 + 8) + 3 * 2 * 2 = 42 meters, instead of 34 meters."

        "question": "John decided to start rowing around a square lake.  Each side of the lake is 15 miles.  Jake can row at twice the speed he can swim.  It takes him 20 minutes to swim 1 mile.  How long, in hours, does it take to row the lake?",
        "original_solution": "The perimeter of the lake is 4*15=60 miles\nHe swims at a speed of 60/20=3 mph\nSo he rows at a speed of 3*2=6 mph\nThat means it takes him 60/6=10 hours to row around the lake\n#### 10",
        "original_answer": 10.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The area of the lake is 15*15=225 miles\nHe swims at a speed of 60/20=3 mph\nSo he rows at a speed of 3*2=6 mph\nThat means it takes him 225/6=37.5 hours to row around the lake\n#### 37.5",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and area of the square. The question requires that the perimeter of the square to be solved be equal to the side length multiplied by 4, rather than the side length multiplied by itself, which is equivalent to the area of the square, resulting in 4*15=60 in the original_solution becoming 15*15=225 in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 4, changing from 60/6=10 hours to 225/6=37.5 hours to row around the lake. Note that the language description of step 1 < The perimeter of the lake is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that only step 1 mistakenly uses the formula for square area, while the other calculation processes related to the speed and time are still correct in the transformed_solution.",

        "step_explanation": "The speed of swimming is calculated by dividing the distance by the time, so the speed of swimming is 1/20 miles per minute, not 60/20 miles per hour."

        "question": "Bill gets a flat-screen TV that measures 48 inches by 100 inches. His brother Bob gets a TV that measures 70 inches by 60 inches. If the TVs weigh 4 oz per square inch of screen space, how much more does the heavier TV weigh in pounds? (There are 16 ounces per pound).",
        "original_solution": "First find the screen area of Bill's TV: 48 inches * 100 inches = 4800 square inches\nThen find the screen area of Bob's TV: 70 inches * 60 inches = 4200 square inches\nThen subtract the size of the smaller TV from the size of the bigger TV to find the size difference: 4800 square inches - 4200 square inches = 600 square inches\nThen multiply the size difference by the weight per square inch to find the weight difference: 600 square inches * 4 oz/square inch = 2400 oz\nThen divide the weight difference in ounces by the number of ounces per pound to find the weight difference in pounds: 2400 oz / 16 oz/pound = 150 pounds\n#### 150",

        "transformed_solution": "First find the perimeter of Bill's TV: 48 inches + 48 inches + 100 inches + 100 inches = 296 inches\nThen find the screen area of Bob's TV: 70 inches * 60 inches = 4200 square inches\nThen subtract the size of the smaller TV from the size of the bigger TV to find the size difference: 296 inches - 4200 square inches = -3904 square inches\nThen multiply the size difference by the weight per square inch to find the weight difference: -3904 square inches * 4 oz/square inch = -15616 oz\nThen divide the weight difference in ounces by the number of ounces per pound to find the weight difference in pounds: -15616 oz / 16 oz/pound = -976 pounds\n#### -976",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 mistakenly uses the perimeter formula instead of the area formula for Bill’s TV. The question requires finding the area (length multiplied by width), but the step has been modified to calculate the perimeter (sum of all sides), leading to 48 inches * 100 inches = 4800 square inches in the original_solution becoming 48 inches + 48 inches + 100 inches + 100 inches = 296 inches in the transformed_solution. This error changes the values in the subsequent calculation steps, as the subtraction is now incorrect and thus affects the calculation of the weight difference in both ounces and pounds. All other calculation processes are correct, with only step 1 containing the error. The wording of the step remains as <First find the screen area of Bill's TV:>, but the calculation thereafter is altered to fit the error introduced.",
