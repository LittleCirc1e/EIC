        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and volume calculations. The original_solution properly calculates the volume of the rectangular prism by multiplying the side of the square base with itself and then by the height (2*2*8), but the transformed_solution incorrectly treats the calculation as if finding the perimeter of the base (2+2+2+2). By changing the formula from volume to perimeter, the result is an incorrect volume calculation, influencing the subsequent weight calculation in step 2. As a result, the original_solution's correct volume of 32 cubic meters used to find the weight (2700*32) is erroneously transformed to an incorrect volume of 8 cubic meters (2+2+2+2) and the subsequent incorrect weight (2700*8). It's important to note that only step 1 has been modified to introduce the confusing formula error, affecting the related step 2, while no language description has been changed.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_step": 1,
        "step_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 1. Step 1 confuses the perimeter and area formulas of square and it should calculate the area of the square which is equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the length plus length plus length plus length, equivalent to the perimeter of the square. That means, it should calculate 2 m * 2 m = 4 square meters instead of 2 m + 2 m + 2 m + 2 m = 8 cubic meters. Step 2, as the subsequent step of step 1, references the wrong result of step 1, resulting in the incorrect final answer. Step 2 miscalculates 2700 * 8 = 21,600 kg instead of 2700 * 4 = 10,800 kg. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 1, so pred_wrong_step is 1."
