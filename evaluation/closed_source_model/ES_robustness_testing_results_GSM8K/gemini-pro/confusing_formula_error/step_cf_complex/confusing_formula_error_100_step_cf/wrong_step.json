Therefore, the calculation 2*2*8=32 cubic meters in the original_solution is mistakenly replaced with 2+2+2+2=8 cubic meters in the transformed_solution, which affects step 2, changing the weight calculation from 2700*32=86,400 kg to 2700*8=21,600 kg.

Instead, the transformed solution incorrectly calculates the perimeter by adding all sides, resulting in 2 feet * 4 feet = 8 square feet in the original_solution changing to 2 feet + 4 feet + 2 feet + 4 feet = 12 square feet in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 3, changing the calculation of the percentage of the wall covered from 8 square feet / 50 square feet * 100% = 16% to 12 square feet / 50 square feet * 100% = 24%. Note that the language description of step 1 < First find the area of the painting: > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that only one step of confusing formula error is considered, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 1 mistakenly uses the formula for rectangular area, while the other steps correctly calculate the area of the wall and the percentage.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_step": 2,
        "step_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 confuses the perimeter and area formulas of rectangle and it should calculate the area of the rectangle which is equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the length plus length plus width plus width, equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle. That means, it should calculate 2 ft. * 4 ft. = 8 sq. ft. instead of 2 feet + 4 feet + 2 feet + 4 feet = 12 square feet. Step 3 and 4, as the subsequent steps of step 2, reference the wrong result of step 2, resulting in the incorrect final answer. Step 3 miscalculates 12 square feet / 50 square feet = 0.24 instead of 8 square feet / 50 square feet = 0.16. And step 4 miscalculates 0.24 * 100% = 24% instead of 0.16 * 100% = 16%. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 2, so pred_wrong_step is 2."
