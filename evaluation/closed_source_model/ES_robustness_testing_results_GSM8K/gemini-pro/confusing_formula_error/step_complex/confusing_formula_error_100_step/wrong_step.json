        "original_solution": "A triangle with a height of 2 inches and width of 2 inches has an area of 2 square inches because (1/2) x 2 x 2 = 2\nThe square has an area of 4 square inches because 2 x 2 = 4\n2 triangles would fit because 4 / 2 = 2\n#### 2",
        "original_answer": 2.0,
        "transformed_solution": "A triangle with a height of 2 inches and width of 2 inches has an area of 2 square inches because (1/2) x 2 + 2 = 3\nThe square has an area of 4 square inches because 2 x 2 = 4\n2 triangles would fit because 4 / 3 = 1.3333\n#### 1.3333",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 incorrectly calculates the area of a triangle by adding rather than multiplying the base and height and then dividing by 2. The correct formula for the area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height, which would result in (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2 square inches. However, the transformed_solution changes this to (1/2) * 2 + 2 = 3, which is a misunderstanding of the formula for the area of a triangle, resulting in an incorrect area calculation. This incorrect area affects the subsequent step, changing the calculation of how many triangles would fit from 4 / 2 = 2 to 4 / 3 ≈ 1.3333. It is important to note that the transformed_solution only alters the formula application in step 1, while the other steps remain correct in their calculations, although they use the incorrect value from the first step to carry out the division.",

The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 3, so pred_wrong_step is 3."

The question requires that the area of the triangular sail to be solved be equal to the half of the area of a square with the same height and length. Instead, the perimeter of the square with the same height and length was mistakenly calculated, resulting in 3 inches * 4 inches = 12 square inches in the original_solution being changed to 3 inches + 4 inches + 3 inches + 4 inches = 14 square inches in the transformed_solution. This incorrect calculation affects the subsequent step 3, which divides the incorrect perimeter in half instead of dividing the correct area in half. The division calculation remains correct, but the input value is wrong due to the previous mistake. All other steps should continue to use correct formulas, ensuring that only one error is introduced in the transformation process. In this example, only step 2 mistakenly confuses the concepts of perimeter and area, while for step 3, division is still correct in form, but it is misapplied based on the incorrect previous step, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",
