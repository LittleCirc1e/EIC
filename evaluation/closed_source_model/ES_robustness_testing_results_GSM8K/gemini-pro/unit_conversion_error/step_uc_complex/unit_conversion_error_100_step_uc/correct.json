This affects steps 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Step 2 erroneously calculates 100 minutes + 10 minutes = 110 minutes instead of 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 130 minutes. Step 3 erroneously substitutes 8s into s + 8s + 13 = 110 instead of s + 8s + 13 = 130. Step 4 erroneously combines like terms to get 9s + 13 = 110 instead of 9s + 13 = 130. Step 5 erroneously subtracts 13 from both sides to get 9s = 97 instead of 9s = 117. Step 6 erroneously divides both sides by 9 to get s ≈ 10.78 instead of s ≈ 13. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 1, so pred_wrong_step is 1."
