This implies that Jack received the entire $100 from Sophia instead of 1/5 of it. The step that adds $100 directly to Jack's original amount uses the number from the question and should only have used the result of the missing calculation of 1/5 of Sophia's $100. The wrong_step is step 1 in the transformed_solution, corresponding to the calculation of Jack's new total without considering Sophia's contribution as 1/5 of her money. This results in an incorrect transformed_answer of $200, different from the original_answer of $120.",

This also affects the subsequent step 2, where an incorrect calculation of 200 instead of 120 results in the final erroneous result.

It makes an error by incorrectly calculating the garden's fence length as 2 * (27) = 54 yards. Subsequently, the calculation for the combined length becomes 108 + 54 = 162 yards.
