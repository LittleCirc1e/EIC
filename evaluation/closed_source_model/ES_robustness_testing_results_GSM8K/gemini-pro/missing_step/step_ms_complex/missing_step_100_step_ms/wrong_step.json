        "explanation": "In this example, step 1 has been removed. The original_solution's first step calculates the number of pies Eddie bakes in 7 days, and the subsequent steps calculate the sister's and mother's output, before summing them all in the final step. After deleting step 1, the final step needs to change to directly reference the number of pies Eddie can bake without calculating it separately. Originally Eddie's contribution is 3 * 7 = 21, but since we're no longer calculating this, we directly use 3*7 in the sum, hence the new formula becomes 3*7 + 42 + 56 = 119. However, an error was introduced in the transformed solution: instead of summing up the correct numbers to maintain the original answer, the total was incorrectly added as 3*7 + 42 + 56 = 133. Due to this error, the transformed answer differs from the original. The wrong_step is 3 which is the first step that has the incorrect reference in the transformed_solution. The step directly introduces Eddie's contribution without calculating it as a separate step.",

There is a necessary step missing here to calculate the total number of pies baked by Eddie in 7 days, which is 3 * 7 = 21. Step 4 should calculate 21 + 42 + 56 = 119 instead of 3 + 42 + 56 = 119. This also affects the subsequent step 5, where an incorrect calculation of 119 + 14 = 133 instead of 119 + 14 = 133, resulting in the final erroneous result. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 4, so pred_wrong_step is 4."

        "question": "Marcus has received a commission for as many paintings as possible.

Since the first step is missing, we need to adjust the final summation step (original Step 5) to compensate for this removal. The original solution went through 5 steps to show the progression of paintings from Day 1 to Day 5. By removing the first day's 2 paintings and not adjusting the final sum to account for this absence, it results in an error in calculation. Specifically, the final sum should still be 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 as in the original solution. However, in the transformed step, the summation incorrectly doubles the calculated total to 124, which becomes the transformed_answer. Therefore, the wrong_step is the last remaining one (number 5 in the sequence of steps that have not been deleted), as it improperly adjusts for the missing step and incorrectly doubles the total count, showing a calculation error.",

This also affects the final result, where an incorrect calculation of 62+32=124 instead of 30+32=62, resulting in the final erroneous result.

However, instead of using the correct multiplication and addition, there was a mistake in combining the operations, leading to an incorrect new step of 'Walt's Monday and Tuesday walk were 4+4*6 = 52 miles combined.' This is mathematically incorrect because it does not respect the order of operations (multiplication should be done before addition). This incorrect step results in the subsequent step calculating Walt's Wednesday walk by subtracting 52 from 41, yielding an incorrect negative distance. It is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 2 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing incorrect number in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 1.",

This causes a change in subsequent calculations, where now the total number of pebbles is divided by 4 groups instead of 3, which is a mistake because the question specifies the remaining pebbles are divided into 3 groups, not 4. This incorrect modification affects the calculation of yellow pebbles resulting in a different answer, as the division would then include the blue pebbles in the count.
