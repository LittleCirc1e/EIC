        "question": "Berry is curious about what his average temperature is during the week. On Sunday his temperature is 99.1. On Monday his temperature is 98.2. On Tuesday his temperature is 98.7. On Wednesday his temperature is 99.3. On Thursday his temperature is 99.8. On Friday his temperature is 99. On Saturday his temperature is 98.9. What is his average temperature that week?",
        "original_solution": "The total temperature for the week is 693 because 99.1 plus 98.2 plus 98.7 plus 99.3 plus 99.8 plus 99 plus 98.9 equals 693.\nHis average temperature is 99 degrees because 693 divided by 7 equals 99.\n#### 99",
        "original_answer": 99.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total temperature for the week is 693 because 99.1 plus 98.2 plus 98.7 plus 99.3 plus 99.8 plus 99 plus 98.9 equals 693.\nHis average temperature is 99 degrees because 693 divided by 6 equals 115.5.\n#### 115.5",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 mistakenly counts Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday as 6 days instead of 7 days, resulting in <His average temperature is 99 degrees because 693 divided by 7 equals 99.> in the original_solution being changed to <His average temperature is 115.5 degrees because 693 divided by 6 equals 115.5.> in the transformed_solution. Only one counting error is present, which is changing the divisor from 7 to 6, while the division calculation process itself remains correct.",

        "step_explanation": "Step 2 first erroneously counts Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday as 6 days instead of 7 days, resulting in an error in the divisor in the formula. And step 2 calculates 693/6=115.5 instead of 693/7=99, resulting in the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the miss, is step 2, so pred_wrong_step is 2"
