On Monday, she made 10 bonnets, on Tuesday and Wednesday combined she made twice more than on Monday, while on Thursday she made 5 more than on Monday, and on Friday she made 5 less than on Thursday. Then, she divided up the bonnets evenly and sent them to 5 orphanages. How many bonnets did Mrs. Young send to each orphanage?",
        "original_solution": "She made 10 x 2 = 20 bonnets on Tuesday and Wednesday.\nWhile on Thursday she made 10 + 5 = 15 bonnets.\nOn Friday she made 15 - 5 = 10 bonnets.\nMrs. Young made a total of 10 + 20 + 15 + 10 = 55 bonnets for the orphanage.\nTherefore, Mrs. Young sends 55 / 5 = 11 bonnets to each orphanage.\n#### 11",

        "explanation": "Here, in step 5, the original_solution's division process mistakenly divides the total number of bonnets by 4 orphanages instead of the correct 5 orphanages, resulting in an incorrect number of bonnets per orphanage. This directly affects the final answer. The rest of the arithmetic operations are unchanged, but this division error results in a different answer from the original_solution.",

        "question": "It’s exam season and Tristan has several exams to prepare for. On Monday, he studies for 4 hours then studies for twice this long on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday he studies for 3 hours each day. He wants to study for a total of 25 hours over the week and divides the remaining amount of study time evenly between Saturday and Sunday. How many hours does Tristan spend studying on Saturday?",
        "original_solution": "On Tuesday, Tristan studies twice as long as he did on Monday and this amounts to 4 hours * 2 = 8 hours.\nSo in the first 5 days of the week, he studies for a total of 4 hours Monday + 8 hours Tuesday + 3 hours Wednesday + 3 hours Thursday + 3 hours Friday = 21 hours.\nHe therefore has 25 planned hours – 21 used hours = 4 hours left to study.\nAs he splits his time evenly over 2 days, he spends 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours studying on Saturday.\n#### 2",

        "explanation": "Here, step 4 of the transformed_solution incorrectly assumes that the weekend is 1 day instead of 2, therefore changing 4 hours / 2 to 4 hours / 1. The mistake results in Tristan spending all 4 remaining hours on Saturday as opposed to dividing them evenly between Saturday and Sunday. This counting error affects only the final step related to the allocation of study hours over the weekend and the subsequent calculation of hours studied on Saturday, without affecting previous or unrelated steps.",

The subsequent step 8 references the result of step 7, calculating 4 hours studying on Saturday instead of 2 hours studying on Saturday, resulting in the final incorrect answer.
