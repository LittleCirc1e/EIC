He wants to study for a total of 25 hours over the week and divides the remaining amount of study time evenly between Saturday and Sunday. How many hours does Tristan spend studying on Saturday?",
        "original_solution": "On Tuesday, Tristan studies twice as long as he did on Monday and this amounts to 4 hours * 2 = 8 hours.\nSo in the first 5 days of the week, he studies for a total of 4 hours Monday + 8 hours Tuesday + 3 hours Wednesday + 3 hours Thursday + 3 hours Friday = 21 hours.\nHe therefore has 25 planned hours – 21 used hours = 4 hours left to study.\nAs he splits his time evenly over 2 days, he spends 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours studying on Saturday.\n#### 2",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 mistakenly counts the number of days Zainab passes out flyers as 2 days instead of 3 days per week, resulting in the original calculation of $8/day * 3 days = $24 being changed to $8/day * 2 days = $16 in the transformed_solution. Subsequently, the error affects step 3, changing the final calculation from $24 * 4 = $96 to $16 * 4 = $64. The initial earning calculation for a single day remains unaffected by the counting error, and only the subsequent steps that rely on the number of days are impacted.",
