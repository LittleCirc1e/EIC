However, today she is using a new varnish and it takes 12 minutes for the coat to dry. How much longer will it take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish?",
        "original_solution": "Usually, the varnish on all 6 paintings would be dry in 7*6=42 minutes\nWith the new varnish, all 6 paintings would be dry in 12*6=72 minutes\nWith the new varnish, it will take 72-42=30 more minutes\n#### 30",
