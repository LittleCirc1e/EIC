        "explanation": "Step 6 mistakenly references 140 as 150 from step 5 and changes 7*x=140 to 7*x=150. It should be noted that step 5 in the transformed_solution <7*x+2=142> should be the same as the step 5 in the original_solution <7*x+2=142> and calculates its result 140 correctly. The subsequent step, step 7, is affected by the incorrect result of step 6 but still computes the result correctly using the erroneous value from step 6, changing x=20 to x=21.429. There is no need to modify the previous steps as you only need to consider one error of referencing, and the calculation of all steps should still be correct.",

        "step_explanation": "Step 5 first erroneously references the result 150 instead of 140 from step 4, resulting in the calculation of 150 / 7 = 21.429 instead of 140 / 7 = 20. And this causes an error in the final result. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 5, so pred_wrong_step is 5."
