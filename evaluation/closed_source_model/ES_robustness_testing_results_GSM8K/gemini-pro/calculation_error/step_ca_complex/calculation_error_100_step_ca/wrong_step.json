        "original_solution": "Of her 42 lollipops, half were cherry, so 42 lollipops / 2 = 21 were not cherry.\nOf the 21 that were not cherry, 1/3 of them were grape, so 21 lollipops / 3 = 7 grape lollipops.\n#### 7",

        "explanation": "In this example, the 42 lollipops / 2 calculation in step 1 is mistakenly given as 22 instead of 21. This error affects the second step since it relies on the outcome of the first step. Therefore, the second step takes the incorrect value of 22 and proceeds with the division by 3 to find the number of grape lollipops. However, the division is still correctly calculated using the erroneous value. No other parts of the original solution, including operators or operands, are changed.",

The subsequent step 4 references the result of step 3, resulting in the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 3, so pred_wrong_step is 3."

Step 3 accordingly changes from 40/4=10 to 35/4=8.75 to take into account the erroneous total given away. All changes only affect the steps after the error, while the step before the error, which is step 1 in this case, remains unaffected. The wrong calculation result in step 2 is carried through to the subsequent step, modifying both the operands used in the calculation and the explanatory text, but the calculation process within each step is performed correctly.",
