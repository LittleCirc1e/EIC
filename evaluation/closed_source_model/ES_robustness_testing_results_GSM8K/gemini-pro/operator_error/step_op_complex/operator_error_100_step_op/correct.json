        "explanation": "The example changes the addition operation in step 3 to division. By changing + to /, the original calculation of 1200 + 600 = 1800 visitors becomes 1200 / 600 = 2 visitors. This affects the final step 4, as it now incorrectly calculates the earnings with the wrong number of visitors. It should be noted that only the operator change at step 3 is incorrect, but the calculation for that step is performed correctly given the erroneous operator, leading to an incorrect result for that step. This single error affects the final step, but the calculation of the final step itself is accurate based on the incorrect input provided.",
