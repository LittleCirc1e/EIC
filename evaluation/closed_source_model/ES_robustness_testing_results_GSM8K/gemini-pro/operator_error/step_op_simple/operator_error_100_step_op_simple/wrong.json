        "question": "Valerie needs to put stamps on the envelopes she is about to mail. She has thank you cards for each of her grandmother, uncle and aunt for the birthday presents they sent. She also has to pay the water bill and the electric bill separately. She wants to send three more mail-in rebates than she does bills and she has twice as many job applications as rebates to mail. How many stamps does she need if everything needs 1 stamp except the electric bill, which needs 2?",
        "original_solution": "Valerie has to send a thank you card to each of 3 people, so she has 3 * 1 = 3 thank you cards to mail.\nShe has 2 bills to mail.\nShe has 3 more rebates than bills, so 3 + 2 = 5 mail-in rebates to mail.\nShe has twice as many job applications as rebates, so she has 2 * 5 = 10 applications to mail.\nShe has 3 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 20 pieces of mail to send.\nThe electric bill needs an extra stamp, so she needs 20 + 1 = 21 stamps.\n#### 21",

        "explanation": "The example modifies the addition in step 3 to subtraction, changing the formula \"3 + 2 = 5\" to \"3 - 2 = 1\". The single step that has been modified is only the operator in step 3, but it is calculated correctly, which leads to a different result from the original answer, affecting subsequent related steps. The number of rebates affects the job applications as well (step 4 changes from \"2 * 5 = 10\" to \"2 * 1 = 2\"), and subsequently also changes the total number of mail pieces to send (step 5 changes from \"3 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 20\" to \"3 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 8\"). The last step (step 6) adds an extra stamp for the electric bill, changing from \"20 + 1 = 21\" to \"8 + 1 = 9\" stamps needed. The explanation makes clear that only the operator in step 3 is incorrect, leading to its incorrect result and affecting subsequent calculations, which are however correctly performed with the modified values.",

        "explanation": "The operator error occurs in step 1 of the original solution, where division (/) is converted to multiplication (*). The statement \"Kris has 12/4 = 3 turtles\" is modified to \"Kris has 12*4 = 48 turtles\". This incorrect change of operator leads to a wrong calculation and erroneously increases the number of turtles that Kris is said to have. Consequently, the calculation in step 2 using Kris's incorrect turtle count, \"Trey has 48*7 = 336 turtles\", is correct given the modified step 1 but results in an incorrect number of turtles for Trey. Likewise, step 3 now uses the inflated turtle count for Trey, resulting in \"Trey has 336-12 = 324 more turtles than Kristen\". Each step after the initial operator error is calculated correctly based on the altered values from the previous step. Therefore, the resulting transformed answer, which is the difference in turtle count between Trey and Kristen, becomes 324 instead of the correct answer 9.",
