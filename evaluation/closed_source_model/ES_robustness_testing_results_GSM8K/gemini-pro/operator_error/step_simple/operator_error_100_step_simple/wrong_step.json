Step 3 changes from 50-40=$10 to 50-62.50=$-12.50, creating an erroneous negative value for the selling price. Consequently, step 4 changes from 1800*10=$18,000 to 1800*-12.50=$-22,500, resulting in a negative sales total. This negative revenue leads to step 5 wherein the store's leftover money turns from a positive value (18,000-15,000=$3,000) to a negative value (-22,500-15,000=$-37,500), suggesting the store is in debt after the sale.
