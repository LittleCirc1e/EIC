        "original_solution": "Since a year has 365 days, the total television production in the first year is 10*365 = 3650\nIn the second year, they reduced the total television production by 10/100*3650 = 365\nThe total television production in the second year was 3650-365 = 3285.\n#### 3285",

        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this example, the division in step 2 is changed to multiplication, turning 10/100*3650=365 into 10*100*3650=3650000 by changing / to *. The consequent step 3 that utilizes this result is affected, changing 3650-365=3285 into 3650-3650000=-3646350. It should be noted that the change takes place only in the operator of step 2, but the calculation thereafter is correct, leading to a different result that impacts the related subsequent steps, all of which, however, are correctly computed based on the altered result of the erroneous step 2.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_step": 3,
        "step_explanation": "Step 3 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 10*100*3650 = 3650000 instead of 10*10*3650 = 365000. The subsequent step 4 references the result of step 3, calculating 3650-3650000 = -3646350 instead of 3650-365000 = 3285. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 3, so pred_wrong_step is 3."
