The mistake in the first step carries over to the second step '8722 + 188 = 8910' to maintain the inherited error. The subsequent step is affected by using the erroneous result of 188; however, this step is still calculated correctly based on the new wrong input. The original step is '8722 + 178 = 8900', and the transformed solution alters the outcome to '8722 + 188 = 8910'. The transformed answer is therefore 8910, which is different from the original answer of 8900. This simulates a single miscalculation without changing any operands or operators in the formula.",

The result of this miscalculation is that each person is incorrectly calculated to get \"20/2 = 10 birthday candles\" instead of the correct answer of \"14 birthday candles\".
