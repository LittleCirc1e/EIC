        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references the added time of 20 seconds as 25 from step 3. Despite this inconsistency, step 3 in the transformed_solution <At the end of his third week of practice, Brian adds another 50% of 40 seconds to his time so 40*.5= 20 seconds added> remains exactly the same as step 3 in the original_solution, which correctly calculates the result as 20 seconds. The incorrect reference changes the calculation in step 4 from 40+20= 60 seconds to 40+25= 65 seconds. We only consider this single error, and all calculations are properly carried out based on the error made in that particular step.",
