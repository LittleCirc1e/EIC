        "explanation": "Here, step 3 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means there are wrongly 50 minutes in an hour instead of 60 minutes, resulting in 480/60 = 8 hours in the original_solution becoming 480/50 = 9.6 hours in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 4, which changes from the latest she can start being 10:00 am (18:00 - 8 hours) to the latest she can start is 8:24 am (18:00 - 9.6 hours, where 0.6 hours equals 36 minutes). It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, so the unit conversion of the previous steps and other calculation processes are still correct.",

        "step_explanation": "Step 3 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 480/50=9.6 instead of 480/60=8.
