        "question": "Mrs. Young makes bonnets for kids in the orphanage. On Monday, she made 10 bonnets, on Tuesday and Wednesday combined she made twice more than on Monday, while on Thursday she made 5 more than on Monday, and on Friday she made 5 less than on Thursday. Then, she divided up the bonnets evenly and sent them to 5 orphanages. How many bonnets did Mrs. Young send to each orphanage?",
        "original_solution": "She made 10 x 2 = 20 bonnets on Tuesday and Wednesday.\nWhile on Thursday she made 10 + 5 = 15 bonnets.\nOn Friday she made 15 - 5 = 10 bonnets.\nMrs. Young made a total of 10 + 20 + 15 + 10 = 55 bonnets for the orphanage.\nTherefore, Mrs. Young sends 55 / 5 = 11 bonnets to each orphanage.\n#### 11",

        "explanation": "Here, in step 5, the original_solution's division process mistakenly divides the total number of bonnets by 4 orphanages instead of the correct 5 orphanages, resulting in an incorrect number of bonnets per orphanage. This directly affects the final answer. The rest of the arithmetic operations are unchanged, but this division error results in a different answer from the original_solution.",

        "step_explanation": "Step 5 first erroneously divides the total number of bonnets by 4 instead of 5, resulting in an error in the divisor in the formula. And step 5 calculates 55/4=13.75 instead of 55/5=11, resulting in the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the miss, is step 5, so pred_wrong_step is 5"
