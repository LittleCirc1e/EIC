It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_step": 3,
        "step_explanation": "Step 3 first makes a mistake in adding 9 toys to 30 toys, calculating 9 toys + 30 toys = 39 toys instead of 60 toys + 30 toys = 90 toys. The subsequent step 4 references the result of step 3, calculating 60 toys + 39 toys = 104 toys instead of 60 toys + 30 toys = 90 toys, resulting in the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 3, so pred_wrong_step is 3."
