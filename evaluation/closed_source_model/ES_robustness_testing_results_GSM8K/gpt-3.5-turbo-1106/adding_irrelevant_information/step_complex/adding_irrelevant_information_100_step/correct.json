If it weighs less than that, it will only need 2 stamps. If he bought 52 stamps with 6 envelopes that weigh less than 5 pounds, how many envelopes in total did Micah need to buy?",
        "original_solution": "Micah had to buy 6*2=12 stamps for 6 envelopes less than 5 pounds.\nHe has 52-12=40 more stamps to buy.\nThere are 40/5=8 envelopes that weigh more than 5 pounds.\nMicah needed to buy 8+6=14 envelopes.\n#### 14",

Consequently, the final result changes from Micah needing to buy 8+6=14 envelopes to 6+6=12 envelopes.
