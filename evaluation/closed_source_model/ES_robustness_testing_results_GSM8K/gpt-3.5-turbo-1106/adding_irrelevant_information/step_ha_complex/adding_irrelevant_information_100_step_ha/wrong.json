        "transformed_solution": "Emma had $230 - $60 = $170 left in her bank account after she withdrew $60.\nThe next week, she deposited $60 x 2 = $120. Because she was charged a bank fee of $15 for her account maintenance, she now has a total of $170 + $120 - $15 = $275 in her bank account.\n#### 275",

She does her shopping only at a specific store where she is allowed a credit of $100, which must be paid in full before her next shopping trip. That week she spent the full credit limit and paid $15 of it on Tuesday and $23 of it on Thursday. How much credit will Mary need to pay before her next shopping trip?",
