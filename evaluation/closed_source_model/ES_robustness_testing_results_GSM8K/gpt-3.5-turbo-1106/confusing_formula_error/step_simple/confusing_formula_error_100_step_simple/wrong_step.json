The question requires that the volume of the rectangular prism to be solved be equal to the base area multiplied by the height, rather than the base perimeter plus four times the height, which is incorrect. In reality, calculating the base perimeter does not contribute to volume calculation. Therefore, the calculation 2*2*8=32 cubic meters in the original_solution is mistakenly replaced with 2+2+2+2=8 cubic meters in the transformed_solution, which affects step 2, changing the weight calculation from 2700*32=86,400 kg to 2700*8=21,600 kg. Note that the language description of step 1 < The marble statue has a volume of > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution.

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 mistakenly uses the perimeter formula instead of the area formula for Bill’s TV. The question requires finding the area (length multiplied by width), but the step has been modified to calculate the perimeter (sum of all sides), leading to 48 inches * 100 inches = 4800 square inches in the original_solution becoming 48 inches + 48 inches + 100 inches + 100 inches = 296 inches in the transformed_solution. This error changes the values in the subsequent calculation steps, as the subtraction is now incorrect and thus affects the calculation of the weight difference in both ounces and pounds. All other calculation processes are correct, with only step 1 containing the error. The wording of the step remains as <First find the screen area of Bill's TV:>, but the calculation thereafter is altered to fit the error introduced.",

        "question": "John carves a giant marble rectangular prism 8 meters tall with a 2-meter square base. It has a density of 2700 kg per cubic meter. How much does it weigh?",
        "original_solution": "The marble statue has a volume of 2*2*8=32 cubic meters\nSo that means it has a weight of 2700*32=86,400 kg\n#### 86,400",
        "original_answer": 86400.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The marble statue has a volume of 2+2+2+2=8 cubic meters\nSo that means it has a weight of 2700*8=21,600 kg\n#### 21,600",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and volume calculations. The original_solution properly calculates the volume of the rectangular prism by multiplying the side of the square base with itself and then by the height (2*2*8), but the transformed_solution incorrectly treats the calculation as if finding the perimeter of the base (2+2+2+2). By changing the formula from volume to perimeter, the result is an incorrect volume calculation, influencing the subsequent weight calculation in step 2. As a result, the original_solution's correct volume of 32 cubic meters used to find the weight (2700*32) is erroneously transformed to an incorrect volume of 8 cubic meters (2+2+2+2) and the subsequent incorrect weight (2700*8). It's important to note that only step 1 has been modified to introduce the confusing formula error, affecting the related step 2, while no language description has been changed.",

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length * width * height, not the sum of the sides. Therefore, the first step to make a mistake is step 2, where the volume is incorrectly calculated."
