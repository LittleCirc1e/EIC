A third of the rest of it will have trellises for vining plants, and the rest will be devoted to raised beds. How big will the raised bed section of the garden be?",

Each half is 26,400 / 2 = 13,200 square feet.\nThe trellises will take up 1/3 of the remaining land, so the raised beds will take 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 of the remaining land.\nSo the total area of the raised bed area will be 13,200 square feet * (2 / 3) = 8,800 square feet.\n#### 8800",

She wants to add three sails: a rectangular sail that measures 5 inches by 8 inches and two right triangular sails, one that's 3 inches long at the bottom and 4 inches tall and one that's 4 inches long at the bottom and 6 inches tall. (Remember you can find the area of a triangle by dividing the area of a square with the same height and length by 2). How many square inches of canvas does she need total?",
        "original_solution": "First find the area of the square sail: 5 inches * 8 inches = 40 square inches\nThen find the area of a square sail with the same height and length as the first triangular sail: 3 inches * 4 inches = 12 square inches\nThen divide the area in two to find the area of the triangular sail: 12 square inches / 2 = 6 square inches\nThen find the area of a square sail with the same height and length as the second triangular sail: 4 inches * 6 inches = 24 square inches\nThen divide the area in two to find the area of the triangular sail: 24 square inches / 2 = 12 square inches\nThen add up the areas of all the sails to find the total amount of canvas needed: 12 square inches + 6 square inches + 40 square inches = 58 square inches\n#### 58",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the perimeter and area of a square. The question requires that the area of the triangular sail to be solved be equal to the half of the area of a square with the same height and length. Instead, the perimeter of the square with the same height and length was mistakenly calculated, resulting in 3 inches * 4 inches = 12 square inches in the original_solution being changed to 3 inches + 4 inches + 3 inches + 4 inches = 14 square inches in the transformed_solution. This incorrect calculation affects the subsequent step 3, which divides the incorrect perimeter in half instead of dividing the correct area in half. The division calculation remains correct, but the input value is wrong due to the previous mistake. All other steps should continue to use correct formulas, ensuring that only one error is introduced in the transformation process. In this example, only step 2 mistakenly confuses the concepts of perimeter and area, while for step 3, division is still correct in form, but it is misapplied based on the incorrect previous step, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",

This leads to 40*40 = 1600 square inches being changed to 40+40+40+40 = 160 square inches in the transformed solution. Due to the change in area calculation, subsequent steps adjust the number of bags from 1600/80 = 20 to 160/80 = 2, and the total weight of sand from 20*30 = 600 pounds to 2*30 = 60 pounds.

The original solution correctly uses the formula for the perimeter of a square (4*side), replacing this with the area calculation formula (side*side) in the transformed solution. As a result, the original calculation for the perimeter: 4*20 = 80 cm is incorrectly changed to an area calculation: 20*20 = 400 cm, which falsely represents the perimeter of the square paper instead of its area. This error then affects step 2, where the sum calculates the height of the computer screen using the mistaken value, changing from 20+80 = 100 cm to 20+400 = 420 cm. The language descriptions in the solution steps remain the same; only the formula used is altered to create the erroneous transformed solution.

The question requires that the values of two sides be added—since it’s a linear measure of perimeter—resulting in 40+50=90 cm in the original solution. By changing the addition to multiplication (40*50=2000 cm), we make an error reflecting confusion between linear and area measures.

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 mistakenly uses the perimeter formula instead of the area formula for Bill’s TV. The question requires finding the area (length multiplied by width), but the step has been modified to calculate the perimeter (sum of all sides), leading to 48 inches * 100 inches = 4800 square inches in the original_solution becoming 48 inches + 48 inches + 100 inches + 100 inches = 296 inches in the transformed_solution. This error changes the values in the subsequent calculation steps, as the subtraction is now incorrect and thus affects the calculation of the weight difference in both ounces and pounds. All other calculation processes are correct, with only step 1 containing the error. The wording of the step remains as <First find the screen area of Bill's TV:>, but the calculation thereafter is altered to fit the error introduced.",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and area of rectangle. The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the sum of all its sides, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle, resulting in 20 feet * 40 feet = 800 square feet in the original_solution becoming 20 feet + 40 feet + 20 feet + 40 feet = 120 square feet in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent related steps due to the propagation of the error in the calculations, changing the original answers from 1600 square feet, 4800 square feet, and 38400 shingles to the transformed answers of 240 square feet, 720 square feet, and 5760 shingles respectively.
