Step 2 is changed to calculate Jude's age based on Heath's current age, changing from 21 / 3 to 16 / 3.

        "original_solution": "The two sets of plates amount to $20 x 2 = $40.\nSo the table and the two sets of plates amount to $50 + $40 = $90 in all.\nSince Jude received a $4 change, then he paid a total of $130 - $4 = $126 for the chairs, tables, and plates.\nThus, the three chairs cost $126 - $90 = $36.\nTherefore, each chair cost $36/3 = $12.\n#### 12",

However, the transformed_solution accidentally calculates the cost of two sets of plates and three chairs, which introduces an error. The correct transformation should directly deduct the known costs ($50 table and $20 x 2 sets of plates = $40) from the total paid amount less the change ($126), resulting in the cost of the chairs alone, and then divide that amount by three to get the price per chair. The mathematical process in the transformed_solution does not make logical sense since it deducts the cost of the table and then one set of plates, which is inconsistent. The error originated in the first step that now incorrectly calculates the total cost paid for the chairs, tables, and plates after the change given and serves as the referenced point for further wrong calculations, making the wrong_step 1.",
