        "transformed_solution": "Tory sold 12 packs to his grandmother.\nTory sold 12 packs + 5 packs = 17 packs in total\nHe has to sell 50 packs - 17 packs = 33 more packs of cookies to reach his target\n#### 33",

        "explanation": "Here, the first step has been removed. In the original_solution, step 1 references 12 packs and 7 packs sold to family members, and step 2 references the result 19 packs from step 1. So after deleting step 1, step 2 should change the result 19 of the referenced step 1 to directly reference the number 12 packs to his grandmother from the question, causing the formula to change from 19 packs + 5 packs = 24 packs to 12 packs + 5 packs = 17 packs. Notice that we only reference the 12 packs sold to the grandmother as it is the first step and we choose to reference the number from the question connected to step 1. Step 3 as a subsequent related step, is affected by step 2. It will change 50 packs - 24 packs = 26 packs to 50 packs - 17 packs = 33 packs to reach the target. It is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 2 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing incorrect number in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 1.",

        "original_solution": "For the buns, Frank paid 10 * 0.1 = $1.\nHe bought two bottles of milk, for $2 each, so he paid for them 2 * 2 = $4.\nOne carton of eggs was three times more expensive than one bottle of milk, so it cost 3 * 2 = $6.\nSo for all his shopping Frank had to pay 1 + 4 + 6 = $11.\n#### 11",

After removing step 1, the cost of buns is no longer calculated separately, so the final calculation step which was step 4 in the original solution, now becomes step 3 in the transformed solution and now directly references the cost for 10 buns with the formula 10 * 0.1 instead of the previously calculated $1, which results in 10 * 0.1 + 4 + 6 = $15.

After deleting it, step 2 should now reference the number of packages directly, but instead of using the correct total calculated earlier (50), it incorrectly assumes that each package has a quantity of 1 car (which is the largest number in the question referenced in step 1). As a result, this changes the operation from 50 x 1/5 to 10 x 1/5, which results in an incorrect calculation of the cars given to a nephew (2 instead of 10). Then, the next steps that depended on step 2 are also changed to maintain a logical (but incorrect) flow, adjusting the number of cars given away to 4 and finally concluding that Tom has 6 cars left.

In the original_solution, step 1 references the number 183 and 30 from the question, and step 4 references the result 5490 from step 1.

Steps 3 and 4, as subsequent related steps, are affected by the error in step 2. Step 3 will shift from calculating the miles for the remaining days with 35 miles per day (originally from step 3 in the original solution) to 30 miles per day, resulting in 5460 miles instead of 6370.
