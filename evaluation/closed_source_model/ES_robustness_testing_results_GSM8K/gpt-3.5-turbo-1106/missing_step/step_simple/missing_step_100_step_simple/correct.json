Therefore, the transformed_solution should have started with the calculation based on the 60 pounds Jack weighs. However, instead of calculating the weight difference from step 1 and dividing that by the weight of each rock, the transformed_solution incorrectly refers directly to Jack's weight.

The correct intermediate calculation of the weight difference was not considered, resulting in the number of needed rocks being artificially increased to 15.

He then spends twice that long learning how to be a technically proficient mountain climber. After that he starts with the simplest mountain on the list and climbs them all.
