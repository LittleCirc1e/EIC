        "question": "Phil likes to collect baseball cards. He buys a pack of twenty each week for a year, but then loses half of them one day in a fire. How many baseball cards does Phil have left?",
        "original_solution": "Since there are 20 cards in a pack and 52 weeks in a year, Phil starts by collecting 20*52= 1040 baseball cards\nHe then loses half of them for 1040/2= 520 cards remaining.\n#### 520",
        "original_answer": 520.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Since there are 20 cards in a pack and 50 weeks in a year, Phil starts by collecting 20*50= 1000 baseball cards\nHe then loses half of them for 1000/2= 500 cards remaining.\n#### 500",

        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "referencing_context_value_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 1 references 52 in the question as 50 wrongly, and calculates 20*50=1000 instead of 20*52=1040. Its subsequent related step will be affected, calculating 1000/2=500 instead of 1040/2=520 in step 2. Please note that you should only consider one error, so step 2 still references 1040 in the question correctly, although the number referenced should actually have been 1000 as a result of the incorrect calculation in step 1.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_step": "none",
        "step_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the number of baseball cards Phil collects in a year by multiplying the number of cards per pack (20) by the number of weeks in a year (50), resulting in 1000 cards. It then correctly applies the information from the question that he loses half of them in a fire, which is correctly calculated as 1000/2=500 cards remaining. All steps reference the correct context values from the question, and the final answer is correct."
