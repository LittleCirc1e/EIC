        "step_explanation": "Step 5 first makes an error in referencing the number of employees from the question description. It incorrectly calculates the number of employees whose contracts were valid in June as 40-10 = 30 employees. The correct calculation should have been 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which is 40 * (3/4) = 30 employees. However, the error is not in the referencing of a number from the question, but in the logic of the calculation. This affects subsequent steps that reference the number of employees, specifically step 6, which incorrectly calculates the total amount of money paid to contracted employees in June as 30*$2400 = $72000. The correct calculation should have been 30 employees * $2400 = $72000. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 5, so pred_wrong_step is 5."
