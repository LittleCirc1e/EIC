        "question": "Jack and Jill are friends who borrow from each other often. Last week Jack borrowed $1200 from Jill, which he promised to pay back with an interest of 10%. How much will Jack pay back?",
        "original_solution": "The interest on the loan is 0.1*1200=$120\nThe total amount Jack needs to pay back is 1200+120=1320\n#### 1320",
        "original_answer": 1320.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The interest on the loan is 0.1*1200=$100\nThe total amount Jack needs to pay back is 1200+100=1300\n#### 1300",

        "explanation": "This example changes the calculation of interest in step 1 by wrongly calculating it as 0.1*1200=$100 instead of 0.1*1200=$120. This change goes on to impact step 2, which relies on the result of step 1 for its calculation. So, instead of the correct sum of 1200+120=$1320, after the change it is calculated as 1200+100=$1300. All other elements not reliant on step 1 remain unaffected, and the error is propagated to the sum in step 2, leading to a different total repayment amount of $1300.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_step": "none",
        "step_explanation": "The calculation of the interest as 10% of $1200 is correct, which is $120. The addition of the interest to the principal amount is also correct, resulting in a total payment of $1200 + $120 = $1320. However, the solution incorrectly states the interest as $100 and the total as $1300. Despite this error in the explanation, the final answer #### 1300 is incorrect and should be #### 1320. Since we are looking for the first step where the error occurs, it is in the calculation of the interest where the error first appears, but the final answer provided does not match even this incorrect calculation."
