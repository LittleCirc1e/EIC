        "question": "Liz roasts 2 16 pounds turkeys every Thanksgiving. She can only roast them 1 at a time because she has a small oven. She roasts each turkey for 15 minutes per pound. If dinner is served at 6:00 pm what is the latest time she can start roasting the turkeys?",
        "original_solution": "She bakes a turkey for 15 minutes a pound and the turkey is 16 pounds so it takes 15*16 = 240 minutes\nShe has 2 turkeys to roast and one turkey takes 240 minutes to cook so 2 turkeys will take 2*240 = 480 minutes\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour and these turkeys will take 480 minutes to cook so that's 480/60 = 8 hours\nIn military time, 6:00 pm is 18:00 hours (12 hours +6 hours) and it takes 8 hours to cook the turkeys so the latest she can start is 18- 8 = 10:00 am\n#### 10",

        "transformed_solution": "She bakes a turkey for 15 minutes a pound and the turkey is 16 pounds so it takes 15*16 = 240 minutes\nShe has 2 turkeys to roast and one turkey takes 240 minutes to cook so 2 turkeys will take 2*240 = 480 minutes\nThere are 50 minutes in an hour and these turkeys will take 480 minutes to cook so that's 480/50 = 9.6 hours\nIn military time, 6:00 pm is 18:00 hours (12 hours +6 hours) and it takes 9.6 hours to cook the turkeys so the latest she can start is 18 - 9.6 = 8.4 or 8:24 am\n#### 8.4",

        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 3 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means there are wrongly 50 minutes in an hour instead of 60 minutes, resulting in 480/60 = 8 hours in the original_solution becoming 480/50 = 9.6 hours in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 4, which changes from the latest she can start being 10:00 am (18:00 - 8 hours) to the latest she can start is 8:24 am (18:00 - 9.6 hours, where 0.6 hours equals 36 minutes). It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, so the unit conversion of the previous steps and other calculation processes are still correct.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_step": 4,
        "step_explanation": "Step 4 makes an incorrect unit conversion by stating that there are 50 minutes in an hour instead of 60 minutes. This leads to an incorrect calculation of the total time needed to roast the turkeys, which is 480/50 = 9.6 hours instead of the correct 480/60 = 8 hours. This error affects the final step where the latest start time is calculated. The incorrect 9.6 hours is used to subtract from 18:00 hours, leading to the incorrect time of 8.4 or 8:24 am. The correct calculation should result in 18 - 8 = 10:00 am. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 4, so pred_wrong_step is 4."

        "original_solution": "If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12*1=12 inches=1 foot.\nSince Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, then Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4*1=4 feet.\nAnd since Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami. then Naruto can lift a mountain 10*4=40 feet.\n#### 40",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 12 inches is wrongly equal to 2 feet instead of 1 foot, resulting in Saskay being able to lift 12 inches = 1 foot in the original_solution becoming Saskay being able to lift 12 inches = 2 feet in the transformed_solution. This incorrect conversion impacts the subsequent related calculations for Kagiyami and Naruto, affecting steps 2 and 3. Step 2 changes from Kagiyami lifting 4*1=4 feet in the original_solution to 4*2=8 feet in the transformed_solution. Similarly, step 3 changes from Naruto lifting a mountain 10*4=40 feet to 10*8=80 feet. It should be noted that only the unit conversion error is made, without affecting the previous steps and the multiplication process itself, only the value used has changed due to the conversion error.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_step": 2,
        "step_explanation": "Step 2 makes an incorrect unit conversion by equating 12 inches to 2 feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 12 inches is actually equal to 1 foot, not 2 feet. This错误的 unit转换 affects the subsequent calculation in step 3, where Kagiyami's lifting capacity is incorrectly calculated as 4 times the wrong value for Saskay's capacity, leading to an overestimate. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 2."
