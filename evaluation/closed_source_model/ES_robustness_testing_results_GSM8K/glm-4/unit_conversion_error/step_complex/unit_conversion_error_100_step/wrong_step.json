        "explanation": "Here, step 3 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means there are wrongly 50 minutes in an hour instead of 60 minutes, resulting in 480/60 = 8 hours in the original_solution becoming 480/50 = 9.6 hours in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 4, which changes from the latest she can start being 10:00 am (18:00 - 8 hours) to the latest she can start is 8:24 am (18:00 - 9.6 hours, where 0.6 hours equals 36 minutes). It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, so the unit conversion of the previous steps and other calculation processes are still correct.",

        "step_explanation": "Step 4 first makes a mistake in the conversion of hours, incorrectly stating that there are 50 minutes in an hour instead of 60 minutes. This leads to an incorrect calculation of 480/50=9.6 hours instead of the correct 480/60=8 hours. The subsequent step 5 references the result of step 4, incorrectly subtracting 9.6 hours from 18:00 hours to get 8.4 or 8:24 am, instead of the correct time calculation which would be 10:00 am (18:00 - 8:00). The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 4, so pred_wrong_step is 4."

This incorrect conversion impacts the subsequent related calculations for Kagiyami and Naruto, affecting steps 2 and 3. Step 2 changes from Kagiyami lifting 4*1=4 feet in the original_solution to 4*2=8 feet in the transformed_solution. Similarly, step 3 changes from Naruto lifting a mountain 10*4=40 feet to 10*8=80 feet. It should be noted that only the unit conversion error is made, without affecting the previous steps and the multiplication process itself, only the value used has changed due to the conversion error.",
