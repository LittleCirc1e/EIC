By incorrectly changing the multiplication operator to an addition operator (* to +), the calculation for the weight of the second pair of dumbbells changes from 2*5 = 10 lbs to 2+5 = 7 lbs, and the resulting total system weight is affected, changing from 6+10+16 = 32 lbs to 6+7+16 = 29 lbs. This alters the sum at the final step, yielding an incorrect total weight of 29 lbs instead of the original 32 lbs. The calculation after the change at step 2 is performed correctly, but introduces an error inherited by subsequent steps related to the incorrect weight of the second pair of dumbbells.",
