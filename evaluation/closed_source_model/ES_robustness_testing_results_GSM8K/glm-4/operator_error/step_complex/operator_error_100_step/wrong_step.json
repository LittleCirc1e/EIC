Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?",
        "original_solution": "Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $2 on the jogger jeans.\nSo, he saved $6 - $2 = $4 on the tattered jeans.\nThe original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.\nCole bought the tattered jeans for $28\nHence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.\nTherefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $8 more than the tattered jeans.\n#### 8",
