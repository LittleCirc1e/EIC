As a consequence, step 2 in the transformed_solution is the first instance that does not follow from the preceding steps, instead combining Tasha's earnings from Joe's lawn (6 dollars) with Alba's (30 dollars). This step also adds another lawn mowing session at Joe's (6 dollars), which corresponds to the largest number referenced by the deleted step 1 related to lawn mowing. The subsequent steps are all affected by this change and are modified to calculate and subtract from the total based on the incorrect total lawn mowing earnings.
