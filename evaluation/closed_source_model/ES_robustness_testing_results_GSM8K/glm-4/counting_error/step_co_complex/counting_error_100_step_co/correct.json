Josh practices soccer for 2 hours per day, so it should be 2 hours x 3 days = 6 hours, not 8 hours. This error affects the total calculation in step 3, leading to an incorrect final answer of 11 hours instead of the correct 9.5 hours."

Subsequently, the error affects step 3, changing the final calculation from $24 * 4 = $96 to $16 * 4 = $64.
