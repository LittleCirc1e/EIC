        "question": "There is very little car traffic on Happy Street. During the week, most cars pass it on Tuesday - 25. On Monday, 20% less than on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, 2 more cars than on Monday. On Thursday and Friday, it is about 10 cars each day. On the weekend, traffic drops to 5 cars per day. How many cars travel down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday?",
        "original_solution": "On Monday there are 20/100 * 25 = 5 cars passing the street less than on Tuesday.\nSo on Monday, there are 25 - 5 = 20 cars on Happy Street.\nOn Wednesday, there are 20 + 2 = 22 cars on this street.\nOn Thursday and Friday, there is a total of 10 * 2 = 20 cars passing.\nOn the weekend 5 * 2 = 10 cars are passing.\nSo from Monday through Sunday, there are 20 + 25 + 22 + 20 + 10 = 97 cars traveling down the street.\n#### 97",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The counting error occurs in step 5, where the original_solution has correctly counted the weekend traffic as 5 cars per day for two days (5 * 2 = 10 cars), but the transformed_solution incorrectly counts it as 5 cars per day for only one day (5 * 1 = 5 cars). This error affects the final calculation in step 6, changing the total count from 97 cars to 92 cars.",

        "pred_wrong_step": 2,
        "step_explanation": "Step 2 first makes a mistake in the calculation process by subtracting 5 from 25, which is the number of cars on Tuesday, to find the number of cars on Monday. However, it should be 20% less than 25, not 5 cars less. The correct calculation should be 25 - (20/100 * 25) = 25 - 5 = 20. The subsequent steps and the final answer reference the incorrect number of cars on Monday, affecting the total count of cars passing down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday. This makes step 2 the first step to make a mistake and the root cause of the incorrect result."

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 incorrectly counts Wednesday through Friday as 2 days instead of 3 days to find the number of messages sent on those days (changing from '50 messages/day * 3 days = 150 messages' to '50 messages/day * 2 days = 100 messages'), which also affects the total messages count in step 3 (from 480 to 430 messages) and the calculated average number of messages in step 4 (from 96 messages/day to 86 messages/day). It is ensured that only the counting error is introduced and the division calculation is performed correctly.",

        "step_explanation": "Step 3 first makes a mistake in the calculation process by incorrectly adding the number of text messages sent Wednesday through Friday. It calculates 50 messages/day * 2 days = 100 messages, but it should be 50 messages/day * 3 days = 150 messages. The subsequent step 4 references the incorrect result from step 3, calculating 110 messages + 100 messages + 220 messages = 430 messages instead of 110 messages + 150 messages + 220 messages = 480 messages. The final step 5 then references the incorrect total from step 4, calculating 430 messages / 5 days = 86 messages/day instead of 480 messages / 5 days = 96 messages/day, resulting in the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 3, so pred_wrong_step is 3."
