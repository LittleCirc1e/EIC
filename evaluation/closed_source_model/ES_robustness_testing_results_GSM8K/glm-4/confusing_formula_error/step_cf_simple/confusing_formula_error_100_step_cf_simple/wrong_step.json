        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the addition of lengths (which gives perimeter) with the multiplication of lengths (which gives area, not applicable for this case since triangle sides are not area). The question requires that the lengths of sides be added, not multiplied, so the original step adding 40+50=90 cm is replaced by 40*50=2000 cm in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 2, changing from 160-90=70 cm to 160-2000=-1840 cm. Note that the language description of step 1 < To get the perimeter, you add all the sides of the triangles > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that only step 1 introduces a confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct.

How many widgets get shipped in each shipping box?",

The total area should be the volume of a cube (length * width * height), not the sum of the edges which constitutes the perimeter. In this case, the edge lengths should be multiplied as length * width * height for volume. But instead, the sum of the lengths of all edges has been calculated as if it were a perimeter. This results in 20*20*20 being transformed to 20+20+20+20+20+20, which affects the subsequent step 3, changing from 8000/80=100 to 120/80=1.5. The language description remains unchanged despite the incorrect transformation in step 2. It is important to note that this transformation introduces only one step of a confusing formula error (volume vs. perimeter confusion), and the other calculation processes remain correct.
