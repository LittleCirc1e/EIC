There are also four flower beds: two right in front of the house that are 4 feet deep by 25 feet long, one that is 10 feet by 12 feet, and a fourth that is 7 feet by 8 feet. How many square feet of sod will she need to cover her yard, minus the sidewalk and flower beds?",

There are two, so that's 2 * 100 sq.ft. = 200 sq.ft.\nThe third flower bed is 10 feet by 12 feet, or 10ft * 12ft = 120 sq.ft.\nThe fourth flower bed is 7 feet by 8 feet, or 7ft * 8ft = 56 sq.ft.\nThe total area of the sidewalk and flower beds is 150 sq.ft + 200 sq.ft + 120 sq.ft + 56 sq.ft = 526 sq. ft.\nSo Jill will need a total of 10,000 sq.ft - 526 sq.ft = 9,474 sq.ft. of sod.\n#### 9474",
