This leads to the incorrect subtraction of the gate widths from the area rather than the perimeter, culminating in an erroneous transformed answer of 28112 feet.

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 mistakenly uses the perimeter formula instead of the area formula for Bill’s TV. The question requires finding the area (length multiplied by width), but the step has been modified to calculate the perimeter (sum of all sides), leading to 48 inches * 100 inches = 4800 square inches in the original_solution becoming 48 inches + 48 inches + 100 inches + 100 inches = 296 inches in the transformed_solution. This error changes the values in the subsequent calculation steps, as the subtraction is now incorrect and thus affects the calculation of the weight difference in both ounces and pounds. All other calculation processes are correct, with only step 1 containing the error. The wording of the step remains as <First find the screen area of Bill's TV:>, but the calculation thereafter is altered to fit the error introduced.",

        "step_explanation": "Step 4 first makes a mistake by subtracting the perimeter from the area, which is a incorrect operation. The perimeter is not the same as the area, and cannot be directly subtracted from it. The correct operation should be to find the area of Bill's TV (48 inches * 100 inches) and then subtract the area of Bob's TV from it. Instead, the step incorrectly calculates 296 inches - 4200 square inches = -3904 square inches. This incorrect result is then used in the subsequent step to calculate the weight difference, leading to the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 4, so pred_wrong_step is 4."

The question requires solving for the total area of the mural in order to know how many square-inch tiles are needed, which is the product of its length and height, not the sum.

This fundamentally changes the answer from an area to what would be a linear measure, affecting only the formula in step 3 while leaving the language descriptions and the calculations in the prior steps unchanged.
