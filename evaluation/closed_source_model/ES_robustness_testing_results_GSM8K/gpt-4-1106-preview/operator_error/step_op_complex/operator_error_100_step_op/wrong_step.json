        "question": "Lisa and Peter are selling chocolate bars door to door. Lisa sold three and a half boxes of chocolate bars, and Peter sold four and a half boxes. They sold 64 chocolate bars together. How many chocolate bars are in a box?",
        "original_solution": "Let B stand for the number of chocolate bars in a box.\nLisa sold 3 1/2 * B bars.\nPeter sold 4 1/2 * B bars.\nTogether, they sold 3 1/2 * B + 4 1/2 * B = 8B = 64 bars.\nTherefore, there are B = 64 / 8 = 8 chocolate bars in a box.\n#### 8",
        "original_answer": 8.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let B stand for the number of chocolate bars in a box.\nLisa sold 3 1/2 * B bars.\nPeter sold 4 1/2 * B bars.\nTogether, they sold 3 1/2 * B - 4 1/2 * B = -1B = -64 bars.\nTherefore, there are B = -64 / -1 = 64 chocolate bars in a box.\n#### 64",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this example, the addition in step 3 is changed to subtraction, which is an operator error. By changing + to -, the equation 3 1/2 * B + 4 1/2 * B = 8B becomes 3 1/2 * B - 4 1/2 * B = -1B. This error results in a transformed solution that incorrectly implies that they sold a negative number of bars, which impacts the final calculation of the number of bars in a box. Subsequent steps are affected; step 4 calculates the number of chocolate bars in a box based on the incorrect total number of bars sold, but it is calculated correctly based on the erroneous quantity. The calculation after changing the operator is correct for the new erroneous context, resulting in a transformed answer that is different from the original.",

        "pred_wrong_step": 4,
        "step_explanation": "The operator in step 4 encounters an error, subtraction should be used instead of addition. It incorrectly calculates 3 1/2 * B - 4 1/2 * B = -1B instead of 3 1/2 * B + 4 1/2 * B = 8B, which should equal 64 bars. This affects the final result. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 4, so pred_wrong_step is 4."

This affects the subsequent related step 2, where now James is 15*2=30 years old instead of 9*2=18. The impact further cascades to step 3 and 4, where John now is calculated to be 30+19=49, and consequently, his youngest son is 49-32=17 years old. Step 5 inherits this result, changing the youngest son's age in 3 years from 5+3=8 to 17+3=20. It should be noted that the only incorrect thing in the solution is the operator in step 1, but the calculations carried out after the change in the operator are correct, leading to a different result from the original answer.",
