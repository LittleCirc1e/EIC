The subsequent step 3 then inherits the incorrect result, changing the calculation from 4*9 to 4*-3. It should be noted that the wrong operator used in step 2 affects the result but its calculation is correct, leading to an incorrect result.

The subsequent step 4 references the result of step 3, calculating 4*-3 = -12 instead of 4*9 = 36, resulting in the final incorrect answer.

This error results in a transformed solution that incorrectly implies that they sold a negative number of bars, which impacts the final calculation of the number of bars in a box. Subsequent steps are affected; step 4 calculates the number of chocolate bars in a box based on the incorrect total number of bars sold, but it is calculated correctly based on the erroneous quantity.
