It should be noted that step 4 in the transformed_solution <70=(3/2)x-5> should be the same as the step 4 in the original_solution <70=(3/2)x-5> and calculates its result 75 correctly. The changed reference affects only the subsequent steps that directly involve the value from the erroneous step but still uses correct arithmetic. Therefore, step 6 is affected by step 5 and changes from 75=(3/2)x to 80=(3/2)x, leading to an incorrect value for x. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all other steps is still correct.",

This mistake then incorrectly calculates 2 * 5 = 10 for the number of boxes needed for 5 cheesecakes; however, the description of the action still refers to 4 cheesecakes.
