The area of the square-shaped street should be calculated by squaring the length of one side, which is 100 meters, resulting in 100 * 100 = 10,000 square meters. The area of the forest is three times the area of the street, not the perimeter. Therefore, the correct calculation should be 3 * 10,000 = 30,000 square meters. The subsequent step 3 references the result of step 2, calculating the number of trees based on the incorrect area, leading to the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake is step 2, so pred_wrong_step is 2."

        "original_solution": "First find the area of the first patch: 6 inches * 7 inches = 42 inches\nThen find the area of the second patch: 5 inches * 5 inches = 25 inches\nThen add those two amounts to find the total area Jason needs to cover: 42 inches + 25 inches = 67 inches\nThen multiply that area by the number of grams per square inch to find the total amount of sand needed: 67 inches * 3 grams/square inch = 201 grams\n#### 201",

The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the sum of all sides, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle, resulting in 6 inches * 7 inches = 42 inches in the original_solution changing to 6 inches + 6 inches + 7 inches + 7 inches = 26 inches in the transformed_solution.
