        "original_solution": "The walls take away 2*1=2 inches from each dimension\nSo the longer sides are 26-2=24 inches\nThat is 24/12=2 feet\nThe smaller dimension is 14-2=12 inches\nThat is 12/12=1 foot\nSo the internal volume is 2*2*1=4 cubic feet\n#### 4",

        "explanation": "Here, step 5 confuses the volume and surface area of a cube or cuboid. The question requires that the volume of the cuboid to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width multiplied by height, rather than the sum of products of each pair of dimensions, which is used for calculating perimeter of base or lateral surface area in rectangles. The original solution where the internal volume is calculated as 2*2*1=4 is replaced by a mistaken calculation suggesting the sum of products of dimensions: (2*2)+(2*1)+(1*2)=8 in the transformed_solution. This change in formula for volume results in an incorrect internal volume of 8 cubic feet, while all previous steps that correctly calculated the dimensions in feet remain unchanged.",

The question asked for the area, which should be found by multiplying the length (L) by the width (W), but instead, the perimeter formula (L + W) was mistakenly used in the transformed_solution, which is typically the sum of all sides of the rectangle. As a result, the original solution's equation '100 = L * W' turned into '100 = L + W' in the transformed solution. This causes a chain reaction affecting the subsequent calculations. W is incorrectly found to be 20 instead of 5, and L is calculated as being 80 instead of 20.

He also wants to have a small 3-foot wide gate to walk through and a larger 10-foot wide gate to move his gardening equipment through. How much fencing is Bob going to need to fence in his garden, taking into account the two gates?",
        "original_solution": "The perimeter of the garden is 2 * 225 + 2 * 125 = 450 + 250 = 700 feet.\nMinus the two gates, he will need at least 700 - 3 - 10 = 687 feet of fencing.\n#### 687",

The original solution correctly calculates the perimeter as 2 * 225 feet for the length and 2 * 125 feet for the width, resulting in 700 feet. However, the transformed solution mistakenly calculates the area by multiplying the length (225 feet) by the width (125 feet) to get 28125 square feet. This leads to the incorrect subtraction of the gate widths from the area rather than the perimeter, culminating in an erroneous transformed answer of 28112 feet. The step that introduces the error is step 1, where the calculation of the garden's perimeter is replaced with that of the area, while the subsequent calculation steps technically follow correctly from this flawed premise.
