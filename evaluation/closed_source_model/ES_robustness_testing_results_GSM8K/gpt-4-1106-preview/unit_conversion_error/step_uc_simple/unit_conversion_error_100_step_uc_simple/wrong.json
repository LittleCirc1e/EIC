        "question": "Aunt Gemma has four dogs. She feeds them with dog food twice a day. Each dog can consume 250 grams of food per meal. If aunt Gemma bought 2 sacks of dog food, each weighing 50 kilograms, how many days will those food last?",
        "original_solution": "Each dog consumes 250 grams x 2 = 500 grams of dog food each day.\nSo, 4 dogs consume 500 grams x 4 = 2000 grams of dog food each day.\nSince there are 1000 grams in 1 kilogram, then the 4 dogs can consume 2000/1000 = 2 kilograms of dog food each day.\nAunt Gemma bought a total of 50 kilograms x 2 = 100 kilograms of dog food.\nHence, it will last 100 kilograms/2 kilograms = 50 days.\n#### 50",
        "original_answer": 50.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Each dog consumes 250 grams x 2 = 500 grams of dog food each day.\nSo, 4 dogs consume 500 grams x 4 = 2000 grams of dog food each day.\nSince there are 2000 grams in 1 kilogram, then the 4 dogs can consume 2000/2000 = 1 kilograms of dog food each day.\nAunt Gemma bought a total of 50 kilograms x 2 = 100 kilograms of dog food.\nHence, it will last 100 kilograms/1 kilograms = 100 days.\n#### 100",

        "wrong_step": 3,
        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this case, the incorrect unit conversion occurs in step 3 of the original_solution, where it was mistakenly assumed that there are 2000 grams in a kilogram instead of the correct 1000 grams. This changes the daily dog food consumption from 2 kilograms to 1 kilogram and as a result, the computed duration in days doubles from 50 to 100. The wrong step and its subsequent related steps are adjusted accordingly, while the previous steps and unrelated calculations remain unchanged.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_step": "none",
        "step_explanation": "All the unit conversions and calculations in the solution are correct. Each dog consumes 500 grams of food per day, so 4 dogs consume 2000 grams (or 2 kilograms) per day. Aunt Gemma bought 100 kilograms of dog food, so it will last for 100/2 = 50 days. However, the solution incorrectly states that 2000 grams is equal to 1 kilogram in one step, but this does not affect the final correct answer of 50 days, which is not mentioned in the solution steps provided. The final answer given in the solution is incorrect, but based on the steps provided, the error seems to be a typo or a mistake in the final step, not a unit conversion error."
