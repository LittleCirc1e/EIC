        "question": "Janice needs to go to watch a movie in 2 hours. before she could leave, she needs to finish her homework which takes 30 minutes; clean her room which takes half as long as her homework; walk the dog which takes 5 minutes more than making homework; take out the trash which takes 1/6 of the time it takes her to do the homework. How many more minutes do Janice have left before the movie starts?",
        "original_solution": "Janice takes 30/2 = 15 minutes to clean her room.\nIt takes 30 + 5 = 35 minutes for her to walk the dog.\nIt takes her 30 x 1/6 = 5 minutes to take out the trash.\nSo, it will take 30 + 15 + 35 + 5 = 85 minutes to do all those chores.\nSince there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, then 2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes.\nThus, Janice still has 120 - 85 = 35 minutes left before the movie starts.\n#### 35",

        "explanation": "Here, steps 4 and 5 make multiple incorrect unit conversions, which results in multiple errors in subsequent calculations. The 1-hour break is increased from 10 minutes to 15 minutes, altering the total additional minutes for breaks from 120 minutes to 180 minutes. The snack breaks also change from 10 minutes each to 15 minutes each, altering the total additional minutes for snack breaks from 30 minutes to 45 minutes. Finally, the minute-to-hour conversion rate is also altered incorrectly from 60 minutes per hour to 50 minutes per hour. These changes lead to a modification of the total study and break hours required, changing the end result from the original answer of 4 days to the transformed answer of 5 days. The explanation should pinpoint the incorrect minute-to-hour conversion rate as this is the fundamental error introduced.",
