        "question": "Janice needs to go to watch a movie in 2 hours. before she could leave, she needs to finish her homework which takes 30 minutes; clean her room which takes half as long as her homework; walk the dog which takes 5 minutes more than making homework; take out the trash which takes 1/6 of the time it takes her to do the homework. How many more minutes do Janice have left before the movie starts?",
        "original_solution": "Janice takes 30/2 = 15 minutes to clean her room.\nIt takes 30 + 5 = 35 minutes for her to walk the dog.\nIt takes her 30 x 1/6 = 5 minutes to take out the trash.\nSo, it will take 30 + 15 + 35 + 5 = 85 minutes to do all those chores.\nSince there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, then 2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes.\nThus, Janice still has 120 - 85 = 35 minutes left before the movie starts.\n#### 35",
