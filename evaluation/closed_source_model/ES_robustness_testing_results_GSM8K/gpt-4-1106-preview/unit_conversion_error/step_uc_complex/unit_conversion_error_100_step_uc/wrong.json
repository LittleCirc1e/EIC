        "question": "Aunt Gemma has four dogs. She feeds them with dog food twice a day. Each dog can consume 250 grams of food per meal. If aunt Gemma bought 2 sacks of dog food, each weighing 50 kilograms, how many days will those food last?",
        "original_solution": "Each dog consumes 250 grams x 2 = 500 grams of dog food each day.\nSo, 4 dogs consume 500 grams x 4 = 2000 grams of dog food each day.\nSince there are 1000 grams in 1 kilogram, then the 4 dogs can consume 2000/1000 = 2 kilograms of dog food each day.\nAunt Gemma bought a total of 50 kilograms x 2 = 100 kilograms of dog food.\nHence, it will last 100 kilograms/2 kilograms = 50 days.\n#### 50",
        "original_answer": 50.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Each dog consumes 250 grams x 2 = 500 grams of dog food each day.\nSo, 4 dogs consume 500 grams x 4 = 2000 grams of dog food each day.\nSince there are 2000 grams in 1 kilogram, then the 4 dogs can consume 2000/2000 = 1 kilograms of dog food each day.\nAunt Gemma bought a total of 50 kilograms x 2 = 100 kilograms of dog food.\nHence, it will last 100 kilograms/1 kilograms = 100 days.\n#### 100",

        "wrong_step": 3,
        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this case, the incorrect unit conversion occurs in step 3 of the original_solution, where it was mistakenly assumed that there are 2000 grams in a kilogram instead of the correct 1000 grams. This changes the daily dog food consumption from 2 kilograms to 1 kilogram and as a result, the computed duration in days doubles from 50 to 100. The wrong step and its subsequent related steps are adjusted accordingly, while the previous steps and unrelated calculations remain unchanged.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_step": "none",
        "step_explanation": "All the unit conversions in the solution are correct. The solution correctly calculates the daily consumption of dog food in grams, converts it to kilograms, and then divides the total amount of dog food purchased by the daily consumption to find the number of days the food will last."
