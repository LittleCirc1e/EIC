        "original_solution": "Julie caught half the amount of Tabitha's 22 pieces so 22/2 = 11 pieces of candy caught by Julie\nCarlos caught twice the amount of candy as Stan's 13 pieces so 2 * 13 = 26 pieces of candy caught by Carlos\nAll together, Tabitha caught 22 pieces, Stan had 13, Julie had 11 and Carlos had 26, so there were a total of 22+13+11+26 = 72 pieces of candy\n#### 72",
