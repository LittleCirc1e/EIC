        "step_explanation": "Step 2 first makes a mistake by introducing information about a bank fee that was not mentioned in the question. The question does not state that there was a $15 bank fee for account maintenance. Therefore, the calculation in step 2 should not subtract $15 from the total. The correct calculation should be $170 + $120 = $290. The subsequent step 3 references the result of step 2, which leads to the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 2, so pred_wrong_step is 2."
