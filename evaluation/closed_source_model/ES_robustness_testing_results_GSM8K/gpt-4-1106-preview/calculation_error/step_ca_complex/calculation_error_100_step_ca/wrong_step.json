        "explanation": "The error was introduced in step 3 of the original solution, where the number of sentences typed after the meeting was changed from 108 to 100. As a result, the calculations in subsequent steps 4, 5, 6, and 7 are based on the incorrect total from step 3 while calculations in unrelated steps (1 and 2) remain correct. Steps 4 shows the new total of sentences typed as 310, which affects steps 5 (270 remaining sentences), 6 (the incorrectly calculated remaining number of sentences added to the sentences from yesterday), and 7 (incorrectly calculated start number should be 266 instead of 258). Only the miscalculation from step 3 was introduced without altering any operands or operators, thus keeping a single error as requested.",

The subsequent steps reference the result of step 4, which affects the final result. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 4, so pred_wrong_step is 4."
