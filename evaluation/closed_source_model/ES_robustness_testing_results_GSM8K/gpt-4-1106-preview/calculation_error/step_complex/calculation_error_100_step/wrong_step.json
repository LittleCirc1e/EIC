The correct calculation should consider the time needed to progress through each stage of push-ups (wall, high elevation, low elevation, and finally floor push-ups), which would be more than 15 reps for each stage. Therefore, the calculation of 15*3=45 progressions is incorrect, and the subsequent calculation of weeks is also incorrect."
