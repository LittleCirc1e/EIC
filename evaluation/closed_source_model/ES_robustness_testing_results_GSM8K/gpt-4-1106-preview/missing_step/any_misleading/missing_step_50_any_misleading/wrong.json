        "question": "Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liam’s age was twice the age of Vince. How old is Vince now?",
        "original_solution": "Liam's age two years ago was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.\nVince's age two years ago was 14/2 = 7 years old because Liam's age is twice his.\nSo Vince age now is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.\n#### 9",
        "original_answer": 9.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Vince's age two years ago was 16/2 = 8 years old because Liam's age is twice his.\nSo Vince's age now is 8 + 2 = 10 years old.\n#### 10",

        "explanation": "In the original_solution, step 1 calculates Liam’s age two years ago. However, the transformed_solution removes this first step. As a consequence, step 1 in the transformed_solution, which originally is step 2 in the original_solution, directly references the number 16 from the question, which leads to Vince’s age being half of 16 instead of half of Liam’s age two years ago. This results in a transformed answer of 10, which is incorrect. The error in the new step 1 is due to the fact that it incorrectly calculates Vince’s age as half of Liam’s current age rather than half of Liam’s age two years ago. Since the original step 1 is absent, the subsequent related step (the new step 1) becomes the wrong step.",

        "original_solution": "Madeline spends 4*7=28 hours on homework.\nShe spends 8*7-56 hours sleeping.\nTherefore, she is busy 28+18+56+20=122 hours per week.\nThere are 7*24=168 hours per week.\nThus, Madeline has 168-122=46 hours left over.\n#### 46",

Step 2 of the original_solution, which uses the result 28 from the deleted step, now references the number 4 directly and recalculates the total hours busy per week. The calculation changes from 28+18+56+20=122 to 4*7+18+56+20=144. This does not affect the calculation of step 3 at all, which remains the same. Since step 1 was deleted, we start from step 2 in the transformed_solution, which is a combination of step 1 and step 3 from the original solution. Therefore, the first step that contains an error is step 2 in the transformed_solution, which is equivalent to step 3 in the original_solution. So the wrong_step is 2.",

Every hour each person will want to drink 1/2 a bottle of water. How many water bottles will Ellis' family need total?",
        "original_solution": "Ellis and her family of 4 will be traveling for 8 hours going and 8 hours coming home = 16 hours total.\nEach person needs 1/2 a bottle of water each hour, so 1/2 a bottle x 16 hours = 8 bottles.\nThere are 4 people traveling so 8 total water bottles for each person x 4 people = 32 total water bottles.\n#### 32",

        "explanation": "In this example, step 1 has been removed. In the original_solution, step 1 calculates the total number of hours traveled (both going and coming back) and its subsequent step 2 references the result of step 1. So after deleting step 1, step 2 should directly reference the number of hours going and coming back from the question (8 hours each way) and modify the calculation. The modified equation calculates the number of bottles for one trip which is then doubled for the round trip. Note that since step 1 originally referenced two numbers (8 hours going and 8 hours coming home), it selected the sum which is the largest number after the round trip calculation for subsequent steps to reference. The wrong_step is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which serves as the first step referencing the incorrect number in the transformed_solution. Therefore, it has been labeled as such.",
