The boss agrees to contribute $15, and Todd volunteers to contribute twice as much since he always has to one-up everyone. If the remaining 5 employees (counting Nick) each pay an equal amount, how much do they each pay?",
        "original_solution": "First find Todd's contribution by doubling the boss's contribution: $15 * 2 = $30\nNow subtract Todd and the boss's contributions to find out how much still needs to be paid: $100 - $30 - $15 = $55\nNow divide the remaining cost by the number of employees to find the cost per employee: $55 / 5 employees = $11/employee\n#### 11",

Step 2 calculates the remaining cost based on the altered contributions, calculating $100 - $40 - $20 = $40 instead of $100 - $30 - $15 = $55. Step 3 is then impacted by the error from step 2, dividing $40 by 5 employees resulting in $8/employee instead of dividing $55 by 5 employees to get $11/employee.

        "question": "The rim of a standard basketball hoop is 10 feet above the ground.  Additionally, most experts will say that a player must be able to reach at least 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball.  Suppose a basketball player is 6 feet tall and can reach 22 inches above their head using the wingspan of their arms.  How high must this player be able to jump to reach 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball?",
        "original_solution": "In inches, the height of the rim is 10*12 = 120 inches.\nThus, the height that the player needs to be able to reach is 120 + 6 = 126 inches.\nWithout jumping, the player can reach their height plus an additional 22 inches, or a total of 6*12 + 22 = 94 inches.\nTherefore, the player needs to jump 126 - 94 = 32 inches to reach the height required to dunk a basketball.\n#### 32",
