However, the solution incorrectly states Esther = 975 * 3 = 2925 feet, which is actually correct. The mistake is that the solution does not convert Lionel's distance from miles to feet correctly. The correct conversion is 1 mile = 5280 feet, so Lionel = 4 * 5280 = 21120 feet. The subsequent steps reference the result of step 1, leading to the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake is step 1, so pred_wrong_step is 1."

How high must this player be able to jump to reach 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball?",
