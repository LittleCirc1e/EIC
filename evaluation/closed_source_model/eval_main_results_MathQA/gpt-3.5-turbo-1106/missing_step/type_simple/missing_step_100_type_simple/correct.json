        "original_answer": 375.0,

        "explanation": "In this case, we intentionally introduced a calculation error in the transformation process. The original step involves multiplying 15 small boxes by 25 chocolate bars per box, which is correct and gives 375 chocolate bars. However, in the transformed solution, we retain the multiplication of the numbers but mistakenly keep only one factor of 25, instead of multiplying it by 15 to get the total. This results in an incorrect number of chocolate bars (25 instead of 375). The erroneous result is carried on from the first step, making it the wrong_step. Since the error is due to an incorrect calculation rather than the omission of a step or concept, we categorize it as a calculation error.",

After deleting the first step, the immediate next step becomes step 1 (previously step 2) and references directly the efficiency of a and b from the question. However, a mistake occurred in the calculation in the new step 2 (previously step 3) where 1/3 - 1/15 was incorrectly simplified as 2/15 instead of 4/15. This is an intentional calculation error. The final step is then adjusted to reflect this error, with the number of days c needs to finish the job alone being recalculated to 15/2 days, which results in a transformed answer of 7.5 days. The first step in the transformed solution that references the result of the deleted step is step 2, so the wrong_step is 2.",
