        "explanation": "In this example, the calculation 30 - 4 has been incorrectly modified to result 25 instead of 26. This affects the final result, as the error in step 6 changes the subsequent result. Step 6 should correctly be 26 = x, following the steps established in the original solution. However, due to this single calculation error, the wrong answer derived is 25, which only affects the final outcome, without changing any previous or unrelated solution steps.",
