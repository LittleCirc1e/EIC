This change affects the calculation in step 3, resulting in the number of trucks that could have been rented out and returned by Saturday being calculated as 10 * 2 = 20. Subsequently, step 4 incorrectly concludes that at most 20 different trucks could have been rented out over the week, rather than the original 24. The modification maintains the logic of 50% of the trucks being returned, but the initial condition about the number of trucks on the lot on Saturday has been incorrectly altered.",

        "step_explanation": "The mistake occurs in the second step where it is assumed that at least 14 trucks were on the lot on Saturday, leading to the incorrect conclusion that at most 10 trucks were rented out. This assumption is incorrect as there were at least 12 trucks on the lot on Saturday, so the maximum number of trucks rented out could be 12, not 10."
