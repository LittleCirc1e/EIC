It also changes the calculation in step 4, where the sum of the temperatures considered is lower, thus leading to a lower maximum temperature, which is now calculated as 50 + 10 * 4 = 90 instead of 50 + 10 * 5 = 100. Finally, it affects the maximum range calculation in the last step, 100 - 50 = 50 becomes 90 - 50 = 40.
