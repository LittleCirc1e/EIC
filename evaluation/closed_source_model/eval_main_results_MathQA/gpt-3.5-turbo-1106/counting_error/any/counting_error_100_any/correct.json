This error transforms the calculation from 18-12 to 18-6, increasing the number of rented out trucks that could have been returned. This counting error affects step 3 by making the number appear as though 24 trucks could be rented out, which is not possible since there are only 18 trucks total.

This affects the calculation of the total number of books sold, the remainder not sold, and the respective percentage. The change from 135 to 120 has modified the subsequent steps without affecting the unrelated steps, resulting in a transformed answer of approximately 70.231% compared to the original answer of 69%.",

        "question": "John had a stock of 620 books in his bookshop. He sold 50 on Monday, 82 on Tuesday, 60 on Wednesday, 48 on Thursday, and 40 on Friday. What percentage of the books were not sold?",

The division by the number of days (which was 5 in reality but mistakenly counted as 4) is not relevant for the calculation of the percentage of books not sold.
