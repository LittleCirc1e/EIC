        "explanation": "Here, step 3 erroneously counts the number of miles Julia ran as equal to the number of miles Bill ran on Sunday instead of twice. This causes step 3 to change from 2(x+4)=2x+8 to 1(x+4)=x+4, a counting error of the miles Julia ran. And it affects the subsequent related steps: step 4 is changed from 4x + 12 = 28 to 3x + 8 = 28, step 5 is changed from 4x = 16 to 3x = 20, step 6 is changed from x = 4 to x = 6.6667, and step 7, the conclusion, is changed from Bill ran 8 miles to Bill ran 10.6667 miles on Sunday. The error is isolated to this multiplication factor, and all other arithmetic steps are correct.",

        "corrected_answer": 10.6667,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution is incorrect because it calculates the value of x as 6.6667, which is not a valid number of miles for Bill to run on Saturday. The correct value of x should be 8, and therefore the correct number of miles Bill ran on Sunday is 12."
