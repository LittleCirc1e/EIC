This incorrect total distance affects the subsequent calculation of average speed, where 60 km is divided by the total time (which remains 2 hours correctly) to produce an average speed of 30 km/h. All other calculations are correct, but the wrongful change of the operator in step 1 leads to a transformed answer that is different from the original.",

        "explanation": "In this example, the addition in the original equation 6t + 3t = 36 was changed to subtraction, making it 6t - 3t = 36. The subtraction led to a new equation, 3t = 36, with t being incorrectly calculated to satisfy the incorrect equation. This results in a wrong time of t=12, which affects the subsequent calculation of Maxwell's distance. The correct calculation of step 5 becomes 3t = 36, giving t = 12, and step 6 then multiplies Maxwell’s speed by this incorrect time to get a final incorrect result of 36 kilometers.
