The mistake in the solution is that it incorrectly calculated the number of mats that one mat-weaver can weave in one day. It stated that one mat-weaver can weave 1/4 of a mat in one day, which is incorrect. The correct calculation is 1 / 4 = 0.25, which means that one mat-weaver can weave 0.25 of a mat in one day. Therefore, 12 mat-weavers can weave 3 mats in one day because 12 x 0.25 = 3. And 12 mat-weavers can weave 36 mats in 12 days because 3 x 12 = 36."
