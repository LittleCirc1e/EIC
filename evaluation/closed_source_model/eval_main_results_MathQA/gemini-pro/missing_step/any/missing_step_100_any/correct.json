Consequently, step 2 should reference the result from the question, which is 50 doughnuts equivalent to 5 parts. The reference to each part being equivalent to 10 still holds as the calculation method is correct, but since we consider there to be 10 parts of muffins instead of 1, step 2 should be modified to reflect a 1:1 part ratio between doughnuts and muffins. Given there are 50 doughnuts, the calculation changes to 50 x 1 = 50 for the number of muffins, which should ultimately modify the formula to 50 x 1 = 50. It should be noted that the calculation in step 3 maintains the error and refers incorrectly to '10 parts of muffins', as the initial step that created the incorrect carryover effect from the deletion is step 1, thus it is marked as the wrong_step. The transformed_solution erroneously states that there are 100 muffins due to incorrectly maintaining the original step 4 calculation without adjusting for the altered quantity suggested by the deleted step 1 (10 parts was used instead of the correct 1 part, leading to multiplying by 10 instead of 1).",
