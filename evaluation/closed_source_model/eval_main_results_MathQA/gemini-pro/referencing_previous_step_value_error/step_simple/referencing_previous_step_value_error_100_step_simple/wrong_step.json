        "question": "a bus started its journey from mumbai and reached pune in 65 min with its average speed of 60 km / hr . if the average speed of the bus is increased by 5 km / hr , how much time will it take to cover the same distance ?",
        "original_solution": "Convert 65 min to hours: 65 / 60 = 1.083 hours\nCalculate the distance: 60 x 1.083 = 65 km\nNew speed is 60 + 5 = 65 km/hr\nTime taken with new speed: 65 / 65 = 1 hour\n#### 1 hour",
        "original_answer": "1 hour",
        "transformed_solution": "Convert 65 min to hours: 65 / 60 = 1.083 hours\nCalculate the distance: 60 x 1.083 = 65 km\nNew speed is 60 + 5 = 65 km/hr\nTime taken with new speed: 70 / 65 = 1.077 hours\n#### 1.077 hours",
        "transformed_answer": "1.077 hours",

        "wrong_type": "referencing_previous_step_value_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references the increased average speed as 70 km/hr from the previous step instead of 65 km/hr and changes 65 / 65 = 1 hour to 70 / 65 = 1.077 hours. It should be noted that step 3 in the transformed_solution <New speed is 60 + 5 = 65 km/hr> should be the same as the step 3 in the original_solution <New speed is 60 + 5 = 65 km/hr> and calculates its result 65 km/hr correctly. The erroneous step 4 results in a miscalculated time taken with the new speed, but since we only consider one step error, all other steps that reference these numbers still reference them correctly. Furthermore, the transformed_answer should be different from the original_answer, which is achieved with the mistake in referencing.",
