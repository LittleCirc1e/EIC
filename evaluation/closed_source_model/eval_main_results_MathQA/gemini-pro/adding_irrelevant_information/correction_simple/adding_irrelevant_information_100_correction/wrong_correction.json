        "corrected_explanation": "The batsman scored 210 runs in total, including 3 boundaries and 8 sixes. Each boundary is worth 4 runs, so he scored 12 runs from boundaries. Each six is worth 6 runs, so he scored 48 runs from sixes. Therefore, he scored 150 runs by running between the wickets. To find the percentage of his total score that he made by running between the wickets, we can divide the number of runs he scored by running between the wickets by his total score and multiply by 100. This gives us (150 / 210) x 100 = 71.43%. Therefore, the batsman made 71.43% of his total score by running between the wickets."
