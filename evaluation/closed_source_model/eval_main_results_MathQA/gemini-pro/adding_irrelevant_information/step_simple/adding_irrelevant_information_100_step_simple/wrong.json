        "explanation": "Step 1 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <and there is a penalty of 2 units for drawing numbers on the board>, resulting in step 1 changing from x = 6a + 3 in the original_solution to x = 6a + 3 - 2 in the transformed_solution. This change affects the calculation of the square of the number and thus the wrong remainder is obtained when divided by 6. It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct.",

        "step_explanation": "The solution is correct. It correctly sets up the equation x = 6a + 3 - 2 to represent the number x, and then squares both sides of the equation to get x^2 = (6a + 1)^2. It then simplifies this expression to get x^2 = 36a^2 + 12a + 1, and finally divides both sides of this equation by 6 to get x^2 / 6 = 6a^2 + 2a + 1/6. This shows that when the square of the number is divided by 6, the remainder is 1."
