        "corrected_answer": 512,
        "corrected_explanation": "The question is to find the number that, when divided by 62976, equals 123. So, we can set up the equation as 62976 รท ? = 123. To solve for ?, we can multiply both sides of the equation by ?, which gives us 62976 = 123 * ?. Then, we can divide both sides of the equation by 123, which gives us ? = 62976 รท 123. Therefore, the answer is 512."

This error affects the equation to be solved and thus, results in a different calculated interest rate in step 4.

        "corrected_explanation": "The percentage decrease in area is the product of the percentage decrease in length and the percentage decrease in breadth. In this case, the percentage decrease in length is 20% and the percentage decrease in breadth is also 20%. So, the percentage decrease in area is 20% x 20% = 4%.
