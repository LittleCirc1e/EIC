Alice leaves city A 30 minutes after Bob. What is the minimum constant speed in miles per hour that Alice must exceed in order to arrive in city B before Bob?",
        "original_solution": "The time it takes Bob to get to city B is 30 miles / 40 miles per hour = 0.75 hours.\nAlice leaves 30 minutes after Bob, so she has 0.5 hours less time to get to city B than Bob.\nTo get to city B before Bob, Alice must drive 30 miles in 0.75 - 0.5 = 0.25 hours.\nTherefore, the minimum constant speed in miles per hour that Alice must exceed in order to arrive in city B before Bob is 30 miles / 0.25 hours = 120 miles per hour.\n#### 120",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 makes an incorrect unit conversion error by stating that Alice has 0.75 hours less time instead of 0.5 hours, due to incorrectly converting 30 minutes into 0.75 hours instead of the correct 0.5 hours. This error affects the subsequent steps, specifically steps 3 and 4, where the time Alice has to drive is calculated incorrectly as 0 hours (0.75 - 0.75), leading to an incorrect, undefined speed calculation since one cannot divide by zero.",

        "explanation": "In the transformed_solution, incorrect unit conversion is applied by changing the time passed after both hourglasses have been flipped to 10 minutes instead of 11. This changes the calculation in step 4, which previously added up to 11 minutes and now incorrectly sums to 10 minutes. As a result, the total time in the final step is now 14 minutes, which is incorrect.

        "question": "Excluding stoppages, the speed of a bus is 54 kmph and including stoppages, it is 36 kmph. For how many minutes does the bus stop per hour?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the time the bus stops per hour.\nAccording to the given information, the distance covered excluding stoppages is the same as that including stoppages. Therefore, the time taken excluding stoppages is less than the time taken including stoppages.\nDistance = speed x time\nThe speed of the bus without stoppages is 54 kmph, and with stoppages is 36 kmph, which means the bus covers 18 km less in an hour when it stops.\nTo find out for how long the bus stops, we calculate the difference in distance traveled: 54 km/h - 36 km/h = 18 km/h difference.\nThis difference of 18 km occurs because the bus is stopping for some time during the hour. To convert this lost distance back into time, we find out the fraction of the hour the bus stoppages take, which is the difference in speed (18 km/h) divided by the original speed (54 km/h).\nThis gives us 18/54 of an hour the bus is stopped. To convert this fraction to minutes, we multiply by 60 minutes/hour.\nThus, the bus stops for (18/54) * 60 minutes per hour = 20 minutes per hour.\n#### 20",
