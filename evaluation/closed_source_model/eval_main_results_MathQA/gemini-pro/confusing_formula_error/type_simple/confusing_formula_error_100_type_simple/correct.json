The question requires that the area of the triangle to be solved be equal to the base multiplied by height divided by 2, rather than the sum of the sides of the triangle, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the triangle, resulting in (3 * 4) / 2 = 6 square units in the original_solution becoming (3 + 4 + 5) = 12 units in the transformed_solution. This does not affect any previous steps because they all correctly calculate the height using the Pythagorean theorem.
