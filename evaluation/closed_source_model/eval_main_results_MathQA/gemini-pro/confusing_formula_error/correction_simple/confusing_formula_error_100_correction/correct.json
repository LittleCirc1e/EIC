The question calculates volume using the formula L*W*D for a normal block and then applies the same approach for a large block with modified dimensions (2W and 2D). However, in the transformed_solution, instead of using the volume formula L*(2W)*(2D), it mistakenly calculates what appears to be the surface area using an incorrect formula 2*(L*W + W*D + D*L). The multiplier \"3\" should not be there, as the correct surface area formula does not require it, and the context of the problem is volume calculation, not surface area. This modifies the correct value of 20 cubic feet to an incorrect transformed_answer of 60 cubic feet. The explanation indicates the mistake of replacing the volume calculation with an incorrect surface area calculation in the context of the problem.",
