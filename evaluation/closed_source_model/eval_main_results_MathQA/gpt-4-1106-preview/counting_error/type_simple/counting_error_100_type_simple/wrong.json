        "question": "Gary’s gas station serves an average of 13 cars per hour on Saturdays, 10 cars per hour on Sundays, and 9 cars per hour on all other days of the week. If the station is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, how many cars does Gary’s station serve over the course of a typical week?",
        "original_solution": "The station is open for 16 hours on Saturday and Sunday, and 16 * 5 = 80 hours on all other days\nOn Saturday, the station serves 13 * 16 = 208 cars\nOn Sunday, the station serves 10 * 16 = 160 cars\nOn all other days, the station serves 9 * 80 = 720 cars\nThe total number of cars served in a typical week is 208 + 160 + 720 = 1088 cars\n#### 1088",
        "original_answer": 1088,
        "transformed_solution": "The station is open for 16 hours on Saturday and 16 hours on Sunday, and 16 * 6 = 96 hours on all other days\nOn Saturday, the station serves 13 * 16 = 208 cars\nOn Sunday, the station serves 10 * 16 = 160 cars\nOn all other days, the station serves 9 * 96 = 864 cars\nThe total number of cars served in a typical week is 208 + 160 + 864 = 1232 cars\n#### 1232",

        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 mistakenly counts the number of hours the station is open from Monday to Friday as 16 * 6 = 96 hours instead of 16 * 5 = 80 hours. This counting error also affects step 3, changing the calculation from 9 * 80 = 720 cars to 9 * 96 = 864 cars, and affects step 4, changing the total from 1088 cars to 1232 cars. The other calculation processes are still correct.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_type": "none",
        "type_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the number of hours the station is open each day and multiplies it by the average number of cars served per hour for each day of the week. The final summation of cars served across the week is also correct, leading to the correct total."

        "question": "John had a stock of 1400 books in his bookshop. He sold 75 on Monday, 50 on Tuesday, 64 on Wednesday, 78 on Thursday, and 135 on Friday. What percentage of the books were not sold?",
        "original_solution": "Total books sold from Monday to Friday is 75 + 50 + 64 + 78 + 135 = 402 books\nThe remaining books after these sales is 1400 - 402 = 998 books\nThe percentage of the books not sold is (998 / 1400) * 100 = 71.2857%\nThe percentage of the books not sold is approximately 71.29%\n#### 71.29",
        "original_answer": 71.29,
        "transformed_solution": "Total books sold from Monday to Friday is 75 + 50 + 64 + 78 + 135 = 402 books\nThe remaining books after these sales is 1400 - 402 = 998 books\nThe percentage of the books not sold is (998 / 1400) * 100 = 71.2857%\nThe percentage of the books not sold is approximately 71%\n#### 71",

        "wrong_step": 4,
        "wrong_type": "rounding_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, the final step inaccurately rounds the percentage from 71.2857% to 71% instead of the correct 71.29% as per the original solution. This causes the transformed answer to be different from the original answer, creating a rounding error at step 4. It's important to note that the counting in earlier steps is unchanged, with only the final rounding step being affected.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_type": "none",
        "type_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the total number of books sold, subtracts this from the initial stock to find the remaining books, and then correctly calculates the percentage of books not sold. The arithmetic and the application of the percentage formula are correct."

        "question": "At Chennai it rained as much on Tuesday as on all the others days of the week combined. If the average rainfall for the whole week was 3cm. How much did it rain on Tuesday?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the amount of rain on Tuesday\nTotal rainfall for the week = 7 * 3 = 21 cm\nTotal rainfall for Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday = 21 - x\nSince it rained as much on Tuesday as on all the others days combined: x = 21 - x\n2x = 21\nx = 10.5\n#### 10.5",
        "original_answer": 10.5,
        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the amount of rain on Tuesday\nTotal rainfall for the week = 6 * 3 = 18 cm\nTotal rainfall for Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday = 18 - x\nSince it rained as much on Tuesday as on all the others days combined: x = 18 - x\n2x = 18\nx = 9\n#### 9",

        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In step 2 of the original_solution, the total days are erroneously counted as 6 instead of 7 when calculating the total rainfall for the week. This affects the following steps since the total rainfall is now incorrectly set to 18 cm instead of 21 cm. Consequently, the calculation is based on the wrong total, which also changes the final answer for Tuesday’s rainfall from 10.5 cm to 9 cm.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_type": "none",
        "type_explanation": "The solution correctly sets up an equation where x represents the rainfall on Tuesday and correctly calculates the total weekly rainfall based on the average. The equation x = 18 - x is properly derived from the given information that Tuesday's rainfall equals the sum of the rainfall for the other days. Solving this equation correctly yields the result that it rained 9 cm on Tuesday."
