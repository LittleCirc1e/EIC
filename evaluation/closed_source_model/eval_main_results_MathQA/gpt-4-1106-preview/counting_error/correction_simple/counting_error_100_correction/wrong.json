        "question": "how many positive integers less than 60 have a reminder 01 when divided by 4 ?",
        "original_solution": "The numbers that satisfy this condition are the ones that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, so the numbers are 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57.\nThere are 15 numbers that satisfy this condition.\n#### 15",
        "original_answer": 15,
        "transformed_solution": "The numbers that satisfy this condition are the ones that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, so the numbers are 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53.\nThere are 14 numbers that satisfy this condition.\n#### 14",

        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In the transformed_solution, the counting result has been erroneously altered by excluding the number 57, which should have been included as it is less than 60 and leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. Therefore, the count of numbers has changed from 15 to 14, which only impacts the final count of numbers that meet the condition and does not affect the previous steps of listing the numbers.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "corrected_solution": "none",
        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly lists all positive integers less than 60 that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. The count of such numbers is indeed 14, which matches the solution provided."

        "question": "At Chennai it rained as much on Tuesday as on all the others days of the week combined. If the average rainfall for the whole week was 3cm. How much did it rain on Tuesday?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the amount of rain on Tuesday\nTotal rainfall for the week = 7 * 3 = 21 cm\nTotal rainfall for Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday = 21 - x\nSince it rained as much on Tuesday as on all the others days combined: x = 21 - x\n2x = 21\nx = 10.5\n#### 10.5",
        "original_answer": 10.5,
        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the amount of rain on Tuesday\nTotal rainfall for the week = 6 * 3 = 18 cm\nTotal rainfall for Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday = 18 - x\nSince it rained as much on Tuesday as on all the others days combined: x = 18 - x\n2x = 18\nx = 9\n#### 9",

        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In step 2 of the original_solution, the total days are erroneously counted as 6 instead of 7 when calculating the total rainfall for the week. This affects the following steps since the total rainfall is now incorrectly set to 18 cm instead of 21 cm. Consequently, the calculation is based on the wrong total, which also changes the final answer for Tuesday’s rainfall from 10.5 cm to 9 cm.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "corrected_solution": "none",
        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly sets up an equation where x represents the rainfall on Tuesday, and the total rainfall for the week is calculated as 7 days times the average of 3 cm, which equals 21 cm, not 18 cm as stated in the solution. However, the mistake in the total rainfall does not affect the final answer because the equation x = 18 - x correctly represents the given condition that Tuesday's rainfall is equal to the sum of the other days. Solving this equation gives x = 9 cm, which is the correct amount of rainfall on Tuesday."
