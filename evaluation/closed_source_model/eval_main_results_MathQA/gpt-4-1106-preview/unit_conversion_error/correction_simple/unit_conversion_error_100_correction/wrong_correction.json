        "corrected_answer": 6.67,
        "corrected_explanation": "The correct calculation for the time the train stops is found by setting the distance without stoppages equal to the distance with stoppages. Since the train travels the same distance in both scenarios, we have 400 * 1 = 360 * (1 - x). Solving for x gives us the proportion of an hour that the train stops. Multiplying this by 60 gives us the time in minutes. The correct calculation is (1/9) * 60, which is approximately 6.67 minutes, not 5 minutes as stated in the original solution."

        "question": "A leak in the bottom of a tank can empty the full tank in 6 hours. An inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute. When the tank is full, the inlet is opened and due to the leak, the tank is empty in 12 hours. How many litres does the cistern hold?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the capacity of the tank in litres.\nThe inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute, so in 12 hours it fills 6 * 12 * 60 = 4320 litres.\nThe leak can empty the tank in 6 hours, so in 12 hours it can empty 2x litres.\nNow, 4320 - 2x = x.

In 12 hours, it would empty 12 * (x/6) = 2x litres.\nNow, the amount of water filled by the inlet in 12 hours minus the amount of water emptied by the leak in 12 hours should be equal to 0, since the tank is empty after 12 hours.\nSo, 4320 - 2x = 0.

        "corrected_answer": 2160.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The inlet pipe fills at a rate of 6 litres per minute, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 12 hours it would fill 6 * 12 * 60 litres, not 6 * 12 * 50. The correct calculation for the inlet is 6 * 12 * 60 = 4320 litres. The leak empties the tank at a rate that would empty the full tank in 6 hours, so in 12 hours, it would empty twice the capacity of the tank (2x litres). Setting the equation 4320 - 2x = 0 and solving for x gives the correct capacity of the tank, which is 2160 litres."
