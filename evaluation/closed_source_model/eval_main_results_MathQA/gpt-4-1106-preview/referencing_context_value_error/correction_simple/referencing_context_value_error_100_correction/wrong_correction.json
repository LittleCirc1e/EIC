The percentage error is calculated by dividing the absolute error by the actual value and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage."

The number of students who took the make-up exam is the remainder, which is 27 students, not 36. The total score for each group is calculated by multiplying the number of students by their average score as a percentage. The total score for the entire class is the sum of these two totals. Finally, the average score for the entire class is the total score divided by the number of students, which gives 63%, not 64%."
