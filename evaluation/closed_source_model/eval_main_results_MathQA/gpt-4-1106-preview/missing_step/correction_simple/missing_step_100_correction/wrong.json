        "explanation": "This example removes intermediate step 2 that calculates the remaining income after spending on petrol. In the original_solution, step 3 references the result of step 2, and steps 4 and 5 reference the result of step 3. Therefore, after deleting step 2, step 3 should reference the Rs. 300 spent on petrol from the question and change the calculated method for the remaining income to the inverse of petrol's percentage, which is 300 / 0.3 = 1000. Step 4 and 5, as subsequent related steps, are affected by the modification in step 3. In the transformed_solution, step 4 (previously step 5 in original_solution) now calculates the incorrect house rent expenditure by directly using the total income (1000) instead of the remaining income after spending on petrol, and step 5 calculates the balance on food. The first wrong step referencing an incorrect number in the transformed_solution is step 3, as it should reference the remaining income after petrol, not the full income.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "corrected_solution": "none",
        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the total income by dividing the expenditure on petrol by the percentage of income spent on petrol. It then correctly calculates the expenditure on house rent by taking 30% of the remaining income. The final answer for the expenditure on house rent is correctly given as Rs. 300."
