        "explanation": "Here, step 1 has been removed, which calculates the total parts of the ratio. Consequently, step 2 should reference the result from the question, which is 50 doughnuts equivalent to 5 parts. The reference to each part being equivalent to 10 still holds as the calculation method is correct, but since we consider there to be 10 parts of muffins instead of 1, step 2 should be modified to reflect a 1:1 part ratio between doughnuts and muffins. Given there are 50 doughnuts, the calculation changes to 50 x 1 = 50 for the number of muffins, which should ultimately modify the formula to 50 x 1 = 50. It should be noted that the calculation in step 3 maintains the error and refers incorrectly to '10 parts of muffins', as the initial step that created the incorrect carryover effect from the deletion is step 1, thus it is marked as the wrong_step. The transformed_solution erroneously states that there are 100 muffins due to incorrectly maintaining the original step 4 calculation without adjusting for the altered quantity suggested by the deleted step 1 (10 parts was used instead of the correct 1 part, leading to multiplying by 10 instead of 1).",

The correct equation is derived from the fact that the initial 2 bananas per child would have been 2x in total, and after the distribution with the absent children, it became 2x + 2 * 390.

Instead of calculating the correct subtraction of the sums (160 - 70), the transformed solution uses the incorrect subtraction (160 - 70 x 2).

To get c - a, we need to subtract a from c, so the correct calculation is (160 - b) - a = c - a.

However, this calculation actually gives us 2b. The correct approach is to recognize that the sum of b and c minus the sum of a and b gives us c - a, but since we only have the average values, we need to use the fact that the sum of b and c is 160 and the sum of a and b is 70.

By removing the speed equation step, subsequent steps should rely on the given information. Step 4 became the initial step and affected all following steps. In the transformed solution, the original steps 3 and 4 to find the train's speed over the two platforms are consolidated by taking the second platform's equation as a reference. The original step 5's equation simplifies the relationship between the two speeds, which in the transformed solution becomes step 2. Step 3 eliminates the denominator from both sides (2x + 640 = x + 250), leading to step 4 (2x + 1280 = x + 250). Finally, step 5 solves for 'x', which is determined to be 1030 meters, not 140.

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 has been removed, which calculated Shekhar's current age, and is also the step that provides the base age for calculating Shobha's age. The modified solution skips the calculation of Shekhar's current age and refers directly to his age after 6 years, which is 26. Since step 1 references a number from the question (Shekhar's age after 6 years), the subsequent step that references the result of step 1 now refers back to the age of Shekhar after 6 years instead. As the next step originally multiplied Shekhar's current age by (3/4) to get Shobha's current age, the transformation led to 26 * (3/4), the largest number provided by the context of the original step 1. This is an error because the age after 6 years was used instead of the current age, giving an inflated number for Shobha's age. It is the first step in the transformed_solution, which references the incorrect number (26 years after 6 years), so the wrong_step is 1.",

Step 1 of the original_solution originally involved adding the individual percentages of length and breadth reduction and also including the combined effect of the reductions. However, after deletion, the transformed_solution incorrectly only takes the product of the two percentage reductions (20% x 20%), which actually represents the combined effect, not the entire decrease in area. The combined effect has been mistaken for the total decrease in area, resulting in a calculation that only considers the intersection of the length and breadth reductions. The transformed_solution, therefore, does not add the individual percentage reductions of length and breadth, hence arriving at an incorrect answer of 4%.

The new area is then (0.8 * L) * (0.8 * B) = 0.64 * (L * B). The decrease in area is 1 - 0.64 = 0.36 or 36%.",
