        "explanation": "Step 1 references 54 km/hr in the question as 50 km/hr wrongly, and calculates 50 x 1000 / 3600 = 13.89 m/s instead of 54 x 1000 / 3600 = 15 m/s. Its subsequent related step will be affected, calculating the time as 500 m / 13.89 m/s = 36.01 seconds instead of 500 m / 15 m/s = 33.33 seconds in step 3. Please note that you should only consider one error, so step 2 still references 360 m and 140 m in the question correctly.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "First, we need to convert the speed from km/hr to m/s. 54 km/hr = 54 x 1000 / 3600 = 15 m/s.\nNext, we need to calculate the total distance the train needs to cover, which is 360 m + 140 m = 500 m.\nNow, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time it takes for the train to pass the bridge. Time = 500 m / 15 m/s = 33.33 seconds.",
        "corrected_answer": "33.33",
        "corrected_explanation": "The original solution incorrectly calculated the speed of the train in m/s and also had a calculation error in the final time. The correct speed is 15 m/s, not 13.89 m/s, which results in a time of 33.33 seconds to cross the 500-meter distance."
