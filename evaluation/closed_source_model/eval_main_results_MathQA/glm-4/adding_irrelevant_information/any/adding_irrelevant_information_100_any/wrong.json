        "question": "A cistern can be filled by a tap in 3 hours while it can be emptied by another tap in 8 hours. If both the taps are opened simultaneously, then after how much time will the cistern get filled?",
        "original_solution": "The combined rate of both taps is 1/3 - 1/8 = 5/24 cistern/hour\nIt will take 24/5 = 4.8 hours to fill the cistern\n#### 4.8",
        "original_answer": 4.8,
        "transformed_solution": "The combined rate of both taps is 1/3 - 1/8 = 5/24 cistern/hour\nAssuming there is a leak that causes water to be lost at a rate of 1/24 cistern/hour, the corrected combined rate is 5/24 - 1/24 = 4/24 or 1/6 cistern/hour\nIt will take 6/1 = 6 hours to fill the cistern\n#### 6",

        "wrong_type": "adding_irrelevant_information",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 2 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <Assuming there is a leak that causes water to be lost at a rate of 1/24 cistern/hour>, resulting in step 2 changing from the combined rate of 5/24 cistern/hour to 4/24 or 1/6 cistern/hour in the transformed_solution. The final result of the transformed solution is 6 hours to fill the cistern, different from the original answer of 4.8 hours. It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the combined rate of the taps as the difference between their filling and emptying rates, which is 5/24 cistern/hour. It then accounts for a leak that reduces the effective filling rate to 4/24 or 1/6 cistern/hour. The time taken to fill the cistern is correctly calculated as the reciprocal of the effective rate, which is 6 hours."
