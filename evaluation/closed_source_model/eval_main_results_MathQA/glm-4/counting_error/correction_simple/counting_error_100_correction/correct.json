We know that the total number of cups is 16 and that Mo drank 4 more tea cups than hot chocolate cups. So we have the equations: n * r + 2 * (7 - r) = 16 and 2 * (7 - r) = n * r + 4. Substituting the second equation into the first, we get 2 * (7 - r) = n * r + 4, which simplifies to 14 - 2r = nr + 4.

        "corrected_answer": "2.0",
        "corrected_explanation": "From the corrected solution, we have the equation 10 = (n + 2)r. We know that n is the number of hot chocolate cups on a rainy day, which is an integer, and the total number of cups is 16, with 4 more tea cups than hot chocolate cups. Therefore, n + 4 = the number of tea cups, and since the total number of cups is 16, we have n + n + 4 = 16, which simplifies to 2n + 4 = 16, and then 2n = 12, so n = 6. Substituting n = 6 into the equation 10 = (n + 2)r, we get 10 = (6 + 2)r, which simplifies to 10 = 8r, and thus r = 10 / 8 = 1.25. However, r must be an integer because it represents the number of days, so we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's re-evaluate: if we have 4 more tea cups than hot chocolate cups and a total of 16 cups, we cannot have 6 hot chocolate cups, because 6 tea cups would only make 12 cups in total. We must have meant that if n is the number of hot chocolate cups on a rainy day, then 2 * (7 - r) = n * r + 4, and since we know that 2 * (7 - r) is the number of tea cups, we can solve for r with the knowledge that the total number of cups is 16. Therefore, 2 * (7 - r) + n * r = 16 and 2 * (7 - r) = n * r + 4. Substituting the second equation into the first, we get n * r + 4 + n * r = 16, which simplifies to 2n * r + 4 = 16, and then 2n * r = 12. Since we know that there are 4 more tea cups than hot chocolate cups, n = 2, and so 2 * 2 * r = 12, which simplifies to 4r = 12, and thus r = 3. Therefore, there were 3 rainy days last week."

        "question": "Sheila works 8 hours per day on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and 6 hours per day on Tuesday and Thursday. She does not work on Saturday and Sunday. She earns $ 396 per week. How much does she earn in dollars per hour?",
        "original_solution": "The total hours worked from Monday through Friday is 8 + 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 36 hours\nThe total number of days from Monday through Friday is 5 days\nThe average number of hours Sheila works per day is 36 / 5 = 7.2 hours\nShe earns $396 per week\nSo, she earns $396 / 36 hours = $11 per hour\n#### 11",
        "original_answer": 11.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total hours worked from Monday through Friday is 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 hours\nThe total number of days from Monday through Friday is 4 days\nThe average number of hours Sheila works per day is 28 / 4 = 7 hours\nShe earns $396 per week\nSo, she earns $396 / 28 hours = $14.14 per hour\n#### 14.14",
        "transformed_answer": 14.14,

        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 erroneously counts the number of workdays as 4 instead of 5, excluding one of the 8-hour workdays. This alteration changes the total hours worked in the week from 36 to 28, leading to an incorrect calculation of the hourly wage in the later step, which changes from $396 / 36 hours = $11 per hour to $396 / 28 hours = $14.14 per hour. It should be noted that only the first step contains a counting error, and subsequent calculations are based on this mistake; however, these calculations are performed correctly based on the altered inputs.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "The total hours worked from Monday through Friday is 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 + 8 = 36 hours. The total number of days from Monday through Friday is 5 days. The average number of hours Sheila works per day is 36 / 5 = 7.2 hours. She earns $396 per week. So, she earns $396 / 36 hours = $11 per hour",
        "corrected_answer": "11.00",
        "corrected_explanation": "The initial solution did not account for the hours Sheila works on the fifth day of the week, which is also 8 hours. Therefore, the total hours worked per week should be 36, not 28. Dividing the total weekly earnings by the correct number of hours gives the correct hourly rate of $11.00."
