So the highest temperature would be 60 * 4 = 240. However, this would make the lowest temperature the range itself, which is not possible since we already have a temperature of 50. Therefore, the highest temperature possible to still include the lowest temperature of 50 is 300 - 50 = 250, but since we have 5 temperatures, the maximum range would be this highest temperature minus the lowest temperature, 250 - 50 = 200. But this is not the range we're looking for. We need to subtract the sum of the other 4 temperatures from the total sum, which is 300 - 50 = 250, and then subtract the average temperature 60 from this number to get the highest temperature that includes the lowest temperature, that is 250 - 60*4 = 250 - 240 = 10.

        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "There are a total of 366 days in a leap year. With 7 days in a week, there are 52 complete weeks which give 52 Mondays. The extra 2 days in a leap year can be any combination of the 7 days of the week. To have 53 Mondays, the extra days must both be Mondays, which is a probability of 1/49.",
        "corrected_answer": "1/49",
        "corrected_explanation": "In a leap year, there are 52 weeks which give 52 Mondays automatically. The probability of having 53 Mondays depends on the 2 extra days, which can be any of the 7 days of the week. Since there are 49 possible combinations of the 2 extra days (7 choices for the first day times 7 choices for the second day), and only 1 of those combinations results in 2 Mondays, the probability is 1 out of those 49 combinations."

However, we need to calculate this based on the actual number of Sundays in the 30-day period, which could be 4 or 5. Since the month starts with a Sunday, if there are 30 days, there will be 4 full weeks and an extra 2 days which could be a Sunday and a Monday or a Saturday and a Sunday. In this case, let's assume the month has 4 Sundays. The total number of visitors on other days in the month is 240 * (30 - 4) = 6240. The total number of visitors in the month is 2040 + 6240 = 8280. The average number of visitors per day in the month is 8280 / 30 = 276. However, this does not account for the possibility of a 5th Sunday.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The initial calculation did not account for the possibility of a 5th Sunday, which could occur if the month starts with a Sunday and has 30 days. Since the question does not specify the exact distribution of days, we assume the best case scenario with 4 Sundays. The calculation should have considered this, and the average should have been presented as a possibility, not a definitive number, since it could be higher if there is a 5th Sunday."

If the station is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, how many cars does Gary's station serve over the course of a typical week?",

So, the total number of cars served on Saturdays is 16 * 12 = 192 cars\nOn Sundays, the station is open for (10-6) + (22-10) = 16 hours. So, the total number of cars served on Sundays is 16 * 10 = 160 cars\nOn the other days, the station is open for (10-6) + (22-10) = 16 hours each. So, the total number of cars served on other days is 16 * 9 * 5 = 720 cars\nSo, the total number of cars served in a week is 192 + 160 + 720 = 1072 cars\n#### 1072",

We need to find the number of trucks rented out such that when 50% are returned, we have at least 14 left on Saturday morning. The correct calculation is: x - 0.5x = 26 - 14, which simplifies to 0.5x = 12, and then x = 24.
