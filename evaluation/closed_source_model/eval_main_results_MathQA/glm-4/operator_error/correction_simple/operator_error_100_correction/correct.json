Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the height is the perpendicular distance from one of the non-parallel sides to the opposite base. To find h, we can draw a perpendicular from the vertex of the isosceles trapezoid to the middle of the longer base, creating a right triangle. The length of the perpendicular (h) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The base of this right triangle is half the difference between the lengths of the two bases, so it is (12 - 6) / 2 = 3. The hypotenuse of the right triangle is the side length of the trapezoid, which is 5. Therefore, h = sqrt(5^2 - 3^2) = sqrt(25 - 9) = sqrt(16) = 4.

        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "There are 160 / 2 = 80 girls in the class.\nSo, there are 160 - 80 = 80 boys in the class.",
        "corrected_answer": "80",
        "corrected_explanation": "The original solution incorrectly divided by 1/2, which is effectively multiplying by 2. The correct approach is to divide the total number of students by 2 to find the number of girls, and then subtract that from the total to find the number of boys."
