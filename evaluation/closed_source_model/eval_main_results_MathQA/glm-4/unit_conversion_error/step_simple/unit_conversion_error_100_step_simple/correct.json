        "original_solution": "The relative speed of the two projectiles is 470 km/h + 500 km/h = 970 km/h.\nThe time it will take for them to meet is 1455 km / 970 km/h = 1.5 hours.\nSince 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, then 1.5 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 90 minutes.\n#### 90",

And it affects the subsequent related step 3, which changes from 90 minutes to 75 minutes.
