        "question": "A leak in the bottom of a tank can empty the full tank in 6 hours. An inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute. When the tank is full, the inlet is opened and due to the leak, the tank is empty in 12 hours. How many litres does the cistern hold?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the capacity of the tank in litres.\nThe inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute, so in 12 hours it fills 6 * 12 * 60 = 4320 litres.\nThe leak can empty the tank in 6 hours, so in 12 hours it can empty 2x litres.\nNow, 4320 - 2x = x. Solving for x, we get x = 4320.\n#### 4320",
        "original_answer": 4320.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the capacity of the tank in litres.\nThe inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute, so in 12 hours it fills 6 * 12 * 50 = 3600 litres.\nThe leak can empty the tank in 6 hours, so in 12 hours it can empty 2x litres.\nNow, 3600 - 2x = x. Solving for x, we get x = 3600 / 3 = 1200.\n#### 1200",
        "transformed_answer": 1200.0,
        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means that 1 hour wrongly has 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes, resulting in 6 * 12 * 60 = 4320 litres in the original_solution becoming 6 * 12 * 50 = 3600 litres in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 4, which changes from 4320 - 2x = x to 3600 - 2x = x and the solution from x = 4320 to x = 3600 / 3 = 1200 litres for the capacity of the tank. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, so the other calculation processes related to the rate of the leak are still correct.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Let x be the capacity of the tank in litres. The inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute, so in 12 hours it fills 6 * 60 * 12 = 4320 litres. The leak can empty the tank in 6 hours, so in 12 hours, it empties x/6 * 2 = x/3 litres. Now, the net amount of water that remains is 4320 - x/3 = x. Solving for x, we get 4320 = x + x/3, which simplifies to 4320 = 4x/3. Therefore, x = 4320 * 3 / 4 = 3240.",
        "corrected_answer": "3240.0",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly calculated the amount of water filled by the inlet pipe in 12 hours by using 50 as a multiplication factor instead of the correct 60 minutes per hour. Additionally, the leak's rate was incorrectly applied by stating that it can empty 2x litres in 12 hours, while it should be x/3 litres. The corrected solution reflects the accurate calculation of the water filled by the inlet pipe and the correct rate at which the leak empties the tank."
