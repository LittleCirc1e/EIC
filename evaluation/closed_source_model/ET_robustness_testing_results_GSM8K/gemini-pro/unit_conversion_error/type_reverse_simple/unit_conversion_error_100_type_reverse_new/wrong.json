And it affects the subsequent related calculations in steps 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Each instance of '12 inches = 1 foot' in the original solution is now '10 inches = 1 foot' and each subsequent calculation involving inches has been adjusted accordingly. Step 2 changes from 6+8 = 14 inches to 5+8 = 13 inches. Step 3 from 14-2 = 12 inches to 13-2 = 11 inches. Step 4 from 2*6 = 12 inches to 2*5 = 10 inches. And finally step 6 from 24/12 = 2 feet to 21/10 = 2.1 feet. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error for the snowfall received on the first day, and the other calculation processes are still correct even though they are mathematically adjusted for this initial error.",

Step 2 changes from Kagiyami lifting 4*1=4 feet in the original_solution to 4*2=8 feet in the transformed_solution. Similarly, step 3 changes from Naruto lifting a mountain 10*4=40 feet to 10*8=80 feet. It should be noted that only the unit conversion error is made, without affecting the previous steps and the multiplication process itself, only the value used has changed due to the conversion error.",

        "question": "Luke is planning a trip to London and wants to see how long it will take him to travel there. He decides that he will take a bus to the town center, walk for 15 minutes to the train center, wait twice this long for the train to arrive, and then take the 6-hour train ride to London. If Luke’s entire trip takes him 8 hours, how many minutes does his bus ride take?",
        "original_solution": "Removing the time of the train ride from the journey shows that his trip to get on the train took him 8 hours – 6 hours = 2 hours.\nConverting this time into minutes shows that getting to the train took 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.\nWaiting for the train to arrive took twice as long as his walk, so 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes.\nThis means that his bus ride must have taken 120 minutes – 30 minutes - 15 minutes = 75 minutes.\n#### 75",
        "original_answer": 75.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Removing the time of the train ride from the journey shows that his trip to get on the train took him 8 hours – 6 hours = 2 hours.\nConverting this time into minutes shows that getting to the train took 2 hours * 50 minutes/hour = 100 minutes.\nWaiting for the train to arrive took twice as long as his walk, so 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes.\nThis means that his bus ride must have taken 100 minutes – 30 minutes - 15 minutes = 55 minutes.\n#### 55",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In step 2 of the original_solution, an incorrect unit conversion was introduced by changing the number of minutes in an hour from 60 to 50. Therefore, the original 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes is transformed to 2 hours * 50 minutes/hour = 100 minutes. This affected the subsequent related step 4, changing 120 minutes – 30 minutes - 15 minutes = 75 minutes to the incorrect 100 minutes – 30 minutes - 15 minutes = 55 minutes. The transformed_answer is calculated based on this incorrect unit conversion, giving a result of 55 minutes for the bus ride instead of the correct 75 minutes.",
