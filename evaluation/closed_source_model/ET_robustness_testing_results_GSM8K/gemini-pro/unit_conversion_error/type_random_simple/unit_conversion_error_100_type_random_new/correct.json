        "original_solution": "First, we need to determine the total amount of minutes available for cooking. We do this by performing 2*60=120, as there are 60 minutes in an hour.\nNow that we know we have 120 minutes, we then divide the preparation time into the total amount of time by performing 120/20= 6 dishes capable of being made.\nSince each dish can feed 5 people, we find the total number of people fed by performing 5*6=30 people.\n#### 30",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 introduces the unit conversion error, where 1 hour is incorrectly assumed to have 50 minutes instead of the correct 60 minutes. This change in the unit conversion misleads the solution from 2*60=120 to 2*50=100. Consequently, this wrong conversion step reduces the total cooking time available from 120 minutes in the original solution to 100 minutes in the transformed solution and impacts the number of dishes that can be made. Following this, the number of dishes is recalculated to be 5 instead of 6, and as a result, the total number of people who can be fed is decreased from 30 to 25.",
