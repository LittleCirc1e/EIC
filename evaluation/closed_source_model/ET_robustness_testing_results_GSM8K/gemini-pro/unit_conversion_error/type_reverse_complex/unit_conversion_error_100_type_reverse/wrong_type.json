        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 hour is wrongly assumed to have 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes, resulting in 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes in the original_solution becoming 2 hours * 50 minutes/hour = 100 minutes in the transformed_solution. This error affects the subsequent related step, which changes from 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 130 minutes to 100 minutes + 10 minutes = 110 minutes. Subsequently, the equation used to solve for the time spent looking at the seals changes from s + 8s + 13 = 130 to s + 8s + 13 = 110, and the final value of s changes from s = 13 to s ≈ 10.78. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, and the other calculation processes, including the equation setup and algebraic steps, are still correct.",
