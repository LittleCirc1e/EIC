This error affects the subsequent related step, which changes from 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 130 minutes to 100 minutes + 10 minutes = 110 minutes. Subsequently, the equation used to solve for the time spent looking at the seals changes from s + 8s + 13 = 130 to s + 8s + 13 = 110, and the final value of s changes from s = 13 to s â‰ˆ 10.78.
