And it affects the subsequent related step 3, which changes from 3,000 minutes she needs to drive / 40 minutes driving each day = 75 school days to 2,500 minutes she needs to drive / 40 minutes driving each day = 62.5 school days.

This results in a cascade of errors through the subsequent steps. The original_solution stating that a bunny will come out of the hole 60*3=180 times is transformed to 50*3=150 times.

This error impacts step 4, changing the calculation of the number of four-minute songs needed from 12 / 4 = 3 to 2 / 4 = 0.5.
