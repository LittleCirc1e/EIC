        "question": "Nancy, the librarian, is shelving books from the cart. She shelved 12 history books, 8 romance books, and 4 poetry books from the top section of the cart. Half the books on the bottom section of the cart were mystery books, which she quickly put back into place. Then, she shelved the remaining books from the bottom of the cart, including 5 Western novels and 6 biographies. How many books did she have on the book cart when she started?",
        "original_solution": "Half of the books on the bottom section of the cart are mystery books, which means they are the same as the number of Western novels and biographies put together. So there are 5 + 6 = 11 mystery novels.\nAdd them all together, and there are 12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 11 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies = 46 books total\n#### 46",
        "original_answer": 46.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Half of the books on the bottom section of the cart are mystery books, which means they are the same number as the sum of Western novels, biographies, and an additional 3 literature textbooks that Nancy forgot to count initially. So there are 5 Western novels + 6 biographies + 3 literature textbooks = 14 books that are not mystery novels.\nThe mystery books are the same amount, so there are also 14 mystery novels.\nTo find the total, we sum up all the categories: 12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 14 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies + 3 literature = 52 books total\n#### 52",

        "wrong_type": "adding_irrelevant_information",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The modified step 1 adds information that is not mentioned in the original question statement <and an additional 3 literature textbooks that Nancy forgot to count initially>, resulting in the transformation of the step from \"5 + 6 = 11 mystery novels\" in the original_solution to \"5 Western novels + 6 biographies + 3 literature textbooks = 14 books that are not mystery novels\" in the transformed_solution. This affects the following summation step, changing the total from \"12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 11 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies = 46 books\" to \"12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 14 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies + 3 literature = 52 books\". The other calculation processes remain correct.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_type": "none",
        "type_explanation": "The solution is correct because it correctly identifies the number of mystery books as half of the books on the bottom section of the cart, and then correctly adds up all the categories to find the total number of books."

        "question": "Linda is painting her bedroom. Her bedroom has 4 walls, with the room being 20 feet wide by 20 feet long by 8 feet tall. One wall has a 3-foot by 7-foot doorway. A second wall has a 6-foot by 4-foot window. A third wall has a 5-foot by 7-foot doorway to a walk-in-closet. And the fourth wall is completely solid. What is the total area of wall space that Linda will have to paint?",
        "original_solution": "The solid wall is 8 ft. * 20 ft. = 160 sq. ft.\nThe doorway is 3 ft. * 7 ft. = 21 sq. ft.\nThe window is 6 ft. * 4 ft. = 24 sq. ft.\nThe closet door is 5 ft. * 7 ft. = 35 sq. ft.\nThe total area of the doors and windows is 21 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 80 sq. ft.\nThe solid wall is 160 sq. ft., so before the areas of the doors and window are taken into account, the total wall area is 4 * 160 sq. ft. = 640 sq. ft.\nTaking into account the doors and window, the total wall area Linda will have to paint is 640 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 560 sq. ft.\n#### 560",
        "original_answer": 560.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The solid wall is 8 ft. * 20 ft. = 160 sq. ft.\nThe doorway is 3 ft. * 7 ft. = 21 sq. ft.\nThe window is 6 ft. * 4 ft. = 24 sq. ft.\nThe closet door is 5 ft. * 7 ft. = 35 sq. ft.\nBecause there is also a 2-foot by 2-foot painting on the second wall that does not need painting, the total area of the doors, windows, and the painting is 21 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. + 4 sq. ft. = 84 sq. ft.\nThe solid wall is 160 sq. ft., so before the areas of the doors, window, and painting are taken into account, the total wall area is 4 * 160 sq. ft. = 640 sq. ft.\nTaking into account the doors, window, and the painting, the total wall area Linda will have to paint is 640 sq. ft. - 84 sq. ft. = 556 sq. ft.\n#### 556",

This additional irrelevant detail modifies the total wall area to be painted from 560 sq. ft. in the original solution to 556 sq. ft. in the transformed solution.

        "type_explanation": "The solution is correct. It correctly calculates the area of the solid wall, the doorway, the window, the closet door, and the painting, and then subtracts the total area of the doors, window, and painting from the total wall area to get the total area of wall space that Linda will have to paint."
