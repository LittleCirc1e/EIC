        "transformed_solution": "The vans held 9 vans * 8 people = 72 people.\nThe buses held 10 buses * 27 people = 270 people.\nBecause there were an additional 2 teachers per bus for supervision, the buses total had 10 buses * 2 teachers = 20 teachers.\nThe total number of people on the field trip is 72 + 270 + 20 = 362 people.\n#### 362",
