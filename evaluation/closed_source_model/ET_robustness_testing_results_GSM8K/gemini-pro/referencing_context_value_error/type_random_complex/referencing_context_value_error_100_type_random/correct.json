        "original_solution": "Susan works 2 * 5 = 10 days in two weeks.\nShe is taking 10 - 6 = 4 days of unpaid vacation.\nAt $15 per hour, she is paid 15 * 8 = $120 per day.\nAt $120 per day, Susan will miss 120 * 4 = $480 on her vacation.\n#### 480",

        "explanation": "Step 3 references $15 in the question as $20 wrongly, and calculates 20 * 8 = $160 per day instead of 15 * 8 = $120 per day. The subsequent related step, step 4, inherits this error and will be affected accordingly, calculating 160 * 4 = $640 instead of 120 * 4 = $480. All other steps that reference this number should still reference this number correctly except for the step referenced incorrectly.",

Step 3 mistakenly references the number 20 instead of 15 from the question, only resulting in an operand error in the formula, so it belongs to referencing_context_value_error. Steps 4 and 5, as its subsequent related steps, reference the wrong result of step 3, resulting in the incorrect final answer."
