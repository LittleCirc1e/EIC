This affects the subsequent related steps, changing step 2 from 800 square feet/side * 2 sides = 1600 square feet to 120 feet/side * 2 sides = 240 feet, step 3 changes from 1600 square feet/roof * 3 roofs = 4800 square feet to 240 feet/roof * 3 roofs = 720 feet, and step 4 changes from 4800 square feet * 8 shingles/square foot = 38400 shingles to 720 feet * 8 shingles/square foot = 5760 shingles.
