        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the area and perimeter of rectangle. The question requires that the area of the rectangular walls to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the length plus width plus length plus width, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle, resulting in 30 feet * 12 feet = 360 square feet in the original_solution becoming 30 feet + 12 feet + 30 feet + 12 feet = 84 square feet in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 2, changing from 360 square feet * 2 = 720 square feet to 84 square feet * 2 = 168 square feet. Note that step 3 correctly calculates the area of the short wall, and there is consistent error carried through to step 4. In the explanation for step 1, the language description < First find the area of one of the long walls > remains unchanged while the calculation reflects the perimeter rather than the area.",
