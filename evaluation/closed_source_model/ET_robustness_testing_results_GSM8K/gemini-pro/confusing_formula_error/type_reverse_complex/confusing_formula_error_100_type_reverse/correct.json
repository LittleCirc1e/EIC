        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and area of rectangle. The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the sum of all four sides, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle, resulting in 8 x 12 = 96 in the original_solution becoming 8 + 12 + 8 + 12 = 40 in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 2, changing from 96 x 8 = 768 to 40 x 8 = 320. Note that the language description of step 1 < The area of a glass pane is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 1 mistakenly uses the formula of rectangular area, while step 2 still correctly uses the formula of multiplication for the number of panes, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",
