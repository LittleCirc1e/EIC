In the original_solution, step 3 calculates the hours Carl works per month by referencing the hours he works every day (6), which is found by subtracting 2 from the 8 hours Josh works a day in step 1. After deleting step 3, step 4 in the transformed_solution references the 160 hours from step 1 directly when calculating Carl's earnings. This simplifies Carl's monthly earnings calculation to 160 hours/month * $4.5/hour, which results in $720 per month for Carl. The transformed_solution combines steps 1 and 3 of the original_solution, assuming Carl works the same number of hours as Josh. The next step updates step 5 in the original_solution with the new combined total of $2160 instead of $1980.

The original step 1 involves adding the two 50m trips together for a total of 100m. By removing this step, we no longer account for the return trip from school, and thus the calculation in the transformed solution refers to only one leg of the journey from the house to the school (50m). Since in our transformation we remove step 1, we then modify step 2 to include only one 50m trip, changing the formula from 140m - 100m = 40 meters to 140m - 50m = 90 meters. It should be noted that while the calculation itself is algebraically correct, the premise is wrong because it does not consider the entire trip.

As this step has been deleted, the transformed_solution should now directly use the adult's portion for calculating the child dinosaur's portion; however, to ensure the transformed_answer differs from the original_answer, we mistakenly multiply the number of child dinosaurs by the full adult portion (10 lbs) instead of the correct half portion (5 lbs). Therefore, we've changed step 2 to multiply the number of child dinosaurs by the full portion: '5*10=50 pounds of potato salad.' Since subsequent related steps rely on the previous step's result, step 3 also changes and adds this error into the total calculation, changing from '200+25=225 pounds of potato salad' to '200+50=250 pounds of potato salad.'
