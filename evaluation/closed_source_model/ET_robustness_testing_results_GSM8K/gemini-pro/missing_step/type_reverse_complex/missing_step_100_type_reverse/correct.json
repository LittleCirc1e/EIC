        "question": "Marcus has received a commission for as many paintings as possible. Marcus plans out his drawings so that his client can receive some of the paintings as soon as possible but it is still going to take a long time. On the first day, he paints 2 paintings. He then paints every day and each day, he paints twice as many paintings as he painted the day before. If he paints for 5 days, how many paintings will he have painted in total?",
        "original_solution": "If Marcus creates 2 paintings on the first day, then he can paint 2 paintings * 2 = 4 paintings on the 2nd day.\nSo he paints 4 paintings * 2 = 8 paintings on the 3rd day.\nHe then paints 8 paintings * 2 = 16 paintings on the 4th day.\nAnd finally paints 16 paintings * 2 = 32 paintings on the 5th day.\nMarcus therefore has painted a total of 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 paintings.\n#### 62",
        "original_answer": 62.0,
        "transformed_solution": "So Marcus paints 2 paintings * 2 = 4 paintings on the 2nd day.\nHe then paints 4 paintings * 2 = 8 paintings on the 3rd day.\nHe then paints 8 paintings * 2 = 16 paintings on the 4th day.\nAnd finally paints 16 paintings * 2 = 32 paintings on the 5th day.\nMarcus therefore has painted a total of 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 paintings.\n#### 124",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this transformation, the first step has been removed. Since the first step is missing, we need to adjust the final summation step (original Step 5) to compensate for this removal. The original solution went through 5 steps to show the progression of paintings from Day 1 to Day 5. By removing the first day's 2 paintings and not adjusting the final sum to account for this absence, it results in an error in calculation. Specifically, the final sum should still be 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 as in the original solution. However, in the transformed step, the summation incorrectly doubles the calculated total to 124, which becomes the transformed_answer. Therefore, the wrong_step is the last remaining one (number 5 in the sequence of steps that have not been deleted), as it improperly adjusts for the missing step and incorrectly doubles the total count, showing a calculation error.",

        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 6. Step 6 incorrectly calculates the total number of paintings as 124 instead of 62, which only results in an error in the result of the formula, so it belongs to calculation_error."

        "question": "Brian's friend Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does. If Brian has 20 video games but lost 5 right before the comparison was made, how many does Bobby have?",
        "original_solution": "If Brian previously had 20 video games but lost 5, that means he now has 20-5=15 video games\nBrian has 15 video games, so if Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many as Brian does we must first perform 15*3=45\nWe then subtract 5 from the previous total for 45-5=40 games in total.\n#### 40",
        "original_answer": 40.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Brian has 20 video games, so if Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many as Brian does we must first perform 20*3=60\nWe then subtract 5 from the previous total for 60-5=55 games in total.\n#### 55",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "By deleting the first step in the original_solution, the immediate next step in the transformed_solution should directly reference Brian's original number of video games instead of his number after losing 5 games. The original step 1 references 20 from the question, and step 2 references the result 15 of step 1. After deleting step 1, step 2 is changed to reference the number 20 from the question. Since multiple numbers weren't referenced by step 1, we keep the sequence as is, resulting in the formula 20*3=60. Consequently, in the transformed_solution, step 1 is the first step now, but it is based on the original step 2, which results in the wrong count of video games. The wrong_step is therefore identified as step 1 because it is the first step that references an incorrect number in the transformed_solution.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_type": "missing_step",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 does not subtract 5 from 20 to get the number of video games Brian has after losing 5 video games, but directly multiplies 20 by 3, which is the number of video games Brian had before losing 5 video games. So there is a missing step here to subtract 5 from 20, and this error belongs to missing_step. Step 3, as the subsequent step of step 2, references the wrong result of step 2, resulting in the incorrect final answer."

        "question": "The last time Bob cut his hair he cut it to 6 inches.  His hair is now 36 inches long.  If hair grows at a rate of .5 inches per month how many years did it take him to grow out his hair?",
        "original_solution": "His hair grew 36 inches - 6 inches = 30 inches\nHair grows at a rate of 12 months/year * 0.5 inches/month =6 inches/year\nIt took him 30 inches / 6 inches/year = 5 years to grow his hair out.\n#### 5",

        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In the transformed_solution, the first step is altered and contains a mathematically incorrect operation. Instead of subtracting the starting length from the current length (36 inches - 6 inches), the current length is incorrectly multiplied by the number of months in a year (36 inches * 12 months/year), leading to a result of 432 inches. The transformed solution's step 1 results in an incorrect calculation that does not represent the hair growth correctly, therefore directly leading to the wrong answer that it took 72 years for Bob to grow out his hair. The sequence of steps in the transformed_solution erroneously inflated the hair growth, directly affecting the subsequent computations, which are also incorrect but follow from the initial error in step 1. The error is classified as a calculation error and wrong_step is identified as 1 because that is where the first incorrect operation occurred.",

This error only occurs in the operand of the formula, so it belongs to calculation_error. Step 3 and 4, as the subsequent steps of step 2, reference the wrong result of step 2, resulting in the incorrect final answer."
