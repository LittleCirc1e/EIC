        "explanation": "This example removes intermediate step 3. In the original_solution, step 3 references the result 20 from step 2, and step 4 references the result 70 from step 3. Therefore, after deleting step 3, step 4 should reference the result 30 from step 2 and change the formula from 30 + 40 = 70 to 100 - 30 = 70. The deletion of the intermediate step also leads to recalculating the number of pages used in step 5 by subtracting from the total number of pages instead of adding the numbers from step 2. This leads to 30 - 10 = 20 pages used. Finally, the number of photos that can be placed on the remaining pages (step 6) changes from 30 divided by 10 to 70 divided by 20, resulting in an answer of 3.5 photos per page. It is step 2 in the transformed_solution, which is step 4 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing incorrect numbers in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 2.",

However, the correct process is to find the number of orange marbles first before calculating the number of purple marbles as 4 times the orange marbles. The subsequent step also changes: it no longer includes orange marbles in the total count, making the formula change from 13+4+16=33 to 13+16=29.
