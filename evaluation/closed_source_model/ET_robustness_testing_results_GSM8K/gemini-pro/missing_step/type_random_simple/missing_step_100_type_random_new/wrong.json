Thus, step 4 should transition from referencing Jeff's skips in round one to directly referencing Sam's skips from the question. In round one, Jeff did 16 - 1 skips (15 skips), so the 15 is no longer calculated and 16 is used directly in the total computation instead. The updated formula is 'Jeff completed 16 + 13 + 20 + 8 = 57 skips in total.' This mistake modifies the rest of the calculations, leading to an altered total and average. In step 5, which previously added up Jeff's total skips, the number 15 from step 1 is replaced by 16, the number in the question, adjusting the total.

Since in our transformation we remove step 1, we then modify step 2 to include only one 50m trip, changing the formula from 140m - 100m = 40 meters to 140m - 50m = 90 meters. It should be noted that while the calculation itself is algebraically correct, the premise is wrong because it does not consider the entire trip.
