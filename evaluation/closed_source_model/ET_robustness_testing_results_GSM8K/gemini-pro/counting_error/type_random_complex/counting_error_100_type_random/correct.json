        "question": "It’s exam season and Tristan has several exams to prepare for. On Monday, he studies for 4 hours then studies for twice this long on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday he studies for 3 hours each day. He wants to study for a total of 25 hours over the week and divides the remaining amount of study time evenly between Saturday and Sunday. How many hours does Tristan spend studying on Saturday?",
        "original_solution": "On Tuesday, Tristan studies twice as long as he did on Monday and this amounts to 4 hours * 2 = 8 hours.\nSo in the first 5 days of the week, he studies for a total of 4 hours Monday + 8 hours Tuesday + 3 hours Wednesday + 3 hours Thursday + 3 hours Friday = 21 hours.\nHe therefore has 25 planned hours – 21 used hours = 4 hours left to study.\nAs he splits his time evenly over 2 days, he spends 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours studying on Saturday.\n#### 2",
        "original_answer": 2,
        "transformed_solution": "On Tuesday, Tristan studies twice as long as he did on Monday and this amounts to 4 hours * 2 = 8 hours.\nSo in the first 5 days of the week, he studies for a total of 4 hours Monday + 8 hours Tuesday + 3 hours Wednesday + 3 hours Thursday + 3 hours Friday = 21 hours.\nHe therefore has 25 planned hours – 21 used hours = 4 hours left to study.\nAs he intends to split his time over the weekend, but mistakenly counts that as 1 day, he spends 4 hours / 1 = 4 hours studying on Saturday.\n#### 4",

        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 4 of the transformed_solution incorrectly assumes that the weekend is 1 day instead of 2, therefore changing 4 hours / 2 to 4 hours / 1. The mistake results in Tristan spending all 4 remaining hours on Saturday as opposed to dividing them evenly between Saturday and Sunday. This counting error affects only the final step related to the allocation of study hours over the weekend and the subsequent calculation of hours studied on Saturday, without affecting previous or unrelated steps.",

        "pred_wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 6. Step 6 mistakenly counts Saturday and Sunday as 1 day instead of 2 days, only resulting in an operand error in the formula, so it belongs to counting_error."

        "question": "If a vehicle is driven 12 miles on Monday, 18 miles on Tuesday, and 21 miles on Wednesday. What is the average distance traveled per day?",
        "original_solution": "The total distance covered from Monday to Wednesday is 12 + 18 + 21 = 51 miles.\nSo the average distance traveled per day is 51/3 = 17 miles.\n#### 17",
        "original_answer": 17.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total distance covered from Monday to Wednesday is 12 + 18 + 21 = 51 miles.\nBut here we mistakenly consider that Monday to Wednesday counts as 2 days.\nSo the average distance traveled per day is 51/2 = 25.5 miles.\n#### 25.5",

        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, we make a counting error by incorrectly considering the number of days from Monday to Wednesday as only 2 days instead of the actual 3 days. This error subsequently affects the calculation of the average distance, changing the correct operation 51/3 to the incorrect operation 51/2. It should be noted that this is a single counting error and the sum of the distances remains unchanged, as it is not part of the error.",
