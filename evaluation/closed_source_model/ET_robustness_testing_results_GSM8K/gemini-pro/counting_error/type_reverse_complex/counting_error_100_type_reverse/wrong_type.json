        "question": "On the weekend, Tony will walk to the store. On weekdays, he runs to the store. When he walks, he goes 2 MPH. When he runs he goes 10 MPH. The store is 4 miles away. If he goes on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, what is the average time in minutes that he spends to get to the store?",
        "original_solution": "On Sunday he takes 2 hours to get there because 4 / 2 = 2\nThis takes him 120 minutes because 2 x 60 = 120\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him .4 hours to get to the store because 4 / 10 = .4\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him 24 minutes to get to the store because .4 x 60 = 24\nIn total it takes him 168 minutes to get to the store because 120 + 24 + 24 = 168\nOn average it takes him 56 minutes because 168 / 3 = 56\n#### 56",

        "explanation": "Here, the wrong step (5) erroneously counts the time taken on Tuesday and Thursday as 48 minutes in total instead of 24 + 24 = 48 minutes, which should have been unchanged from the original solution. Therefore, instead of adding 120 + 24 + 24 = 168, we erroneously added 120 + 48 = 168. Consequently, the final step calculation also changed from 168 / 3 = 56 to 192 / 3 = 64, although it was performed correctly given the wrong input.",

        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 5. Step 5 erroneously references the result 140 of step 2 instead of 120, which only results in an error in one operand in the formula, therefore it belongs to referencing_previous_step_value_error. Its subsequent step 6 references the result of step 5, resulting in the incorrect final answer."

The incorrect multiplication of 0.50 x 2 = 1.0 hours replaces the correct calculation of 0.50 x 3 = 1.5 hours. This affects the last step, changing the sum from 2.5 + 1.5 = 4 hours to 2.5 + 1.0 = 3.5 hours. The other calculations leading up to the erroneous step remain correct.",
