        "question": "Jason sent 220 text messages on Monday, half as many text messages on Tuesday, and 50 text messages each day Wednesday through Friday. How many text messages did he send on average during those five days?",
        "original_solution": "First find how many text messages he sent on Tuesday: 220 messages / 2 = 110 messages\nThen find how many text messages he sent Wednesday-Friday: 50 messages/day * 3 days = 150 messages\nThen add up all the messages he sent to find the total: 110 messages + 150 messages + 220 messages = 480 messages\nThen divide that number by the number of days to find the average number of messages he sent per day: 480 messages / 5 days = 96 messages/day\n#### 96",
        "original_answer": 96,
        "transformed_solution": "First find how many text messages he sent on Tuesday: 220 messages / 2 = 110 messages\nThen find how many text messages he sent Wednesday-Friday: 50 messages/day * 2 days = 100 messages\nThen add up all the messages he sent to find the total: 110 messages + 100 messages + 220 messages = 430 messages\nThen divide that number by the number of days to find the average number of messages he sent per day: 430 messages / 5 days = 86 messages/day\n#### 86",

        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 incorrectly counts Wednesday through Friday as 2 days instead of 3 days to find the number of messages sent on those days (changing from '50 messages/day * 3 days = 150 messages' to '50 messages/day * 2 days = 100 messages'), which also affects the total messages count in step 3 (from 480 to 430 messages) and the calculated average number of messages in step 4 (from 96 messages/day to 86 messages/day). It is ensured that only the counting error is introduced and the division calculation is performed correctly.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_type": "none",
        "type_explanation": "The solution is correct because it correctly calculates the average number of text messages Jason sent per day by adding up the total number of messages he sent on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and then dividing that number by the number of days."
