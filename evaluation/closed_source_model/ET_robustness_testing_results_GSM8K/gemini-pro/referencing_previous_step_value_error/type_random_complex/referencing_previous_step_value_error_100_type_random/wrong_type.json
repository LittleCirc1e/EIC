        "explanation": "Step 5 mistakenly references 75 as 80 from step 4 and changes 75=(3/2)x to 80=(3/2)x. It should be noted that step 4 in the transformed_solution <70=(3/2)x-5> should be the same as the step 4 in the original_solution <70=(3/2)x-5> and calculates its result 75 correctly. The changed reference affects only the subsequent steps that directly involve the value from the erroneous step but still uses correct arithmetic. Therefore, step 6 is affected by step 5 and changes from 75=(3/2)x to 80=(3/2)x, leading to an incorrect value for x. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all other steps is still correct.",
