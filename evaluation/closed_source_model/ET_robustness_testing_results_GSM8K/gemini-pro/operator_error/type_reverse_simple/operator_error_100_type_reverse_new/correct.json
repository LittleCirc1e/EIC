All of the rubber ducks will be dropped into the river at the same time and the first duck that floats across the finish line wins. They sold 221 regular size ducks and 185 large size ducks. How much money did the city raise for charity?",

This error affects the subsequent related step 3. Step 3's addition remains the same, and as a result of step 2's error, it changes from 663+925 = $1,588.00 to 663+37 = $700.00.
