        "original_solution": "For every addition of 100 people added the speed is halved so for the first 100 people added its speed is 1/2 * 500 km/hr = 250 km/hr.\nFor another addition of 100 people its speed is also halved, 1/2 * 250 km/hr = 125 km/hr. So for the total of 200 additional people, its speed is 125 km/hr\n#### 125",

        "original_solution": "Today the Dow was down 8722 / 98*2 = 178.\nSo it started at 8722 + 178 = 8900.\n#### 8900",

The mistake in the first step carries over to the second step '8722 + 188 = 8910' to maintain the inherited error. The subsequent step is affected by using the erroneous result of 188; however, this step is still calculated correctly based on the new wrong input. The original step is '8722 + 178 = 8900', and the transformed solution alters the outcome to '8722 + 188 = 8910'. The transformed answer is therefore 8910, which is different from the original answer of 8900. This simulates a single miscalculation without changing any operands or operators in the formula.",
