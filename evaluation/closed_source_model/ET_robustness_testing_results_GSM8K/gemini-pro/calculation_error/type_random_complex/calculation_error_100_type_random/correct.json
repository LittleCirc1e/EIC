He bought a gallon of milk for $3, two boxes of cereal for $3.5 each, 4 bananas for $.25 each, four apples that cost $.5 each and a number of boxes of cookies. The cookies cost twice as much per box as the gallon of milk. How many boxes of cookies did he get?",
        "original_solution": "He spent $7 on cereal because 2 x 3.5 = 7\nHe spent $1 on bananas because 4 x .25 = 1\nHe spent $2 on apples because 4 x .5 = 2\nHe spent 13 on everything but the cookies because 3 + 7 + 1 + 2 = 13\nHe spent $12 on cookies because 25 - 13 = 12\nEach box of cookies is $6 because 3 x 2 = 6\nHe bought 2 boxes of cookies because 12 / 6 = 2\n#### 2",

        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates the total spent on everything but cookies as $11 instead of $13 in step 4, which affects the subsequent calculation of the money spent on cookies in step 5. The modified formula in step 5 becomes 25 - 11 = 14 instead of 25 - 13 = 12. Step 6 and step 7 remain unaffected as they do not rely on the result of step 4 or step 5. As a result, the error is confined to step 4's calculation and its immediate consequence on step 5, leaving all other steps and their calculations as correct. In step 7, the number of boxes of cookies is inaccurately calculated based on the mistaken $14 value, yielding 14 / 6 = 2.33 boxes of cookies.",
