        "question": "An organization trying to save endangered species of turtles has taken twice more hawksbill turtles than the number of green turtles into a conservation center. If the number of green turtles is 800, calculate the number of turtles that have been taken into the conservation center.",
        "original_solution": "If the number of hawksbill turtles is twice more than the number of green turtles, then there are 2*800 = 1600 more hawksbill turtles.\nThe total number of hawksbill turtles is 800+1600 = 2400\nThe total number of turtles that have been taken into the conservation center is 2400+800 = 3200 turtles.\n#### 3200",
        "original_answer": 3200.0,
        "transformed_solution": "If the number of hawksbill turtles is twice more than the number of green turtles, then there are 2*800 = 1600 more hawksbill turtles.\nAdditional loggerhead turtles equal to half the number of green turtles were also taken in, so there are 800/2 = 400 loggerhead turtles.\nThe total number of hawksbill turtles is 800+1600 = 2400\nThe total number of turtles that have been taken into the conservation center is 2400+800+400 = 3600 turtles.\n#### 3600",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 2 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <Additional loggerhead turtles equal to half the number of green turtles were also taken in>, resulting in step 2 changing from calculating only hawksbill and green turtles to also including loggerhead turtles in the transformed_solution. The new step integrated is 800/2 = 400 loggerhead turtles, which is then added to the total count, changing the answer from 3200 turtles to 3600 turtles.",

        "pred_wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 1, where the number of hawksbill turtles is incorrectly calculated as 2*800 = 1600. The correct calculation should be 800 + 2*800 = 2400 hawksbill turtles. This error is a calculation error because the operands are correct, but the result of the calculation is incorrect. The subsequent steps that reference this result are therefore also incorrect, leading to the wrong final answer."

        "question": "Mark just got a new puppy that cost $10. He also bought enough food for 3 weeks. He knows the puppy eats 1/3 cup of food a day. A bag of food with 3.5 cups costs $2. How much did all of this cost him?",
        "original_solution": "He needs food for 21 days because 3 x 7 = 21\nThe puppy will eat 7 cups of food because 21 x (1/3) = 7\nHe needs 2 bags of food because 7 / 3.5 = 2\nThe food will cost him $4 because 2 x 2 = 4\nIt will cost $14 in total because 10 + 4 = 14\n#### 14",
        "original_answer": 14.0,
        "transformed_solution": "He needs food for 21 days because 3 x 7 = 21\nBecause the puppy is a fast grower, his food intake will increase to 1/2 cup a day by the third week. He will eat 5 + (7 * (1/2)) = 8.5 cups of food in total.\nHe needs 3 bags of food because 8.5 / 3.5 is approximately 2.43 and he can't buy a fraction of a bag.\nThus, rounding up, the food will cost him $6 because 3 x 2 = 6\nIt will cost $16 in total because 10 + 6 = 16\n#### 16",

        "explanation": "Step 2 of the original solution is modified to add information not mentioned in the question: <Because the puppy is a fast grower, his food intake will increase to 1/2 cup a day by the third week>. This change affects the total amount of food the puppy will eat, increasing it from 7 cups to 8.5 cups. As a result, Mark needs to buy 3 bags of food instead of 2, changing the total cost from $14 to $16. The error of adding irrelevant information leads to a single wrong transformation of the original solution's outcome.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 2. The calculation of the total food intake is incorrect. The puppy eats 1/3 cup a day for the first two weeks, which is 14 days, and then 1/2 cup a day for the third week, which is 7 days. The correct calculation should be (14 * (1/3)) + (7 * (1/2)) = (14/3) + (7/2) = (28/6) + (21/6) = 49/6 cups, which is approximately 8.17 cups, not 8.5 cups. This error in calculation affects the subsequent steps that reference its results and leads to the final wrong result."
