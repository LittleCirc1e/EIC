        "original_solution": "The first 3 pieces each cost 45000/3=$15,000\nSo the next piece was 15,000*.5=$7,500 more expensive\nThat means it cost 15,000+7,500=$22,500\nThat means in total he spent 45,000+22,500=$67,500\n#### 67,500",

This affects the final total cost calculation, changing it from $45,000 + $22,500 = $67,500 in the original_solution to $45,000 + $22,500 + $2,250 = $69,750 in the transformed_solution.
