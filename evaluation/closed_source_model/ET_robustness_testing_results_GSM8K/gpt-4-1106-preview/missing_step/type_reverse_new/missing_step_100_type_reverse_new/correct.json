On the second day, he holds it for 20 seconds. On the third day, he holds it for 30 seconds. After realizing that he can hold it for ten extra seconds each day, he realizes he can calculate how many days it is until he reaches 90 if he keeps up the same pace. So how many days until he can hold his breath for 90 seconds?",

After removing this step, the 60 seconds of improvement mentioned in the result no longer has context, and the solution incorrectly assumes that Chris is starting from 0 seconds, which leads to dividing 90 by 10 to recommend 9 days of training. Since the deleted first step referenced the number 30 from the question, the transformed answer should still reflect the additional 60 seconds of improvement needed.
