        "question": "Marcus has received a commission for as many paintings as possible. Marcus plans out his drawings so that his client can receive some of the paintings as soon as possible but it is still going to take a long time. On the first day, he paints 2 paintings. He then paints every day and each day, he paints twice as many paintings as he painted the day before. If he paints for 5 days, how many paintings will he have painted in total?",
        "original_solution": "If Marcus creates 2 paintings on the first day, then he can paint 2 paintings * 2 = 4 paintings on the 2nd day.\nSo he paints 4 paintings * 2 = 8 paintings on the 3rd day.\nHe then paints 8 paintings * 2 = 16 paintings on the 4th day.\nAnd finally paints 16 paintings * 2 = 32 paintings on the 5th day.\nMarcus therefore has painted a total of 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 paintings.\n#### 62",
        "original_answer": 62.0,
        "transformed_solution": "So Marcus paints 2 paintings * 2 = 4 paintings on the 2nd day.\nHe then paints 4 paintings * 2 = 8 paintings on the 3rd day.\nHe then paints 8 paintings * 2 = 16 paintings on the 4th day.\nAnd finally paints 16 paintings * 2 = 32 paintings on the 5th day.\nMarcus therefore has painted a total of 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 paintings.\n#### 124",

        "wrong_step": 5,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this transformation, the first step has been removed. Since the first step is missing, we need to adjust the final summation step (original Step 5) to compensate for this removal. The original solution went through 5 steps to show the progression of paintings from Day 1 to Day 5. By removing the first day's 2 paintings and not adjusting the final sum to account for this absence, it results in an error in calculation. Specifically, the final sum should still be 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 as in the original solution. However, in the transformed step, the summation incorrectly doubles the calculated total to 124, which becomes the transformed_answer. Therefore, the wrong_step is the last remaining one (number 5 in the sequence of steps that have not been deleted), as it improperly adjusts for the missing step and incorrectly doubles the total count, showing a calculation error.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "type_explanation": "The operands and operators used to sum up the total number of paintings are correct, but the final calculation is incorrect. The correct total should be 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62, not 124."
