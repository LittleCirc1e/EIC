        "original_solution": "Liam's age two years ago was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.\nVince's age two years ago was 14/2 = 7 years old because Liam's age is twice his.\nSo Vince age now is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.\n#### 9",
        "original_answer": 9.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Vince's age two years ago was 16/2 = 8 years old because Liam's age is twice his.\nSo Vince's age now is 8 + 2 = 10 years old.\n#### 10",

        "explanation": "In the original_solution, step 1 calculates Liam’s age two years ago. However, the transformed_solution removes this first step. As a consequence, step 1 in the transformed_solution, which originally is step 2 in the original_solution, directly references the number 16 from the question, which leads to Vince’s age being half of 16 instead of half of Liam’s age two years ago. This results in a transformed answer of 10, which is incorrect. The error in the new step 1 is due to the fact that it incorrectly calculates Vince’s age as half of Liam’s current age rather than half of Liam’s age two years ago. Since the original step 1 is absent, the subsequent related step (the new step 1) becomes the wrong step.",

        "type_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates Vince's age two years ago by dividing Liam's age at that time by 2, and then correctly adds 2 years to find Vince's current age. There are no errors in the solution."

        "original_solution": "Madeline spends 4*7=28 hours on homework.\nShe spends 8*7-56 hours sleeping.\nTherefore, she is busy 28+18+56+20=122 hours per week.\nThere are 7*24=168 hours per week.\nThus, Madeline has 168-122=46 hours left over.\n#### 46",

        "explanation": "In the transformed_solution, the first step, which references the number 4 from the question, is removed. Step 2 of the original_solution, which uses the result 28 from the deleted step, now references the number 4 directly and recalculates the total hours busy per week. The calculation changes from 28+18+56+20=122 to 4*7+18+56+20=144. This does not affect the calculation of step 3 at all, which remains the same. Since step 1 was deleted, we start from step 2 in the transformed_solution, which is a combination of step 1 and step 3 from the original solution. Therefore, the first step that contains an error is step 2 in the transformed_solution, which is equivalent to step 3 in the original_solution. So the wrong_step is 2.",
