        "question": "Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liam’s age was twice the age of Vince. How old is Vince now?",
        "original_solution": "Liam's age two years ago was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.\nVince's age two years ago was 14/2 = 7 years old because Liam's age is twice his.\nSo Vince age now is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.\n#### 9",
        "original_answer": 9.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Vince's age two years ago was 16/2 = 8 years old because Liam's age is twice his.\nSo Vince's age now is 8 + 2 = 10 years old.\n#### 10",

        "explanation": "In the original_solution, step 1 calculates Liam’s age two years ago. However, the transformed_solution removes this first step. As a consequence, step 1 in the transformed_solution, which originally is step 2 in the original_solution, directly references the number 16 from the question, which leads to Vince’s age being half of 16 instead of half of Liam’s age two years ago. This results in a transformed answer of 10, which is incorrect. The error in the new step 1 is due to the fact that it incorrectly calculates Vince’s age as half of Liam’s current age rather than half of Liam’s age two years ago. Since the original step 1 is absent, the subsequent related step (the new step 1) becomes the wrong step.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_type": "none",
        "type_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates Vince's age two years ago by dividing Liam's age at that time (16 - 2 = 14) by 2, which gives 7. Then it correctly adds 2 years to find Vince's current age, which is 7 + 2 = 9. The final answer provided in the solution is incorrect, but since the question asks to evaluate the steps provided in the solution and not the final answer, the steps themselves are correct."

        "question": "Chris wants to hold his breath underwater for 90 straight seconds so he starts training each day. On the first day, he holds it for 10 seconds. On the second day, he holds it for 20 seconds. On the third day, he holds it for 30 seconds. After realizing that he can hold it for ten extra seconds each day, he realizes he can calculate how many days it is until he reaches 90 if he keeps up the same pace. So how many days until he can hold his breath for 90 seconds?",
        "original_solution": "He still has to improve by 60 more seconds because 90 - 30 = 60\nThis will take 6 days because 60 / 10 = 6\n#### 6",

        "explanation": "The first step of the original solution has been removed. Originally, this step calculates the remaining seconds by subtracting 30 (the result of the third day) from 90. After removing this step, the 60 seconds of improvement mentioned in the result no longer has context, and the solution incorrectly assumes that Chris is starting from 0 seconds, which leads to dividing 90 by 10 to recommend 9 days of training. Since the deleted first step referenced the number 30 from the question, the transformed answer should still reflect the additional 60 seconds of improvement needed. However, the error in the transformation directly references 90 instead of the correct context, which is why the wrong_step is 1.",

In the original_solution, step 1 establishes Steve's height before growth, which is referenced in step 2 (final step). After deleting step 1, the calculation from step 1 needs to be incorporated into the next step (now the first and only step). The number 66 from step 2, derived from step 1 in the original solution, is replaced with the full calculation that includes the original 5'6\" height expressed in inches (5*12+6) and the growth of 6 inches. Therefore, the transformed formula is 5*12+6+6=78. This is the first and only step in the transformed_solution that outputs a different transformed_answer of 78 inches, making the wrong_step 1.",

        "explanation": "In this transformation, I have deleted the first step, which involves Andy's return trip from school to his house. The original step 1 involves adding the two 50m trips together for a total of 100m. By removing this step, we no longer account for the return trip from school, and thus the calculation in the transformed solution refers to only one leg of the journey from the house to the school (50m). Since in our transformation we remove step 1, we then modify step 2 to include only one 50m trip, changing the formula from 140m - 100m = 40 meters to 140m - 50m = 90 meters. It should be noted that while the calculation itself is algebraically correct, the premise is wrong because it does not consider the entire trip. The first step (now also the wrong_step) references the correct number from the question and no intermediate steps are present, thus making the entire reasoning incorrect and leading to a different transformed answer.",
