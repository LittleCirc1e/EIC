        "question": "The rim of a standard basketball hoop is 10 feet above the ground.  Additionally, most experts will say that a player must be able to reach at least 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball.  Suppose a basketball player is 6 feet tall and can reach 22 inches above their head using the wingspan of their arms.  How high must this player be able to jump to reach 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball?",
        "original_solution": "In inches, the height of the rim is 10*12 = 120 inches.\nThus, the height that the player needs to be able to reach is 120 + 6 = 126 inches.\nWithout jumping, the player can reach their height plus an additional 22 inches, or a total of 6*12 + 22 = 94 inches.\nTherefore, the player needs to jump 126 - 94 = 32 inches to reach the height required to dunk a basketball.\n#### 32",
        "original_answer": 32.0,
        "transformed_solution": "In inches, the height of the rim is 11*12 = 132 inches.\nThus, the height that the player needs to be able to reach is 132 + 6 = 138 inches.\nWithout jumping, the player can reach their height plus an additional 22 inches, or a total of 6*12 + 22 = 94 inches.\nTherefore, the player needs to jump 138 - 94 = 44 inches to reach the height required to dunk a basketball.\n#### 44",

        "wrong_type": "referencing_context_value_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 1 references 10 in the question as 11 wrongly and calculates 11*12=132 instead of 10*12=120. Its subsequent related steps, step 2 and 4, will be affected. Step 2 changes from 120+6=126 to 132+6=138, and step 4 changes from 126-94=32 to 138-94=44. Please note that you should only consider one error, so step 3 still references 6 in the question correctly.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_type": "none",
        "type_explanation": "All steps in the solution correctly convert measurements to a consistent unit (inches), perform the necessary arithmetic operations, and logically follow from one to the next without any irrelevant information, formula confusion, missing steps, operator errors, unit conversion errors, referencing errors, counting errors, or calculation errors."
