        "question": "Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?",
        "original_solution": "We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = 200 books.\nSo the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = 600 books.\n#### 600",
        "original_answer": 600.0,
        "transformed_solution": "We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 * 66 = 2940 books.\nSo the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 - 2940 = -2140 books.\n#### -2140",

        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example changes the addition of 44 + 66 to multiplication, 44 * 66, in step 1. As a result, the total number of books that were sold is incorrectly increased from 200 to 2940 books, affecting the calculation in the subsequent step. The calculation for the total number of unsold books then becomes 800 - 2940 = -2140, which is an incorrect number because you cannot have a negative number of books unsold. It should be noted that the error is only in the operator changed in step 1, but the calculations for step 1 and step 2 are done correctly based on the erroneous operation.",

        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 1. Step 1 mistakenly uses multiplication instead of addition for the last two numbers, and only one operator in the formula is incorrect, so it belongs to operator_error."

        "question": "A conference center has six rooms. Each room can hold up to 80 people. Today, the conference center is only 2/3 full. How many people are in the conference center?",
        "original_solution": "The conference center can hold up to 80 x 6 = 480 people.\nToday, there are 480 x 2/3 = 320 people in the conference center.\n#### 320",
        "original_answer": 320.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The conference center can hold up to 80 x 6 = 480 people.\nToday, there are 480 - 2/3 = 479.3333 people in the conference center.\n#### 479.3333",

Its subsequent step 2 related to it inherits its result, the transformed answer becomes 479.3333. It should be noted that step 2 only changes the operator of the formula, but still correctly calculates its result. Step 2 only inherits the result of step 1, but its calculation is correct.",
