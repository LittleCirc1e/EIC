        "explanation": "This example changes the addition of 44 + 66 to multiplication, 44 * 66, in step 1. As a result, the total number of books that were sold is incorrectly increased from 200 to 2940 books, affecting the calculation in the subsequent step. The calculation for the total number of unsold books then becomes 800 - 2940 = -2140, which is an incorrect number because you cannot have a negative number of books unsold. It should be noted that the error is only in the operator changed in step 1, but the calculations for step 1 and step 2 are done correctly based on the erroneous operation.",
