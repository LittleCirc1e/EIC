        "explanation": "This example turns the multiplication in step 2 into division, and by changing * to /, 20*6=120 becomes 20/6=3.333. This affects the subsequent related step 3 and 4. Step 3 changes from 120/60=2 hours to 3.333/60=0.05555 hours, and step 4 changes from 2/2=1 hour to 0.05555/2=0.027775 hour. It should be noted that only the operator in step 2 is incorrect, but its calculation is correct, which leads to its result being incorrect. This affects the subsequent steps of using its results, but all the calculation of the steps affected by step 2 is correct.",

        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 2, where the solution incorrectly divides the number of trees by the time it takes to clean each tree, instead of multiplying. This is an operator error because the correct operator (multiplication) is replaced with the incorrect operator (division). This error affects all subsequent calculations, leading to the final incorrect result."

        "question": "4 friends are running a 4 x 100 relay race. Mary ran first and took twice as long as Susan. Susan ran second and she took 10 seconds longer than Jen. Jen ran third and finished in 30 seconds. Tiffany ran the last leg and finished in 7 seconds less than Mary. How many seconds did it take the team to finish the race?",
        "original_solution": "Susan's time was 30 seconds + 10 seconds = 40 seconds.\nMary's time was 40 seconds * 2 = 80 seconds.\nTiffany's time was 80 seconds - 7 seconds = 73 seconds.\nThe total time for the team was 80 seconds + 40 seconds + 30 seconds + 73 seconds = 223 seconds.\n#### 223",

        "explanation": "This example changes the subtraction operator in step 3 to division, turning 80 seconds - 7 seconds into 80 seconds / 7 seconds. The result of the modified step 3 is calculated correctly based on the operator change, which is 11.43 seconds for Tiffany's time. This affects the overall calculation in step 4, where the total time for the team is now incorrectly computed based on the new, incorrect time for Tiffany, resulting in the sum of 80 + 40 + 30 + 11.43 seconds. All other steps and calculations are performed correctly, but the modified step 3 impacts the related final step, thereby altering the final result to be incorrect.",
