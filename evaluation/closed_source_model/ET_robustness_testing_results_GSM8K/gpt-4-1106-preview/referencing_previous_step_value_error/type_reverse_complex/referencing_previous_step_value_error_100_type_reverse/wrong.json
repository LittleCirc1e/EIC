        "question": "In a factory, there are 3 machines working 23 hours a day. The owner decided to buy a fourth machine, which works only 12 hours a day. One machine can produce 2 kg of material every hour. The factory sells the produced material for $50 per 1 kg. How much can this factory earn in one day?",
        "original_solution": "The total runtime for the first three machines is 3 machines * 23 hours/day/machine = 69 hours/day.\nSo these machines could produce 69 hours/day * 2 kg/hour = 138 kg/day.\nThe fourth machine could produce 12 hours/day * 2 kg/hour = 24 kg/day of material.\nIn total all the machines would produce 138 kg/day + 24 kg/day = 162 kg/day of material.\nThe factory would therefore earn 162 kg/day * $50/kg = $8100/day.\n#### 8100",

        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references the total produced by the first three machines as 138 kg/day and the fourth machine as 20 kg/day (implicitly, since 156 - 138 = 18, which could be misconstrued as 12 hours * 1.5 kg/hour for a total of 18 kg/day) from steps 2 and 3 by changing the correct sum 138 kg/day + 24 kg/day = 162 kg/day to an incorrect sum 138 kg/day + 24 kg/day = 156 kg/day. It should be noted that steps 2 and 3 in the transformed_solution should be the same as the steps 2 and 3 in the original_solution and should have their result numbers calculated correctly. Step 5, as the subsequent step of step 4, is affected and changes the total earning from 162 kg/day * $50/kg = $8100/day to 156 kg/day * $50/kg = $7800/day. The referencing error only occurs at step 4, and thus all calculations for the other steps are still correct. The consequence of this single referencing error is that the transformed_answer changes to $7800, which is different from the original_answer of $8100.",

        "original_solution": "Uncle Ben has 440 chickens - 39 roosters = 401 hens.\nUncle Ben has 401 hens - 15 that don't lay eggs = 386 hens that lay eggs.\nThe egg-laying hens each lay 3 eggs * 386 hens = 1158 eggs.\n#### 1158",

        "explanation": "Step 2 mistakenly references 401 as 401 from step 1 but changes 401 - 15 to 385 instead of the correct 386. It should be noted that step 1 in the transformed_solution <Uncle Ben has 440 chickens - 39 roosters = 401 hens.> should be the same as the step 1 in the original_solution <Uncle Ben has 440 chickens - 39 roosters = 401 hens.> and calculates its result 401 correctly. The subsequent step 3, which is related to step 2, is affected by the incorrect subtraction result but is still calculated correctly as 3 * 385 to give 1155 eggs. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all steps is still correct, and the transformed_answer 1155 is different from the original_answer 1158.",
