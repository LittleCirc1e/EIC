        "question": "Goldie makes $5 an hour for pet-sitting. Last week, she worked for 20 hours while this week, she worked for 30 hours. How much did Goldie earn in two weeks for pet-sitting?",
        "original_solution": "Goldie did pet-sitting for a total of 20 + 30 = 50 hours.\nSo, she earned a total of $5 x 50 = $250.\n#### 250",
        "original_answer": 250.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Goldie did pet-sitting for a total of 20 + 30 = 50 hours.\nSo, she earned a total of $5 x 40 = $200.\n#### 200",

        "wrong_type": "referencing_previous_step_value_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 2 mistakenly references 50 as 40 from step 1 and changes $5 x 50 = $250 to $5 x 40 = $200. It should be noted that step 1 in the transformed_solution <Goldie did pet-sitting for a total of 20 + 30 = 50 hours.> should be the same as the step 1 in the original_solution <Goldie did pet-sitting for a total of 20 + 30 = 50 hours.> and calculates its result 50 correctly. Because you need to only consider one error, the calculation of the erroneous step is still correctly performed using the erroneous figure.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_type": "referencing_previous_step_value_error",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 erroneously references the number 40 instead of 50 from the previous step, which only results in an error in one operand in the formula, therefore it belongs to referencing_previous_step_value_error. Its subsequent step leads to the incorrect final answer."
