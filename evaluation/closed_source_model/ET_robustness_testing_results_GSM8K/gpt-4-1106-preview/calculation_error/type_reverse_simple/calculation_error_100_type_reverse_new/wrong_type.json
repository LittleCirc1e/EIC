        "question": "Wendy just started working at an Italian restaurant. She polished 50 small glasses and 10 more large glasses than small glasses. How many glasses did she polish?",
        "original_solution": "She polished 50 + 10 = 60 large glasses.\nTherefore, Wendy polished 50 + 60 = 110 glasses.\n#### 110",
        "original_answer": 110.0,

        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, the calculation in the first step is changed incorrectly from 50 + 10 = 60 to 50 + 10 = 70. This is a calculation error where the sum of 50 and 10 is wrongly taken as 70 instead of the correct 60. The subsequent step inherits this error, changing the sum from 50 + 60 = 110 to 50 + 70 = 120, thus affecting the result of the total calculation. This single error impacted the final result without changing any operands or operators from the original solution. The calculation within the subsequent step is correct, but it incorrectly uses the erroneous result from the previous step.",

He adds 1 rep a day and once he gets to 15 reps he will start training high elevation push-ups. and then low elevation push-ups, and finally floor push-ups. How many weeks will it take him to get to floor push-ups?",

This is the only calculation error present, and hence there is a single error. The correct calculation should have yielded that it will take 9 weeks, not 7 weeks.

        "type_explanation": "The solution is missing the step of considering that John adds 1 rep each day, not starting at 15 reps for each type of push-up. He starts from 1 rep and adds 1 rep each day until he reaches 15 reps for wall push-ups, then starts over for high elevation push-ups, and again for low elevation push-ups. The calculation does not account for the cumulative nature of the progression."
