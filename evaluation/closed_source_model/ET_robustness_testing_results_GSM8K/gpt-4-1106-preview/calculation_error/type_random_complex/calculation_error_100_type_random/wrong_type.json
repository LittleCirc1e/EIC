        "original_solution": "Jack took 4 more candies than the half, and Paul took the rest, which means 7 + 4 = 11 candies were half of all candies.\nThat means at first there were 11 * 2 = 22 candies.\n#### 22",

This wrong step then impacts the rest of the solution, with the initial number of candies being incorrectly calculated as 12 * 2 = 24 instead of the correct 11 * 2 = 22. The error is consistent in that only the calculation has been changed, with no operands or operators being modified, and subsequent steps are all correctly calculated based on the erroneous intermediate value.",

He adds 1 rep a day and once he gets to 15 reps he will start training high elevation push-ups. and then low elevation push-ups, and finally floor push-ups. How many weeks will it take him to get to floor push-ups?",

This is the only calculation error present, and hence there is a single error. The correct calculation should have yielded that it will take 9 weeks, not 7 weeks.

        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 1. The solution does not include the necessary steps to account for the progression through each stage of push-ups (wall, high elevation, and low elevation) before reaching the floor push-ups. It incorrectly assumes that he can move through all stages in a single progression, which is not the case. If the solution included the steps to account for each stage, the reasoning would become correct. Therefore, the error belongs to missing_step."
