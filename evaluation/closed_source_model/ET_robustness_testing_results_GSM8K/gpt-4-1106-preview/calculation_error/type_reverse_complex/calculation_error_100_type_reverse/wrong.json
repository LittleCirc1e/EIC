        "question": "The stadium seats 60,000 fans, but only 75% of the seats were sold for the music show. Because of the threat of rain, 5,000 fans stayed home. How many attended the show?",
        "original_solution": "The number of seats sold was 0.75*60,000=45,000.\nAnd 45,000-5,000=40,000.\n#### 40,000",
        "original_answer": 40000.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The number of seats sold was 0.75*60,000=45,000.\nAnd 45,000-5,000=35,000.\n#### 35,000",

        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The example mistakenly calculates 45,000-5,000=35,000 instead of 45,000-5,000=40,000 in step 2. The error in the subtraction at step 2 affects only the final answer, not the initial calculation of seats sold (step 1). Note that the transformed solution only has one calculation error introduced, and subsequent steps correctly use the result from the erroneous step, following the pattern of inheriting the error.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_type": "none",
        "type_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the number of seats sold by multiplying the stadium's capacity by the percentage of seats sold (0.75 * 60,000 = 45,000). It then correctly subtracts the number of fans who stayed home due to rain (45,000 - 5,000 = 40,000) to find the number of attendees. There are no errors in the solution."
