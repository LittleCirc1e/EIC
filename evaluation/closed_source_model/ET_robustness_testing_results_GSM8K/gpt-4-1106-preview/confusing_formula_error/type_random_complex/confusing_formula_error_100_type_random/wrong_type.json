        "question": "The perimeter of a triangle is 160 cm. If two of the sides are 40 cm and 50 cm, calculate the length of the third side?",
        "original_solution": "To get the perimeter, you add all the sides of the triangle, so the first two sides add up to 40+50 = 90 cm.\nIf the perimeter of the triangle is 160, the remaining side is 160-90 = 70 cm.\n#### 70",
        "original_answer": 70.0,
        "transformed_solution": "To get the perimeter, you add all the sides of the triangle, so the first two sides add up to 40*50 = 2000 cm.\nIf the perimeter of the triangle is 160, the remaining side is 160-2000 = -1840 cm.\n#### -1840",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter (which involves addition of the sides) and the area (which typically involves multiplying length and width, although for triangles the formula is different, involving a half of base times height). The question requires that the values of two sides be added—since it’s a linear measure of perimeter—resulting in 40+50=90 cm in the original solution. By changing the addition to multiplication (40*50=2000 cm), we make an error reflecting confusion between linear and area measures. This affects the subsequent step 2 (the calculation for the remaining side), changing the correct subtraction from 160-90=70 cm to an incorrect subtraction 160-2000=-1840 cm. Note that while the transformed solution contains the error in step 1, the language description remains unchanged. It is a single error in confusing the formula type while the concept of subtraction in step 2 is applied correctly, but with incorrect values.",

        "question": "A school needs to paint the classroom, which is 9 meters long, 8 meters wide, and 3 meters high. The classroom has 4 windows, 2 blackboards, and 2 doors. The windows are 1m by 1.5m, the blackboards are 6m by 1m, and the doors are 2m by 1m. It is known that the paint fee is $4.80 per square meter. How much does it cost to paint a classroom?",
        "original_solution": "Because the floor does not require painting, the total surface area of the classroom excluding the floor, is 9 * 8+8 * 3 * 2+9 * 3 * 2=174 square meters.\nOne window has an area of 1 * 1.5=1.5 square meters.\nFour windows have an area of 4 * 1.5=6 square meters.\nOne blackboard has an area of 6 * 1=6 square meters.\nTwo blackboards have an area of 2 * 6=12 square meters.\nOne door has an area of 2 * 1=2 square meters.\nTwo doors have an area of 2 * 2=4 square meters.\nAnd the area that needs to be painted is 174-6-12-4=152 square meters.\nBecause the paint fee of $4.80 is required per square meter, painting a classroom costs 152 * 4.8=$729.6.\n#### 729.6",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the total surface area of the walls with incorrectly summing the lengths of the classroom, which is equivalent to calculating the perimeter of the floor. The correct calculation for the total surface area of the walls is based on the formula 2*(length*height + width*height), resulting in 9 * 8 + 8 * 3 * 2 + 9 * 3 * 2 = 174 square meters in the original_solution becoming 9 + 8 + 8 + 3 + 3 + 9 + 3 = 43 square meters in the transformed_solution. This error affects the subsequent related steps, specifically step 7, changing from 174 - 6 - 12 - 4 = 152 to 43 - 6 - 12 - 4 = 21. Note that the language description of step 1 < Because the floor does not require painting, the total surface area of the classroom excluding the floor, is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. Only step 1 is modified to introduce the error, while other calculations in the solution, including finding the areas of windows, blackboards, and doors, follow the original correct method.",

        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 1. The operands and operators of the formula in step 1 are completely correct, but only the result is incorrectly calculated as 43 square meters instead of the correct total surface area of the walls. The correct calculation should include the area of all four walls (2 times the length times the height plus 2 times the width times the height) and not simply summing the dimensions of the room. Therefore, it belongs to calculation_error. The subsequent steps that reference the result of step 1 are affected, leading to the incorrect final answer."
