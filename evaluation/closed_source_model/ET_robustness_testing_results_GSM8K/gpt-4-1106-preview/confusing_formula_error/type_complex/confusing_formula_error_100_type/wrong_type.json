        "question": "John decided to start rowing around a square lake.  Each side of the lake is 15 miles.  Jake can row at twice the speed he can swim.  It takes him 20 minutes to swim 1 mile.  How long, in hours, does it take to row the lake?",
        "original_solution": "The perimeter of the lake is 4*15=60 miles\nHe swims at a speed of 60/20=3 mph\nSo he rows at a speed of 3*2=6 mph\nThat means it takes him 60/6=10 hours to row around the lake\n#### 10",

        "transformed_solution": "The area of the lake is 15*15=225 miles\nHe swims at a speed of 60/20=3 mph\nSo he rows at a speed of 3*2=6 mph\nThat means it takes him 225/6=37.5 hours to row around the lake\n#### 37.5",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and area of the square. The question requires that the perimeter of the square to be solved be equal to the side length multiplied by 4, rather than the side length multiplied by itself, which is equivalent to the area of the square, resulting in 4*15=60 in the original_solution becoming 15*15=225 in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 4, changing from 60/6=10 hours to 225/6=37.5 hours to row around the lake. Note that the language description of step 1 < The perimeter of the lake is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that only step 1 mistakenly uses the formula for square area, while the other calculation processes related to the speed and time are still correct in the transformed_solution.",

The windows are 1m by 1.5m, the blackboards are 6m by 1m, and the doors are 2m by 1m. It is known that the paint fee is $4.80 per square meter. How much does it cost to paint a classroom?",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the total surface area of the walls with incorrectly summing the lengths of the classroom, which is equivalent to calculating the perimeter of the floor. The correct calculation for the total surface area of the walls is based on the formula 2*(length*height + width*height), resulting in 9 * 8 + 8 * 3 * 2 + 9 * 3 * 2 = 174 square meters in the original_solution becoming 9 + 8 + 8 + 3 + 3 + 9 + 3 = 43 square meters in the transformed_solution. This error affects the subsequent related steps, specifically step 7, changing from 174 - 6 - 12 - 4 = 152 to 43 - 6 - 12 - 4 = 21.

The correct method is to calculate the area of each wall and then subtract the areas of the windows, blackboards, and doors. This error affects all subsequent steps that depend on the total area to be painted."
