The question requires that the lengths of sides be added, not multiplied, so the original step adding 40+50=90 cm is replaced by 40*50=2000 cm in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 2, changing from 160-90=70 cm to 160-2000=-1840 cm. Note that the language description of step 1 < To get the perimeter, you add all the sides of the triangles > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that only step 1 introduces a confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this case, step 1 mistakenly uses a formula that would calculate area (if applicable) instead of perimeter, while the other calculation processes are still correct.",

The question requires that the values of two sides be added—since it’s a linear measure of perimeter—resulting in 40+50=90 cm in the original solution. By changing the addition to multiplication (40*50=2000 cm), we make an error reflecting confusion between linear and area measures.
