        "explanation": "In this transformed solution, an incorrect unit conversion is made in step 1, which assumes that 1 hour has 50 minutes instead of the correct 60 minutes. This results in the calculation of driving time changing from 12 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 720 minutes in the original solution to 12 hours * 50 minutes per hour = 600 minutes in the transformed solution. Subsequent related steps concerning the total time taken, including rest stops and refueling, are all correctly calculated based on this initial error, leading to a different final answer of 695 minutes as compared to the original answer of 815 minutes. The error is limited to the initial unit conversion, subsequent calculations that hinge on this error are correct, which aligns with the requirement for a single error change.",
