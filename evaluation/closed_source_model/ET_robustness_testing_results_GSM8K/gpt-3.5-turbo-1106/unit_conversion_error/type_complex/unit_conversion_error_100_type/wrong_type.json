        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 12 inches is wrongly equal to 1 yard instead of 1 foot, resulting in 12*1=12 inches=1 foot in the original_solution becoming 12*1=12 inches=1 yard in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 2 and 3. Step 2 changes from 4*1=4 feet to 4*1=4 yards. Step 3 changes from 10*4=40 feet to 10*4=40 yards (noting there are 3 feet in a yard, the actual transformation is 10*4*3 = 120 feet). It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, so the other computation steps are still correct.",

        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, an incorrect unit conversion is made in step 1, where an hour is wrongly considered equal to 50 minutes instead of the correct 60 minutes. As a result, the total time Minnie has to fill with four-minute songs is calculated as 50 - 48 = 2 minutes instead of 60 - 48 = 12 minutes. This error impacts step 4, changing the calculation of the number of four-minute songs needed from 12 / 4 = 3 to 2 / 4 = 0.5. The transformed answer of 0.5 is incorrect because it does not accurately reflect the number of four-minute songs needed to complete a one-hour playlist.
