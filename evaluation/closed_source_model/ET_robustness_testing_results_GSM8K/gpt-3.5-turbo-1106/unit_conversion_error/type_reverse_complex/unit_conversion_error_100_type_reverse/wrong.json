        "question": "Luke is planning a trip to London and wants to see how long it will take him to travel there. He decides that he will take a bus to the town center, walk for 15 minutes to the train center, wait twice this long for the train to arrive, and then take the 6-hour train ride to London. If Luke’s entire trip takes him 8 hours, how many minutes does his bus ride take?",
        "original_solution": "Removing the time of the train ride from the journey shows that his trip to get on the train took him 8 hours – 6 hours = 2 hours.\nConverting this time into minutes shows that getting to the train took 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.\nWaiting for the train to arrive took twice as long as his walk, so 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes.\nThis means that his bus ride must have taken 120 minutes – 30 minutes - 15 minutes = 75 minutes.\n#### 75",

        "explanation": "In step 2 of the original_solution, an incorrect unit conversion was introduced by changing the number of minutes in an hour from 60 to 50. Therefore, the original 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes is transformed to 2 hours * 50 minutes/hour = 100 minutes. This affected the subsequent related step 4, changing 120 minutes – 30 minutes - 15 minutes = 75 minutes to the incorrect 100 minutes – 30 minutes - 15 minutes = 55 minutes. The transformed_answer is calculated based on this incorrect unit conversion, giving a result of 55 minutes for the bus ride instead of the correct 75 minutes.",
