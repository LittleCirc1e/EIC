It should be noted that step 1 in the transformed_solution <Teddy did 1/2 * 500 pieces = 250 pieces.> should be the same as the step 1 in the original_solution <Teddy did 1/2 * 500 pieces = 250 pieces.> and calculates its result 250 correctly.

        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 erroneously references the result 550 of step 2 instead of 500, which only results in an error in one operand in the formula, therefore it belongs to referencing_previous_step_value_error. Its subsequent step 3 references the result of step 2, resulting in the incorrect final answer."

        "question": "Nick is choosing between two jobs. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, and is in a state with a 20% total tax rate. Job B pays $42,000 a year and is in a state that charges $6,000 in property tax and a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax. How much more money will Nick make at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job?",
        "original_solution": "First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $30,000\nNext, calculate the amount of taxes Nick pays at Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: .2 * $30,000 = $6,000\nNow subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000\nNow subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000\nNow multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $3,600\nNow subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400\nNow subtract the net income from the lower-paying job (A) from the net income from the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400\n#### 8400",

The error is introduced only in step 7 where the reference to Job A's net income is incorrect, but all other calculations still use the correct figures. This still allows the transformation to introduce a single error while keeping the rest of the calculations accurate.
