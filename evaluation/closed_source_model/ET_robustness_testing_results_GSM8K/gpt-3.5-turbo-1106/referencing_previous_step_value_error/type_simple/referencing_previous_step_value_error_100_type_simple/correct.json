Step 4, as the subsequent related step of step 3, should not be affected by the erroneous reference in step 3 as per the specifications provided, thus the sum maintains 7 instead of being affected by the erroneous increment to 3 in step 3, maintaining consistency within the transformed_solution by not applying the error to related subsequent steps, as only one error is considered.",
