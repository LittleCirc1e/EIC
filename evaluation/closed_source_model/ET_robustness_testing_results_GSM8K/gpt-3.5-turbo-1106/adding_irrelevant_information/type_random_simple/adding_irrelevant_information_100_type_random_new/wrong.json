        "question": "Kat decides she wants to start a boxing career. She gets a gym membership and spends 1 hour in the gym 3 times a week doing strength training. She also trained at the boxing gym 4 times a week for 1.5 hours. How many hours a week does she train?",
        "original_solution": "She strength trains 3*1=3 hours a week\nShe does boxing training 4*1.5=6 hours a week\nSo she trains a total of 3+6=9 hours a week\n#### 9",
        "original_answer": 9.0,
        "transformed_solution": "She strength trains 3*1=3 hours a week\nBecause Kat also spends an additional 0.5 hours on stretching after each strength training, her total strength training time is 3+(3*0.5)=4.5 hours a week\nShe does boxing training 4*1.5=6 hours a week\nSo she trains a total of 4.5+6=10.5 hours a week\n#### 10.5",

        "explanation": "Step 2 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <Because Kat also spends an additional 0.5 hours on stretching after each strength training>, changing the calculation from 3 hours a week to 4.5 hours a week. The statement has been modified to include this additional half an hour per strength training session, which affects her total weekly training hours in step 4, changing from a total of 3+6=9 hours a week to 4.5+6=10.5 hours a week. It should be noted that we should only consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct.",

        "type_explanation": "The solution is correct because the calculations for the total strength training time and boxing training time are accurate, and the final answer is correctly calculated as 10.5 hours a week."
