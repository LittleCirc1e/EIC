        "question": "On Tuesday, 12,000 ice cream cones were sold. On Wednesday, the number of ice cream cones sold was double the amount sold on Tuesday. How many ice cream cones have been sold in total?",
        "original_solution": "12,000 * 2 = 24,000 ice cream cones were sold on Wednesday.\n12,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 ice cream cones have been sold in total.\n#### 36,000",
        "original_answer": 36000,
        "transformed_solution": "12,000 * 2 = 24,000 ice cream cones were sold on Wednesday.\nOn Thursday, an additional 5,000 ice cream cones were sold due to a promotion.\n12,000 + 24,000 + 5,000 = 41,000 ice cream cones have been sold in total.\n#### 41,000",

        "wrong_type": "adding_irrelevant_information",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 2 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <On Thursday, an additional 5,000 ice cream cones were sold due to a promotion>, resulting in step 2 changing from 12,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 in the original_solution to 12,000 + 24,000 + 5,000 = 41,000 in the transformed_solution. This step incorrectly assumes a third day of sales occurs even though the question only asks about Tuesday and Wednesday.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_type": "none",
        "type_explanation": "The solution correctly follows the given information and uses the appropriate operations to calculate the total number of ice cream cones sold."
