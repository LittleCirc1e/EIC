        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates the total spent on everything but cookies as $11 instead of $13 in step 4, which affects the subsequent calculation of the money spent on cookies in step 5. The modified formula in step 5 becomes 25 - 11 = 14 instead of 25 - 13 = 12. Step 6 and step 7 remain unaffected as they do not rely on the result of step 4 or step 5. As a result, the error is confined to step 4's calculation and its immediate consequence on step 5, leaving all other steps and their calculations as correct. In step 7, the number of boxes of cookies is inaccurately calculated based on the mistaken $14 value, yielding 14 / 6 = 2.33 boxes of cookies.",
