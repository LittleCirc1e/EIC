The original step is '8722 + 178 = 8900', and the transformed solution alters the outcome to '8722 + 188 = 8910'.

        "explanation": "In this case, the calculation 2 x 50 in step 2 is intentionally altered to equal 120 instead of the correct 100. As this is the step that contains the single introduced error, the subsequent step 3 uses the result of this incorrect calculation. Consequently, step 3 changes from the correct 150 + 100 = 250 to the incorrect 150 + 120 = 270. It is important to note that any step prior to the error and unrelated steps remain correct, only the steps that depend on the incorrect calculation inherit the error while still being calculated correctly themselves.",
