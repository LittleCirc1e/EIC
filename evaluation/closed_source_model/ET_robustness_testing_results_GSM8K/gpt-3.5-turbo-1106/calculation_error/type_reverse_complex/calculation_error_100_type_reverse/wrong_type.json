        "question": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2% today. The Dow ended the day at 8,722. What was the Dow in the morning before the markets opened?",
        "original_solution": "Today the Dow was down 8722 / 98*2 = 178.\nSo it started at 8722 + 178 = 8900.\n#### 8900",
        "original_answer": 8900.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Today the Dow was down 8722 / 98*2 = 188.\nSo it started at 8722 + 188 = 8910.\n#### 8910",

        "explanation": "The transformed_solution shows an intentional wrong calculation of the first step: '8722 / 98*2 = 188' instead of the correct '8722 / 98*2 = 178'. The mistake in the first step carries over to the second step '8722 + 188 = 8910' to maintain the inherited error. The subsequent step is affected by using the erroneous result of 188; however, this step is still calculated correctly based on the new wrong input. The original step is '8722 + 178 = 8900', and the transformed solution alters the outcome to '8722 + 188 = 8910'. The transformed answer is therefore 8910, which is different from the original answer of 8900. This simulates a single miscalculation without changing any operands or operators in the formula.",

Step 1 performs an incorrect unit conversion and mistakenly assumes that 2% of the Dow is 98 instead of 0.98, which only results in an error in one operand in the formula, thus it belongs to unit_conversion_error. Step 2, as the subsequent step of step 1, references the erroneous result of step 1, resulting in the incorrect final answer."

        "original_solution": "If Ambika has four birthday candles, and Aniyah has 6 times as many birthday candles as Ambika, then Aniyah has 4*6 = 24 candles. \nWhen they put together the candles, the total number becomes 24+4 = 28 candles.\nWhen they divide the candles and share them equally, each person gets 28/2 = 14 birthday candles.\n#### 14",

        "explanation": "The transformation process includes a wrong calculation in step 2 where the sum is mistakenly changed from \"24+4 = 28 candles\" to an incorrect \"24+4 = 20 candles\". This directly affects the outcome in step 3, where the incorrect total of 20 candles is divided between the two people instead of the correct total of 28 candles. The result of this miscalculation is that each person is incorrectly calculated to get \"20/2 = 10 birthday candles\" instead of the correct answer of \"14 birthday candles\". This exemplifies a single step calculation error that propagates to subsequent steps dependent on the outcome of the miscalculated step.",
