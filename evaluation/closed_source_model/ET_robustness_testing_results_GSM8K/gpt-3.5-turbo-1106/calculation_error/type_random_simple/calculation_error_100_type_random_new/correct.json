        "question": "Valerie needs to put stamps on the envelopes she is about to mail. She has thank you cards for each of her grandmother, uncle and aunt for the birthday presents they sent. She also has to pay the water bill and the electric bill separately. She wants to send three more mail-in rebates than she does bills and she has twice as many job applications as rebates to mail. How many stamps does she need if everything needs 1 stamp except the electric bill, which needs 2?",
        "original_solution": "Valerie has to send a thank you card to each of 3 people, so she has 3 * 1 = 3 thank you cards to mail.\nShe has 2 bills to mail.\nShe has 3 more rebates than bills, so 3 + 2 = 5 mail-in rebates to mail.\nShe has twice as many job applications as rebates, so she has 2 * 5 = 10 applications to mail.\nShe has 3 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 20 pieces of mail to send.\nThe electric bill needs an extra stamp, so she needs 20 + 1 = 21 stamps.\n#### 21",

        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, the calculation for the number of extra stamps needed for the electric bill has been changed from 20 + 1 = 21 stamps to 20 + 2 = 22 stamps in step 5. This is the first and only modification step, resulting in the remaining steps staying the same. Since the postal requirements for the electric bill have not changed, inserting the error at this final juncture ensures that previous calculations remain unaltered and only the affected step is changed, resulting in a different transformed_answer compared to the original_answer.",

        "type_explanation": "The error occurred in the calculation of the total number of stamps needed. The correct total should be 20, not 22, as the electric bill only needs 1 extra stamp, not 2."

        "explanation": "This example changes the calculation of interest in step 1 by wrongly calculating it as 0.1*1200=$100 instead of 0.1*1200=$120. This change goes on to impact step 2, which relies on the result of step 1 for its calculation. So, instead of the correct sum of 1200+120=$1320, after the change it is calculated as 1200+100=$1300. All other elements not reliant on step 1 remain unaffected, and the error is propagated to the sum in step 2, leading to a different total repayment amount of $1300.",

        "pred_wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "type_explanation": "The error is a calculation error because the final calculation of 1200+100=1300 is incorrect. The correct total amount Jack needs to pay back should be 1200+120=1320."
