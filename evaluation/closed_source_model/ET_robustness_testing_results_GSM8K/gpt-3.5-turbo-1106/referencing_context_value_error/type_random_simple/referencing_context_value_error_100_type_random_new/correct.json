        "original_solution": "First find the total time Janet spends looking for her key and complaining each day: 8 minutes/day + 3 minutes/day = 11 minutes/day\nThen multiply that number by the number of days in a week to find the weekly time spent: 11 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 77 minutes\n#### 77",
        "original_answer": 77.0,
        "transformed_solution": "First find the total time Janet spends looking for her key and complaining each day: 6 minutes/day + 3 minutes/day = 9 minutes/day\nThen multiply that number by the number of days in a week to find the weekly time spent: 9 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 63 minutes\n#### 63",

        "explanation": "Step 1 references 8 in the question as 6 wrongly, and calculates 6+3=9 instead of 8+3=11. Its subsequent related step will be affected, calculating 9*7=63 instead of 11*7=77 in step 2.",

        "type_explanation": "The error is in referencing the number in the [Question]. The solution incorrectly states that Janet spends 6 minutes looking for her keys each day, when the correct number is 8 minutes. This error in referencing the context value leads to the final wrong result."
