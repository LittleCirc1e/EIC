Therefore, after deleting step 1, step 3 in the new solution should reference the result of step 2 directly and ignore the information about the ukuleles.

After deleting it, step 2 should now reference the number of packages directly, but instead of using the correct total calculated earlier (50), it incorrectly assumes that each package has a quantity of 1 car (which is the largest number in the question referenced in step 1). As a result, this changes the operation from 50 x 1/5 to 10 x 1/5, which results in an incorrect calculation of the cars given to a nephew (2 instead of 10). Then, the next steps that depended on step 2 are also changed to maintain a logical (but incorrect) flow, adjusting the number of cars given away to 4 and finally concluding that Tom has 6 cars left. It is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 2 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing an incorrect number in the transformed_solution, thus the wrong_step is 1.",

He knows that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult. If there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?",
        "original_solution": "Half of 10 pounds is 10/2=5 pounds.\nTo feed 20 dinosaur adults, he will need 20*10=200 pounds of potato salad.\nTo feed 5 dinosaur children, he will need 5*5=25 pounds of potato salad.\nIn total, he will need to bring 200+25=225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.\n#### 225",

        "explanation": "The first step referencing the calculation for the child dinosaur's portion has been removed. In the original_solution, step 1 calculates the child dinosaur's portion as half of the adult's 10 lbs, which is 5 lbs. As this step has been deleted, the transformed_solution should now directly use the adult's portion for calculating the child dinosaur's portion; however, to ensure the transformed_answer differs from the original_answer, we mistakenly multiply the number of child dinosaurs by the full adult portion (10 lbs) instead of the correct half portion (5 lbs). Therefore, we've changed step 2 to multiply the number of child dinosaurs by the full portion: '5*10=50 pounds of potato salad.' Since subsequent related steps rely on the previous step's result, step 3 also changes and adds this error into the total calculation, changing from '200+25=225 pounds of potato salad' to '200+50=250 pounds of potato salad.' The wrong_step is 2 because that is the first step where the incorrect number from the deleted step is referenced.",

        "explanation": "This example removes intermediate step 3 about Phil collecting 1 coin every third month. This step references the result 4 from the calculation 12/3. Step 4 in the original_solution references the result from this deleted step 3. Therefore, after deleting step 3, step 4 should not include the 4 coins from step 3. The formula changes from 100+36+4 coins to 100+36 coins, which results in 136 coins before the loss. Subsequent steps 5 and 6 are about losing a quarter of the coins and hence will be modified based on the new total before the loss (136 instead of 140). So, step 5 changes from 140/4=35 coins to 136/4=34 coins, and step 6 changes from 140-35=105 coins to 136-34=102 coins. Step 2 in the transformed_solution references the incorrect total number of coins after the deletion of step 3, serving as the first step referencing an incorrect number.
