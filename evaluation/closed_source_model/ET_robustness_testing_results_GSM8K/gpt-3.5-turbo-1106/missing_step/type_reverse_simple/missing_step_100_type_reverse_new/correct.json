        "question": "Daisy is a poodle puppy who loves to play with her dog toys. She often loses them in various ways, and her owner needs to replace them. On Monday, Daisy played with 5 dog toys. On Tuesday, Daisy had 3 dog toys left after losing some, and her owner went to the store and got her 3 more. On Wednesday, all of Daisy's old and new dog toys were missing, so her owner went to the store and bought her 5 more. If Daisy's owner found all the lost dog toys, including the new dog toys, how many dog toys would Daisy have now?",
        "original_solution": "Daisy originally had 5 dog toys on Monday + 3 more her owner bought her on Tuesday = 8 dog toys.\nOn Wednesday Daisy's owner bought her 5 more dog toys + 8 old ones = 13 total dog toys if none were lost.\n#### 13",
        "original_answer": 13.0,
        "transformed_solution": "On Wednesday Daisy's owner bought her 5 more dog toys + 5 old ones = 10 total dog toys if none were lost.\n#### 10",
        "transformed_answer": 10.0,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "missing_step",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Removing step 1 entirely which originally added the 5 original toys to the 3 new toys bought on Tuesday, we need to directly add the new toys bought on Wednesday to the total original toys mentioned in the question which is 5. This makes the calculation now 5 (original toys) + 5 (new toys on Wednesday) instead of 8 (from previous step 1) + 5 (new toys on Wednesday). Subsequently, subsequent steps that would have referenced the 8 now reference the 5. It results in a new total of 5+5=10 dog toys if none were lost, which is different from the original answer, and complies with the requirement that the transformed_solution should have one less step compared to the original_solution. The first transformed step that refers to the error is the new step 1, which in this case is the first and only step.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_type": "missing_step",
        "type_explanation": "The solution is incorrect because it fails to account for the fact that some of the new and old dog toys were lost, so the total number of dog toys Daisy would have now cannot be determined without considering the lost toys."

        "question": "Marcus has received a commission for as many paintings as possible. Marcus plans out his drawings so that his client can receive some of the paintings as soon as possible but it is still going to take a long time. On the first day, he paints 2 paintings. He then paints every day and each day, he paints twice as many paintings as he painted the day before. If he paints for 5 days, how many paintings will he have painted in total?",
        "original_solution": "If Marcus creates 2 paintings on the first day, then he can paint 2 paintings * 2 = 4 paintings on the 2nd day.\nSo he paints 4 paintings * 2 = 8 paintings on the 3rd day.\nHe then paints 8 paintings * 2 = 16 paintings on the 4th day.\nAnd finally paints 16 paintings * 2 = 32 paintings on the 5th day.\nMarcus therefore has painted a total of 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 paintings.\n#### 62",
        "original_answer": 62.0,
        "transformed_solution": "So Marcus paints 2 paintings * 2 = 4 paintings on the 2nd day.\nHe then paints 4 paintings * 2 = 8 paintings on the 3rd day.\nHe then paints 8 paintings * 2 = 16 paintings on the 4th day.\nAnd finally paints 16 paintings * 2 = 32 paintings on the 5th day.\nMarcus therefore has painted a total of 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 paintings.\n#### 124",

        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this transformation, the first step has been removed. Since the first step is missing, we need to adjust the final summation step (original Step 5) to compensate for this removal. The original solution went through 5 steps to show the progression of paintings from Day 1 to Day 5. By removing the first day's 2 paintings and not adjusting the final sum to account for this absence, it results in an error in calculation. Specifically, the final sum should still be 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 as in the original solution. However, in the transformed step, the summation incorrectly doubles the calculated total to 124, which becomes the transformed_answer. Therefore, the wrong_step is the last remaining one (number 5 in the sequence of steps that have not been deleted), as it improperly adjusts for the missing step and incorrectly doubles the total count, showing a calculation error.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "type_explanation": "The error is a calculation error because the final calculation of the total number of paintings is incorrect. The correct total should be 62, not 124."
