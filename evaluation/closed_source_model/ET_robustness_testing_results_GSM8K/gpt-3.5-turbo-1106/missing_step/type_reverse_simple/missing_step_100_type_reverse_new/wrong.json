        "explanation": "The first step referencing the calculation for the child dinosaur's portion has been removed. In the original_solution, step 1 calculates the child dinosaur's portion as half of the adult's 10 lbs, which is 5 lbs. As this step has been deleted, the transformed_solution should now directly use the adult's portion for calculating the child dinosaur's portion; however, to ensure the transformed_answer differs from the original_answer, we mistakenly multiply the number of child dinosaurs by the full adult portion (10 lbs) instead of the correct half portion (5 lbs). Therefore, we've changed step 2 to multiply the number of child dinosaurs by the full portion: '5*10=50 pounds of potato salad.' Since subsequent related steps rely on the previous step's result, step 3 also changes and adds this error into the total calculation, changing from '200+25=225 pounds of potato salad' to '200+50=250 pounds of potato salad.' The wrong_step is 2 because that is the first step where the incorrect number from the deleted step is referenced.",

        "question": "Phil has a coin collection he likes to add to. He started with 50 state quarters his parents gave him. Over the next year he doubled this. The following year he collected 3 each month. The year after that he collected 1 every third month. The year after that he lost a quarter of them when he misplaced his collection. How many did he have left after losing some?",
        "original_solution": "Phil started with 50, and doubled this amount the next year for 50*2=100 coins\nPhil then collected 3 per month the following year, and since there are 12 months in a year that was 3*12=36 coins added\nPhil then collected 1 every third month, and since there are 12 months that means he collected one every 12/3=4 months, for 4 coins added\nBefore he lost a quarter of his coins, Phil had 100+36+4 coins, or 140 coins in total.\nLosing a quarter of 140 coins means Phill lost 140/4=35 coins\nThat means Phil had 140-35= 105 coins remaining\n#### 105",

        "explanation": "This example removes intermediate step 3 about Phil collecting 1 coin every third month. This step references the result 4 from the calculation 12/3. Step 4 in the original_solution references the result from this deleted step 3. Therefore, after deleting step 3, step 4 should not include the 4 coins from step 3. The formula changes from 100+36+4 coins to 100+36 coins, which results in 136 coins before the loss. Subsequent steps 5 and 6 are about losing a quarter of the coins and hence will be modified based on the new total before the loss (136 instead of 140). So, step 5 changes from 140/4=35 coins to 136/4=34 coins, and step 6 changes from 140-35=105 coins to 136-34=102 coins. Step 2 in the transformed_solution references the incorrect total number of coins after the deletion of step 3, serving as the first step referencing an incorrect number. The wrong_step is 2 as this is where the error first appears.",
