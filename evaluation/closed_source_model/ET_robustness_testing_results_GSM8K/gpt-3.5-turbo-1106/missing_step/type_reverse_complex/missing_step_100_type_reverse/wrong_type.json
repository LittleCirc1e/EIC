With the deletion of this step, step 2 from the original solution, which is now step 1 in the transformed solution, needs to directly reference the numbers from the question, which were 200 and 300. The transformed solution now incorrectly assumes that Eliana walked these steps twice on the second day, leading to a doubling of the 300 steps. The wrong step in the transformed solution is the new step 1, which took the place of step 2 in the original solution, because it refers to the incorrect number when calculating the steps for the second day.",

This incorrect modification affects the calculation of yellow pebbles resulting in a different answer, as the division would then include the blue pebbles in the count.
