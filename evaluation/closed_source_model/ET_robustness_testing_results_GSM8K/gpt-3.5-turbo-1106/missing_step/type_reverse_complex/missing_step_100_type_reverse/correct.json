In the original_solution, step 1 calculates the cost of the plates, which is referenced in step 2. In the transformed_solution, step 1 was eliminated, making the first step (which also happens to be step 2 in the original_solution) directly reference the cost of the silverware from the question. Because step 1 often references a number in the question, the incorrect number used in the transformed solution (the original cost of just the silverware) is also from the question. Hence, the formula changed from 10+20=$30 to 20+20=$40. The wrong_step is 1 because it is the first transformed step that incorrectly calculates the total cost by failing to account for the correct cost of the dinner plates.",

Suppose Kim got 6 correct answers in the easy; 2 correct answers in the average; and 4 correct answers in the difficult round, what are her total points in the contest?",
        "original_solution": "Kim got 6 points/round x 2 round = 12 points in the easy round.\nShe got 2 points/round x 3 rounds = 6 points in the average round.\nShe got 4 points/round x 5 rounds = 20 points in the difficult round.\nSo her total points is 12 points + 6 points + 20 points = 38 points.\n#### 38",

So after deleting step 1, step 4 should change and reference the number 6 (number of correct answers in the easy round) directly from the question since it is the largest number in this case. This causes the formula to change from 12 points + 6 points + 20 points = 38 points to 6*2 points + 6 points + 20 points = 32 points, with the understanding that the easy round's score is calculated directly in the final summation. Since the deletion of step 1 affects the final summation, it is considered the first and only mistake in the transformed solution, so the wrong_step is 1.",

        "question": "Marcus has received a commission for as many paintings as possible.

He then paints every day and each day, he paints twice as many paintings as he painted the day before. If he paints for 5 days, how many paintings will he have painted in total?",

Since the first step is missing, we need to adjust the final summation step (original Step 5) to compensate for this removal. The original solution went through 5 steps to show the progression of paintings from Day 1 to Day 5. By removing the first day's 2 paintings and not adjusting the final sum to account for this absence, it results in an error in calculation. Specifically, the final sum should still be 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 as in the original solution. However, in the transformed step, the summation incorrectly doubles the calculated total to 124, which becomes the transformed_answer. Therefore, the wrong_step is the last remaining one (number 5 in the sequence of steps that have not been deleted), as it improperly adjusts for the missing step and incorrectly doubles the total count, showing a calculation error.",
