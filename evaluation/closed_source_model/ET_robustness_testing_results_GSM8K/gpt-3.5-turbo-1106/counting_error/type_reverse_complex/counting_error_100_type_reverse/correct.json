        "question": "If a vehicle is driven 12 miles on Monday, 18 miles on Tuesday, and 21 miles on Wednesday. What is the average distance traveled per day?",
        "original_solution": "The total distance covered from Monday to Wednesday is 12 + 18 + 21 = 51 miles.\nSo the average distance traveled per day is 51/3 = 17 miles.\n#### 17",
        "original_answer": 17.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total distance covered from Monday to Wednesday is 12 + 18 + 21 = 51 miles.\nThe average distance traveled per day is counted as 51/2 = 25.5 miles because Wednesday is mistakenly excluded.\n#### 25.5",

        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 erroneously assumes the total distance covered should be divided by 2 days instead of 3, which means Wednesday is mistakenly excluded. Hence the average 51/3=17 changes to 51/2=25.5. The error is isolated to the counting of the number of days, and the previous step regarding the calculation of total distance remains unaffected.",

        "pred_wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 mistakenly excludes the distance traveled on Wednesday, resulting in an error in the counting process, so it belongs to counting_error. Step 3, as the subsequent step of step 2, references the wrong result of step 2, resulting in the incorrect final answer."

        "question": "It’s exam season and Tristan has several exams to prepare for. On Monday, he studies for 4 hours then studies for twice this long on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday he studies for 3 hours each day. He wants to study for a total of 25 hours over the week and divides the remaining amount of study time evenly between Saturday and Sunday. How many hours does Tristan spend studying on Saturday?",
        "original_solution": "On Tuesday, Tristan studies twice as long as he did on Monday and this amounts to 4 hours * 2 = 8 hours.\nSo in the first 5 days of the week, he studies for a total of 4 hours Monday + 8 hours Tuesday + 3 hours Wednesday + 3 hours Thursday + 3 hours Friday = 21 hours.\nHe therefore has 25 planned hours – 21 used hours = 4 hours left to study.\nAs he splits his time evenly over 2 days, he spends 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours studying on Saturday.\n#### 2",

These errors are carried through to steps 3 and 4, impacting the total for the 5 days instead of 6 days and changing the subtraction to account for intake on Wednesday from 60 - 51 = 9 liters to 60 - 34 = 26 liters.
