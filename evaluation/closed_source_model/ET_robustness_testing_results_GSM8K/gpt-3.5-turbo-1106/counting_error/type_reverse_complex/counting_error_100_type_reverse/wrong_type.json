        "question": "Gumball was counting his water intake for the previous week. He checked his list and saw that he had drank 60 liters of water for the week. He drank nine liters of water on Monday, Thursday and Saturday and 8 liters of water on Tuesday, Friday and Sunday. Unfortunately, no data was input on Wednesday. How many liters of water did he drink on Wednesday?",
        "original_solution": "Gumball's total water intake on Monday, Thursday, and Saturday is 9 x 3 = 27 liters.\nAnd his total water intake on Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday is 8 x 3 = 24 liters.\nSo his total water intake for 6 days is 24 + 27 = 51 liters.\nTherefore Gumball's water intake on Wednesday is 60 - 51 = 9 liters.\n#### 9",
        "original_answer": 9.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Gumball's total water intake on Monday, Thursday, and Saturday is 9 x 2 = 18 liters.\nAnd his total water intake on Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday is 8 x 3 = 24 liters.\nSo his total water intake for 5 days is 24 + 18 = 42 liters.\nTherefore Gumball's water intake on Wednesday is 60 - 42 = 18 liters.\n#### 18",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 erroneously counts Monday, Thursday, and Saturday as 2 days instead of 3 days, resulting in 9 x 3 = 27 liters becoming 9 x 2 = 18 liters. This change affected the subsequent related calculations, with the total water intake for only 5 days calculated as 42 liters instead of 6 days for 51 liters, and the intake for Wednesday was incorrectly deduced to be 18 liters instead of 9 liters. The error was confined to the first step, and the subsequent subtraction step was correctly performed based on the erroneous total.",

        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 5. Step 5 mistakenly calculates the total water intake for 5 days as 24 + 18 = 42 liters, which is incorrect. It should be 9 x 3 + 8 x 3 = 51 liters. Therefore, Gumball's water intake on Wednesday is 60 - 51 = 9 liters. Step 5, as the subsequent step of step 4, references the wrong result of step 5, resulting in the incorrect final answer."
