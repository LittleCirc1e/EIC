        "question": "In a week, 450 cars drove through a toll booth. Fifty vehicles went through the toll booth on Monday and the same number of vehicles drove through the toll booth on Tuesday. On each of Wednesday and Thursday, twice the number of cars that passed through the toll booth on Monday went through the toll booth. If, for the remaining of the days of the week, an equal number of vehicles passed through the toll booth, calculate the total number of cars that passed the toll both in each of the remaining days.",
        "original_solution": "There were 50+50 = 100 cars that went through the toll booth on Monday and Tuesday.\nOn Wednesday, the number of cars that went through the toll booth is 2*50 = 100.\nThe exact number of cars passed through the toll booth on Thursday as Wednesday, giving a total of 100+100 = 200 vehicles going through the toll booth in the two days.\nThere were 200+100 = 300 cars that passed through the toll booth from Monday to Thursday.\nIf the total number of cars passed through the toll booth in the week was 450, then 450-300 = 150 vehicles went through the toll booth on the remaining days.\nSince there were an equal number of cars in the toll booth on each of the remaining days, there were 150/3 = 50 cars on each day.\n#### 50",

        "explanation": "In the wrong_step (step 6), the number of remaining days in the week should be 3 (Friday, Saturday, Sunday), but it has been incorrectly assumed to be 2 in the transformed_solution. Therefore, the calculation of 150/3 in the original_solution has been erroneously transformed to 150/2. The division operation is correctly performed, but the number of days (the divisor) is a counting error, resulting in a different transformed_answer.",

How many kilometers did the driver travel during these 5 days?",
        "original_solution": "From Monday to Wednesday, there are 3 * 2 = 6 hours of work.\nDuring this time the driver drove 6 * 12 = 72 kilometers.\nOn Thursday and Friday, there are 2 * 2 = 4 hours of work in total.\nDuring this time the driver drove 4 * 9 = 36 kilometers.\nSo in total, the driver traveled 72 + 36 = 108 kilometers during these five days.\n#### 108",

This error affects both step 3 and the subsequent step 4, which then calculates the distance for Thursday and Friday as 2 * 9 = 18 kilometers instead of 4 * 9 = 36 kilometers. The final step calculates the total distance as 72 + 18 = 90 kilometers instead of the correct 72 + 36 = 108 kilometers.
