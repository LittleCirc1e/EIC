        "pred_wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 3. Step 3 performs an incorrect unit conversion and mistakenly assumes that one foot has 12 inches instead of 1 foot has 12 inches, which only results in an error in one operand in the formula, thus it belongs to unit_conversion_error. Step 4, as the subsequent step of step 3, references the erroneous result of step 3, resulting in the incorrect final answer."

        "question": "John carves a giant marble rectangular prism 8 meters tall with a 2-meter square base. It has a density of 2700 kg per cubic meter. How much does it weigh?",
        "original_solution": "The marble statue has a volume of 2*2*8=32 cubic meters\nSo that means it has a weight of 2700*32=86,400 kg\n#### 86,400",
        "original_answer": 86400.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The marble statue has a volume of 2+2+2+2=8 cubic meters\nSo that means it has a weight of 2700*8=21,600 kg\n#### 21,600",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and volume calculations. The original_solution properly calculates the volume of the rectangular prism by multiplying the side of the square base with itself and then by the height (2*2*8), but the transformed_solution incorrectly treats the calculation as if finding the perimeter of the base (2+2+2+2). By changing the formula from volume to perimeter, the result is an incorrect volume calculation, influencing the subsequent weight calculation in step 2. As a result, the original_solution's correct volume of 32 cubic meters used to find the weight (2700*32) is erroneously transformed to an incorrect volume of 8 cubic meters (2+2+2+2) and the subsequent incorrect weight (2700*8). It's important to note that only step 1 has been modified to introduce the confusing formula error, affecting the related step 2, while no language description has been changed.",

        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 1. Step 1 mistakenly calculates the volume of the rectangular prism as 8 cubic meters instead of 8 cubic meters, resulting in an error in the operand of the formula, so it belongs to counting_error."
