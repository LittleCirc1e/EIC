        "explanation": "Here, in step 1, the calculation of the total surface area has been incorrectly changed to calculate total length around the classroom like a perimeter, which is not the correct approach as it neglects the height and considers only length and width. The appropriate method is to consider length, width, and height to calculate the surface area of the walls. This incorrect transformation results in a different value for the total surface area and consequently the cost of painting the classroom.",

        "question": "Linda is painting her bedroom. Her bedroom has 4 walls, with the room being 20 feet wide by 20 feet long by 8 feet tall. One wall has a 3-foot by 7-foot doorway. A second wall has a 6-foot by 4-foot window. A third wall has a 5-foot by 7-foot doorway to a walk-in-closet. And the fourth wall is completely solid. What is the total area of wall space that Linda will have to paint?",
        "original_solution": "The solid wall is 8 ft. * 20 ft. = 160 sq. ft.\nThe doorway is 3 ft. * 7 ft. = 21 sq. ft.\nThe window is 6 ft. * 4 ft. = 24 sq. ft.\nThe closet door is 5 ft. * 7 ft. = 35 sq. ft.\nThe total area of the doors and windows is 21 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 80 sq. ft.\nThe solid wall is 160 sq. ft., so before the areas of the doors and window are taken into account, the total wall area is 4 * 160 sq. ft. = 640 sq. ft.\nTaking into account the doors and window, the total wall area Linda will have to paint is 640 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 560 sq. ft.\n#### 560",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and area of a rectangle. The question requires that the area of the wall to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by height, rather than the sum of all four sides, which is equivalent to the perimeter, resulting in 8 ft. * 20 ft. = 160 sq. ft. in the original_solution becoming 8 ft. + 20 ft. + 8 ft. + 20 ft. = 56 sq. ft. in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent related step, where the total wall area calculation changes from 4 * 160 sq. ft. = 640 sq. ft. to 4 * 56 sq. ft. = 224 sq. ft., and the final calculation changes from 640 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 560 sq. ft. to 224 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 144 sq. ft. Note that the language description of step 1 <The solid wall is> in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 1 mistakenly uses the formula of rectangular perimeter, while the original_solution is correct in calculating the areas of the doorway, window, and closet door, and the subtraction process in the final step.",
