        "explanation": "Here, step 1 mistakenly uses the perimeter formula instead of the area formula for Bill’s TV. The question requires finding the area (length multiplied by width), but the step has been modified to calculate the perimeter (sum of all sides), leading to 48 inches * 100 inches = 4800 square inches in the original_solution becoming 48 inches + 48 inches + 100 inches + 100 inches = 296 inches in the transformed_solution. This error changes the values in the subsequent calculation steps, as the subtraction is now incorrect and thus affects the calculation of the weight difference in both ounces and pounds. All other calculation processes are correct, with only step 1 containing the error. The wording of the step remains as <First find the screen area of Bill's TV:>, but the calculation thereafter is altered to fit the error introduced.",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and area of rectangle. The question requires the area of the rectangle to be solved, which is equal to the length multiplied by width. Instead, the transformed solution incorrectly calculates the perimeter by adding all sides, resulting in 2 feet * 4 feet = 8 square feet in the original_solution changing to 2 feet + 4 feet + 2 feet + 4 feet = 12 square feet in the transformed_solution.

Note that the language description of step 1 < First find the area of the painting: > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that only one step of confusing formula error is considered, and the other calculation processes are still correct.

The original_solution properly calculates the volume of the rectangular prism by multiplying the side of the square base with itself and then by the height (2*2*8), but the transformed_solution incorrectly treats the calculation as if finding the perimeter of the base (2+2+2+2). By changing the formula from volume to perimeter, the result is an incorrect volume calculation, influencing the subsequent weight calculation in step 2. As a result, the original_solution's correct volume of 32 cubic meters used to find the weight (2700*32) is erroneously transformed to an incorrect volume of 8 cubic meters (2+2+2+2) and the subsequent incorrect weight (2700*8).
