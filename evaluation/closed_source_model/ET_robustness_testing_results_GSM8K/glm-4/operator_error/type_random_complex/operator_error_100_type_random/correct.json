        "original_solution": "First find how many of the peaches are fresh, which is 250 peaches * 60% = 150 peaches.\nThen, subtract the number Brenda throws away after the fresh count, which is 150 peaches - 15 peaches = 135 peaches.\n#### 135",

        "explanation": "The transformation involves changing the subtraction operation to an addition operation in step 2. Instead of subtracting the 15 small peaches from the fresh peaches, the transformed solution incorrectly adds them, resulting in 150 peaches + 15 peaches = 165 peaches. This results in a wrong total number of peaches. The transformed solution only introduces a single error in the step 2 operation while all remaining calculations and logic are kept correct, which affects the final answer.",
