The result from step 1 affects step 2, thus changing the total from 2+5=7 to 2+6=8. It should be noted that only the operator in step 1 is changed, but the calculation after changing the operator is done correctly.

        "explanation": "This example changes the subtraction in the original solution step 1 to addition, turning '20-6 = 14 inches' into '20+6 = 26 inches'. Subsequently, step 2, which calculates the length of Kate's hair based on the length of Emily's hair, now uses the incorrect figure from step 1 but does the calculation correctly. Thus, '14/2= 7 inches' is transformed into '26/2= 13 inches'. The transformed answer is therefore different from the original answer due to the introduced operator error in step 1.",
