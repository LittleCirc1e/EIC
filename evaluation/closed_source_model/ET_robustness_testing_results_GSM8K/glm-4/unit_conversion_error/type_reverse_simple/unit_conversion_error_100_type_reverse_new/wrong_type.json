        "question": "Jane, Kyla, and Anthony have summer jobs in a resort. Their task is to fold guests' towels. Jane can fold 3 towels in 5 minutes. Kyla can fold 5 towels in 10 minutes, and Anthony can fold 7 towels in 20 minutes. If they all fold towels together, how many towels can they fold in one hour?",
        "original_solution": "There are 1 x 60 minutes = 60 minutes in 1 hour.\nThere are 60/5 = 12 sets of 5 minutes in 1 hour.\nSo, Jane can fold 3 x 12 = 36 towels in an hour.\nThere are 60/10 = 6 sets of 10 minutes in 1 hour.\nSo, Kyla can fold 5 x 6 = 30 towels in an hour.\nThere are 60/20 = 3 sets of 20 minutes in 1 hour.\nSo, Anthony can fold 7 x 3 = 21 towels in an hour.\nTherefore, the 3 of them can fold a total of 36 + 30 + 21 = 87 towels in 1 hour.\n#### 87",

Consequently, the sets of time divisions for Jane, Kyla, and Anthony are recalculated based on a 50-minute hour (steps 2, 4, and 6) instead of 60 minutes, which affects their individual totals (steps 3, 5, and 7) and the final cumulative total (step 8).
