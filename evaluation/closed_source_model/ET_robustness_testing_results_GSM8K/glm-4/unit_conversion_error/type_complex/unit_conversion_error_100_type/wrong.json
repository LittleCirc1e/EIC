        "question": "Jenna is hemming her prom dress. The dress's hem is 3 feet long. Each stitch Jenna makes is 1/4 inch long. If Jenna makes 24 stitches per minute, how many minutes does it take Jenna to hem her dress?",
        "original_solution": "First find how many inches the hem is by multiplying the length in feet by the number of inches per foot: 3 feet * 12 inches/foot = 36 inches\nThen divide the length in inches by the length of each stitch to find how many stitches Jenna makes: 36 inches / .25 inches = 144 stitches\nThen divide the number of stitches by Jenna's stitching rate to find how long it takes her: 144 stitches / 24 stitches/minute = 6 minutes\n#### 6",
        "original_answer": 6.0,
        "transformed_solution": "First find how many inches the hem is by multiplying the length in feet by the number of inches per foot: 3 feet * 10 inches/foot = 30 inches\nThen divide the length in inches by the length of each stitch to find how many stitches Jenna makes: 30 inches / .25 inches = 120 stitches\nThen divide the number of stitches by Jenna's stitching rate to find how long it takes her: 120 stitches / 24 stitches/minute = 5 minutes\n#### 5",

        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 foot is wrongly equal to 10 inches instead of 12 inches, resulting in 3 feet * 12 inches/foot = 36 inches in the original_solution becoming 3 feet * 10 inches/foot = 30 inches in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 2 and 3, which change from 36 inches / .25 inches = 144 stitches to 30 inches / .25 inches = 120 stitches and 144 stitches / 24 stitches/minute = 6 minutes to 120 stitches / 24 stitches/minute = 5 minutes, respectively. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_type": "none",
        "type_explanation": "The solution correctly converts the length of the hem from feet to inches, calculates the total number of stitches required, and then divides that number by the rate of stitches per minute to find the total time taken. All steps are correct and no irrelevant information is added."

        "question": "Every hour past noon shadows from a building stretch an extra 5 feet, starting at zero at noon. How long are the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon in inches?",
        "original_solution": "If the shadows lengthen by 5 feet per hour, this means that in 6 hours the shadows would have lengthened from zero to 5*6=30 feet.\nSince there are 12 inches in every foot, this means the building's shadow would be 30*12= 360 inches in length.\n#### 360",
        "original_answer": 360.0,
        "transformed_solution": "If the shadows lengthen by 5 feet per hour, this means that in 6 hours the shadows would have lengthened from zero to 5*6=30 feet.\nSince there are 10 inches in every foot, this means the building's shadow would be 30*10= 300 inches in length.\n#### 300",

This is the unit conversion error, and the previous calculation step that finds the total feet of shadow after 6 hours remains correct.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_type": "none",
        "type_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the length of the shadow 6 hours past noon by multiplying the rate of change per hour by the number of hours passed. It also correctly converts feet to inches using the conversion factor of 10 inches per foot. Therefore, the solution is correct and does not fall into any of the specified wrong types."
