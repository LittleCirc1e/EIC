The calculation of the number of sequences is correct, but the subsequent calculation in step 6 incorrectly subtracts the total pause time from the total time, which should instead be subtracted from the swimming time. The correct calculation should be the time spent swimming (150 minutes - total pause time) divided by the time to swim 100 meters. The error in this step is a calculation error since the operands and operators are correct, but the result is calculated incorrectly."
