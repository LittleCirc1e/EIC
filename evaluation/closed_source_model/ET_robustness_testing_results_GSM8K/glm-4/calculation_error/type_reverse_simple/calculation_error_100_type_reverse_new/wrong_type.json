        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, the calculation for the number of extra stamps needed for the electric bill has been changed from 20 + 1 = 21 stamps to 20 + 2 = 22 stamps in step 5. This is the first and only modification step, resulting in the remaining steps staying the same. Since the postal requirements for the electric bill have not changed, inserting the error at this final juncture ensures that previous calculations remain unaltered and only the affected step is changed, resulting in a different transformed_answer compared to the original_answer.",

        "pred_wrong_type": "missing_step",
        "type_explanation": "The solution does not account for the fact that the electric bill needs 2 stamps, not 1. It only adds 1 extra stamp for the electric bill instead of the required 2, which is a missing step in the calculation."
