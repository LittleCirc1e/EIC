        "question": "Daisy is a poodle puppy who loves to play with her dog toys. She often loses them in various ways, and her owner needs to replace them. On Monday, Daisy played with 5 dog toys. On Tuesday, Daisy had 3 dog toys left after losing some, and her owner went to the store and got her 3 more. On Wednesday, all of Daisy's old and new dog toys were missing, so her owner went to the store and bought her 5 more. If Daisy's owner found all the lost dog toys, including the new dog toys, how many dog toys would Daisy have now?",
        "original_solution": "Daisy originally had 5 dog toys on Monday + 3 more her owner bought her on Tuesday = 8 dog toys.\nOn Wednesday Daisy's owner bought her 5 more dog toys + 8 old ones = 13 total dog toys if none were lost.\n#### 13",
        "original_answer": 13.0,
        "transformed_solution": "On Wednesday Daisy's owner bought her 5 more dog toys + 5 old ones = 10 total dog toys if none were lost.\n#### 10",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Removing step 1 entirely which originally added the 5 original toys to the 3 new toys bought on Tuesday, we need to directly add the new toys bought on Wednesday to the total original toys mentioned in the question which is 5. This makes the calculation now 5 (original toys) + 5 (new toys on Wednesday) instead of 8 (from previous step 1) + 5 (new toys on Wednesday). Subsequently, subsequent steps that would have referenced the 8 now reference the 5. It results in a new total of 5+5=10 dog toys if none were lost, which is different from the original answer, and complies with the requirement that the transformed_solution should have one less step compared to the original_solution. The first transformed step that refers to the error is the new step 1, which in this case is the first and only step.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_type": "missing_step",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 1. The solution does not account for the dog toys Daisy had after Tuesday, which were 3 old ones + 3 new ones = 6 dog toys. The step that calculates the total number of dog toys after Wednesday is missing the addition of the toys from Tuesday, causing a missing_step error. The final answer only considers the toys from Wednesday and the old toys from before Tuesday, leading to an incorrect final result."

        "question": "Chris wants to hold his breath underwater for 90 straight seconds so he starts training each day. On the first day, he holds it for 10 seconds. On the second day, he holds it for 20 seconds. On the third day, he holds it for 30 seconds. After realizing that he can hold it for ten extra seconds each day, he realizes he can calculate how many days it is until he reaches 90 if he keeps up the same pace. So how many days until he can hold his breath for 90 seconds?",
        "original_solution": "He still has to improve by 60 more seconds because 90 - 30 = 60\nThis will take 6 days because 60 / 10 = 6\n#### 6",

        "explanation": "The first step of the original solution has been removed. Originally, this step calculates the remaining seconds by subtracting 30 (the result of the third day) from 90. After removing this step, the 60 seconds of improvement mentioned in the result no longer has context, and the solution incorrectly assumes that Chris is starting from 0 seconds, which leads to dividing 90 by 10 to recommend 9 days of training. Since the deleted first step referenced the number 30 from the question, the transformed answer should still reflect the additional 60 seconds of improvement needed. However, the error in the transformation directly references 90 instead of the correct context, which is why the wrong_step is 1.",

        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 1. The solution jumps directly to dividing 90 by 10 without accounting for the incremental increase in the number of seconds Chris can hold his breath each day. There is a missing step to calculate the total number of seconds he can hold his breath after each day of training, which should be 10 seconds more than the previous day. This error belongs to missing_step."

The deleted step 1 would normally reference the numbers 5 and 4 from the question. However, since we're deleting the first step and not recalculating the number of species with the new additions, we're incorrectly using the original number of species (5). The subsequent step that originally referenced the result of step 1 now incorrectly references the original number of species (5), leading to the calculation of 5 * 6 = 30 minutes instead of the correct 9 * 6 = 54 minutes.

Since the first step is missing, we need to adjust the final summation step (original Step 5) to compensate for this removal. The original solution went through 5 steps to show the progression of paintings from Day 1 to Day 5. By removing the first day's 2 paintings and not adjusting the final sum to account for this absence, it results in an error in calculation. Specifically, the final sum should still be 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 as in the original solution. However, in the transformed step, the summation incorrectly doubles the calculated total to 124, which becomes the transformed_answer. Therefore, the wrong_step is the last remaining one (number 5 in the sequence of steps that have not been deleted), as it improperly adjusts for the missing step and incorrectly doubles the total count, showing a calculation error.",

After deleting step 1, the second step should change the divisor (which was originally 6) to the largest number that was used in the deleted step 1 (which is 3). This causes the calculation to change from 30/6=$5 to 30/3=$10. The reference to the total number of uses is removed and replaced with the number of uses per week.

The sequence of steps in the transformed_solution erroneously inflated the hair growth, directly affecting the subsequent computations, which are also incorrect but follow from the initial error in step 1.
