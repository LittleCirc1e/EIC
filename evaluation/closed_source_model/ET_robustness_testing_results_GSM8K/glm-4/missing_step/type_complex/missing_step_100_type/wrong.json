        "question": "Johnny is an engineer designing a bridge. The roadway deck for the top of the bridge needs 1600 tons of concrete to construct. The two bridge anchors need equal amounts of concrete, but only one has been built so far, using 700 tons of concrete. Johnny had to calculate how many tons of concrete the supporting pillars underneath the bridge would need, and he found that the total amount of concrete in the entire bridge will be 4800 tons. How much concrete did Johnny find he needs for the supporting pillars?",
        "original_solution": "The bridge anchors will take 700 * 2 = 1400 tons of concrete.\nThe roadway deck and bridge anchors need 1600 + 1400 = 3000 tons of concrete.\nThus, Johnny found the supporting pillars need 4800 - 3000 = 1800 tons of concrete.\n#### 1,800",
        "original_answer": 1800.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The roadway deck and bridge anchors need 1600 + 700 = 2300 tons of concrete.\nThus, Johnny found the supporting pillars need 4800 - 2300 = 2500 tons of concrete.\n#### 2,500",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In the transformation, step 1 from the original_solution has been removed, which originally calculated the total concrete needed for both bridge anchors. The subsequent steps that relied on the result of this deleted step have been modified to reference the concrete of only one anchor (700 tons) from the question. Step 2 now adds together 1600 tons (roadway deck) and 700 tons (one bridge anchor already built) to get 2300 tons, as the deleted step 1 had originally referenced 1400 tons for both bridge anchors. In the transformed_solution, step 2, which referenced 1400 from the deleted step 1, has changed to reference the 700 tons of one anchor, causing the calculation to change from 1600 + 1400 = 3000 to 1600 + 700 = 2300. This causes an error in calculating the total amount of concrete for roadway deck and bridge anchors, and affects step 3, where the total tonnage for the supporting pillars is now calculated as 4800 - 2300 = 2500 tons. The wrong_step in the transformed_solution is 1, as it is the first step that references the incorrect tonnage due to the deletion of the initial step.",

        "type_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the total concrete needed for the roadway deck and one bridge anchor, then subtracts this from the total concrete needed for the entire bridge to find the amount needed for the supporting pillars.

        "question": "Adam had a farm with animals. He had 12 cows and twice as many sheep. He decided to buy 3 pigs for every sheep he had. How many animals were on the farm after the transaction?",
        "original_solution": "Adam had twice as many sheep as the cows, so 2 sheep/cow * 12 cows = 24 sheep.\nFor every sheep, he bought 3 pigs, so he bought 3 pigs/sheep * 24 sheep = 72 pigs.\nIn total on the farm, there were 72 pigs + 24 sheep + 12 cows = 108 animals.\n#### 108",

        "explanation": "Here, the first step has been removed. In the original_solution, step 1 calculates the number of sheep based on the number of cows, and this result is used in step 2 to calculate the number of pigs. After deleting step 1, the number of sheep is missing in the modified solution, and step 2 should change the formula from 3 pigs/sheep * 24 sheep to 3 pigs/sheep * (2 * 12 cows). However, this has been incorrectly omitted, and the calculation of pigs is directly based on the number of sheep from the removed step, resulting in an unaccounted number of sheep in step 2. The subsequent step 3, which originally summed up pigs, sheep, and cows, now incorrectly sums up just pigs and cows, leading to a wrong total count of animals on the farm. It is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 3 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step with the unaccounted number in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 1.",

After deleting original step 2, the new step 2 should be based on step 1's result, so the formula should now reference the 30 dollars directly rather than the result of deleted step 2's 20 dollars. The number 30 dollars also appears in deleted step 2, so we choose 30 as the reference for the new step 2 because it is the larger number used in the original step 2. Although the new calculation (30+30=60 dollars) makes sense in context, it is incorrect because it does not follow the decrement given in the original question for Jeanâ€™s dress (which is $10 less than $30). The subsequent calculations in step 3 and 4 then inherit this error, leading to the transformed_solution with a first erroneous reference appearing at the new step 2, incorrectly inflating the price of Ida's dress and ultimately the total amount.",

        "explanation": "In this transformation, I have deleted the first step, which involves Andy's return trip from school to his house. The original step 1 involves adding the two 50m trips together for a total of 100m. By removing this step, we no longer account for the return trip from school, and thus the calculation in the transformed solution refers to only one leg of the journey from the house to the school (50m). Since in our transformation we remove step 1, we then modify step 2 to include only one 50m trip, changing the formula from 140m - 100m = 40 meters to 140m - 50m = 90 meters. It should be noted that while the calculation itself is algebraically correct, the premise is wrong because it does not consider the entire trip. The first step (now also the wrong_step) references the correct number from the question and no intermediate steps are present, thus making the entire reasoning incorrect and leading to a different transformed answer.",
