        "question": "Andy walks 50 meters from his house to school. After school, he comes back to the house and goes to the market. If he walks 140 meters in total, how many meters is the distance between the house and the market?",
        "original_solution": "He walks 50m from home to school and walks 50m again from school to house, so he walks 50m + 50m = 100 meters\nIf the total distance is 140m, the distance between the house and the market is 140m - 100m = 40 meters.\n#### 40",
        "original_answer": 40.0,
        "transformed_solution": "If the total distance is 140m, the distance between the house and the market is 140m - 50m = 90 meters.\n#### 90",
        "transformed_answer": 90.0,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "missing_step",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this transformation, I have deleted the first step, which involves Andy's return trip from school to his house. The original step 1 involves adding the two 50m trips together for a total of 100m. By removing this step, we no longer account for the return trip from school, and thus the calculation in the transformed solution refers to only one leg of the journey from the house to the school (50m). Since in our transformation we remove step 1, we then modify step 2 to include only one 50m trip, changing the formula from 140m - 100m = 40 meters to 140m - 50m = 90 meters. It should be noted that while the calculation itself is algebraically correct, the premise is wrong because it does not consider the entire trip. The first step (now also the wrong_step) references the correct number from the question and no intermediate steps are present, thus making the entire reasoning incorrect and leading to a different transformed answer.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_type": "none",
        "type_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the distance between the house and the market by subtracting the known distance to school from the total distance walked, thus there are no errors in the calculation or reasoning process."
