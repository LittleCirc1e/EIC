        "question": "Milly is figuring out how long she needs to spend studying. She knows that her math homework will take 60 minutes. Her geography homework will take half as long as her math homework, and her science homework will take time equal to the mean amount of time she spent studying math and geography. How many minutes does Milly spend studying?",
        "original_solution": "First find how long Milly spends studying geography by dividing her math homework time by 2: 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes.\nNow find the total amount of time Milly spent on math and geography: 30 minutes + 60 minutes = 90 minutes.\nNow calculate the mean amount of time Milly spends on math and geography by dividing the total time spent by the number of subjects, which is 2: 90 minutes / 2 = 45 minutes.\nNow add the time Milly spent on all three subjects to find the total: 45 minutes + 30 minutes + 60 minutes = 135 minutes.\n#### 135",

        "transformed_solution": "Find the total amount of time Milly spent on math and geography [combining step 1 and 2]: 60 minutes + (60 minutes / 2) = 90 minutes.\nNow calculate the mean amount of time Milly spends on math and geography by dividing the total time spent by the number of subjects, which is 2: 90 minutes / 2 = 45 minutes.\nNow add the time Milly spent on all three subjects to find the total: 45 minutes + (60 minutes / 2) + 60 minutes = 150 minutes.\n#### 150",

        "explanation": "In the transformed_solution, the original step 1 has been removed. Thus, the reference to \"30 minutes\" in the original step 2 for the time spent on geography has been removed. In the transformed_solution, the calculation that finds the time spent on geography by dividing math homework time by 2 (60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes) is integrated into step 1. Consequently, the initial calculation in step 3 of the original solution, which calculates the mean amount of time spent on math and geography, now references the recalculated total time spent on math and geography (90 minutes) from the transformed step 1. Step 2 of the transformed solution, which calculates the total study time, also integrates this change and incorrectly calculates the total study time as 150 minutes instead of the correct 135 minutes. By removing the first step, which was the calculation of the geography homework time, the subsequent steps reference the largest number from question that step 1 references, which is \"60 minutes\" for the math homework time, leading to the incorrect transformed_answer. Therefore, the wrong_step is 1.",

The correct approach should only add the science homework time once, after finding the mean of math and geography."

The deleted step 1 would normally reference the numbers 5 and 4 from the question. However, since we're deleting the first step and not recalculating the number of species with the new additions, we're incorrectly using the original number of species (5). The subsequent step that originally referenced the result of step 1 now incorrectly references the original number of species (5), leading to the calculation of 5 * 6 = 30 minutes instead of the correct 9 * 6 = 54 minutes.

By removing the first day's 2 paintings and not adjusting the final sum to account for this absence, it results in an error in calculation. Specifically, the final sum should still be 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 as in the original solution. However, in the transformed step, the summation incorrectly doubles the calculated total to 124, which becomes the transformed_answer. Therefore, the wrong_step is the last remaining one (number 5 in the sequence of steps that have not been deleted), as it improperly adjusts for the missing step and incorrectly doubles the total count, showing a calculation error.",

The transformed solution's step 1 results in an incorrect calculation that does not represent the hair growth correctly, therefore directly leading to the wrong answer that it took 72 years for Bob to grow out his hair. The sequence of steps in the transformed_solution erroneously inflated the hair growth, directly affecting the subsequent computations, which are also incorrect but follow from the initial error in step 1.
