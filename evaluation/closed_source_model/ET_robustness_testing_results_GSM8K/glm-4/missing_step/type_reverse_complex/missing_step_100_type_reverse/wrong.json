Therefore, after deleting step 4, the remaining calculations must be modified to relate directly to the outcome of step 3. Step 4 changes from 3D = 33 to D = 38 / 3, as this step should now deal with the equation in its unresolved form since the calculation to isolate D has been removed. Subsequently, in the calculation for determining the upstairs vacuuming time in step 5, the reference to 11 minutes for D should change to use the expression 38 / 3 directly, so it goes from (2 * 11) to (2 * (38 / 3)). This step also changes the language description based on the new calculation for D. The new step computes the total time as 29 minutes.
