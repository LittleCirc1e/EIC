        "pred_wrong_type": "referencing_context_value_error",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 1. Step 1 mistakenly references that there can be 10 people onboard instead of 12 as stated in the question, which only results in an operand error in the formula, so it belongs to referencing_context_value_error. Step 2, as the subsequent step of step 1, references the wrong result of step 1, resulting in the incorrect final answer."
