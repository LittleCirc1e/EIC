        "question": "A luxury bag costs $3000. A reseller wants to get a 15% profit. How much should she sell the bag?",
        "original_solution": "The reseller wants to get $3000 x 15/100 = $450 profit.\nThus, she needs to sell it for $3000 + $450 = $3450.\n#### 3450",
        "original_answer": 3450.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The reseller wants to get $3000 x 15/100 = $450 profit. Because she provides premium packaging which costs $50, the total cost increases to $3050.\nThus, she needs to sell it for $3050 + $450 = $3500.\n#### 3500",
        "transformed_answer": 3500.0,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "adding_irrelevant_information",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 1 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <Because she provides premium packaging which costs $50>, resulting in an elevated total cost from $3000 to $3050. This affects step 2, changing the sum from $3000 + $450 to $3050 + $450. The transformed_answer is thus changed to $3500. It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_type": "none",
        "type_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the 15% profit on the cost price of the bag and adds the cost of premium packaging to the cost price before selling it. The final selling price is correctly determined by adding the profit to the total cost. Therefore, the solution is correct and does not fall into any of the specified wrong types."
