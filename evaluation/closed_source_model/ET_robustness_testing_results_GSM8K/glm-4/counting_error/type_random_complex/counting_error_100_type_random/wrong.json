        "transformed_solution": "Jasmine swims 4 days a week.\nThe number of laps per week is 12 laps/day * 4 days/week = 48 laps/week.\nIn five weeks, she swims 5 weeks * 48 laps/week = 240 laps.\n#### 240",

        "explanation": "The error was introduced in step 1, where the number of days Jasmine swims per week was changed from 5 to 4, which is incorrect and a counting error. This single mistake affected the calculation of the total number of laps in the following steps. The correct calculation is based on 5 days a week, but the error changed it to 4 days a week, resulting in a different transformed_answer of 240 laps instead of 300 laps. The rest of the calculation was performed correctly, but based on the incorrect assumption of 4 days instead of 5.",
