On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday he studies for 3 hours each day. He wants to study for a total of 25 hours over the week and divides the remaining amount of study time evenly between Saturday and Sunday. How many hours does Tristan spend studying on Saturday?",
        "original_solution": "On Tuesday, Tristan studies twice as long as he did on Monday and this amounts to 4 hours * 2 = 8 hours.\nSo in the first 5 days of the week, he studies for a total of 4 hours Monday + 8 hours Tuesday + 3 hours Wednesday + 3 hours Thursday + 3 hours Friday = 21 hours.\nHe therefore has 25 planned hours – 21 used hours = 4 hours left to study.\nAs he splits his time evenly over 2 days, he spends 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours studying on Saturday.\n#### 2",

        "original_solution": "Josh practices soccer 2 hours x 3 days = 6 hours.\nHe practices band 1.5 hours x 2 days = 3 hours.\nFrom Monday to Friday, on extracurricular activities, Josh spends 6 + 3 = 9 hours.\n#### 9",
        "original_answer": 9.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Josh practices soccer 2 hours x 4 days = 8 hours.\nHe practices band 1.5 hours x 2 days = 3 hours.\nFrom Monday to Friday, on extracurricular activities, Josh spends 8 + 3 = 11 hours.\n#### 11",

        "explanation": "In the transformed_solution, step 1 incorrectly counts soccer practice as happening for 4 days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and one additional incorrect day) instead of 3 days, resulting in 2 hours x 4 days = 8 hours instead of the correct 2 hours x 3 days = 6 hours. This error affects the final step as well, changing the total number of hours Josh spends from 9 to 11 hours. The counting result in this step is the only error, and the rest of the calculation is correctly performed based on this mistake.",

        "pred_wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 1. The calculation in step 1 incorrectly multiplies the time for soccer practice by 4 days instead of the actual 3 days, resulting in an overestimation of the time spent on soccer practice. This is a calculation_error because the operands and operators are correct, but the result is calculated incorrectly, affecting the final answer in step 3."

And it affects step 3, changing it from 2.5 + 1.5 = 4 hours to 2 + 1.5 = 3.5 hours.
