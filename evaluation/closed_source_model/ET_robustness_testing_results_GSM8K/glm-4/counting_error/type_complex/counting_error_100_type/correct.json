He drank nine liters of water on Monday, Thursday and Saturday and 8 liters of water on Tuesday, Friday and Sunday. Unfortunately, no data was input on Wednesday. How many liters of water did he drink on Wednesday?",
        "original_solution": "Gumball's total water intake on Monday, Thursday, and Saturday is 9 x 3 = 27 liters.\nAnd his total water intake on Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday is 8 x 3 = 24 liters.\nSo his total water intake for 6 days is 24 + 27 = 51 liters.\nTherefore Gumball's water intake on Wednesday is 60 - 51 = 9 liters.\n#### 9",

This results in a change of the total sum from 51 liters for 6 days to 43 liters for 5 days in step 3 and the subsequent calculation for Wednesday's intake from 9 liters to 17 liters in step 4.
