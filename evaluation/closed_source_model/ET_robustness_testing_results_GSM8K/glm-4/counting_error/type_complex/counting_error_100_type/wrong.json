        "question": "Bethany loved riding horses. She rode 1 hour after school every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. On Tuesday and Thursday, she rode for 30 min and on Saturdays, she could ride for 2 hours. How many hours in total did she ride over a 2 week period?",
        "original_solution": "She rode 1 hour every Monday, Wednesday and Friday each week so every week she rode 1*3 = 3 hours\nShe rode 30 min on Tuesday and Thursday each week for a total of 30*2 = 60 min or 1 hour\nOn Mon, Wed & Friday she rode 3 hours, 1 hour total on Tue and Thur and 2 hours on Sat for a total of 3+1+2 = 6 hours\nShe rode 6 hours per week for 2 weeks so in total she rode 6*2 = 12 hours\n#### 12",

        "explanation": "In step 3 of the transformed_solution, Saturday's 2-hour ride was mistakenly counted as 1 hour instead of 2 hours, which affected the total for each week, reducing it from 6 hours per week to 5 hours. The final step multiplies this incorrect weekly total by 2 to find the total hours over a 2 week period. Thus, 6*2=12 becomes 5*2=10. The other calculations were performed correctly.",

The correct calculation is based on 5 days a week, but the error changed it to 4 days a week, resulting in a different transformed_answer of 240 laps instead of 300 laps.
