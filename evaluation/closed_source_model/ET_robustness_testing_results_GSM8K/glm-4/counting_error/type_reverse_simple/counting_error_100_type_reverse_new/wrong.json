        "original_solution": "Jasmine swims 5 days a week.\nThe number of laps per week is 12 laps/day * 5 days/week = 60 laps/week.\nIn five weeks, she swims 5 weeks * 60 laps/week = 300 laps.\n#### 300",

        "transformed_solution": "Jasmine swims 4 days a week.\nThe number of laps per week is 12 laps/day * 4 days/week = 48 laps/week.\nIn five weeks, she swims 5 weeks * 48 laps/week = 240 laps.\n#### 240",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The error was introduced in step 1, where the number of days Jasmine swims per week was changed from 5 to 4, which is incorrect and a counting error. This single mistake affected the calculation of the total number of laps in the following steps. The correct calculation is based on 5 days a week, but the error changed it to 4 days a week, resulting in a different transformed_answer of 240 laps instead of 300 laps. The rest of the calculation was performed correctly, but based on the incorrect assumption of 4 days instead of 5.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_type": "none",
        "type_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the number of laps Jasmine swims in a week by multiplying the number of laps per day by the number of days she swims. It then correctly multiplies this weekly total by the number of weeks to get the total number of laps. There are no errors in the calculation or the information used."
