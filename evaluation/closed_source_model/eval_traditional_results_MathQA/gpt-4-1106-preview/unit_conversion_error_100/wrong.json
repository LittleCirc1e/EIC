        "question": "With both valves open, the pool will be filled with water in 48 minutes. The first valve alone would fill the pool in 2 hours. If the second valve emits 50 cubic meters of water more than the first every minute, then what is the capacity r of the pool?",
        "solution": "First, convert 2 hours to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.\nThe first valve fills the pool in 120 minutes, so its rate is r/120 cubic meters per minute.\nWith both valves open, the pool fills in 48 minutes, so the combined rate is r/48 cubic meters per minute.\nThe second valve's rate is the combined rate minus the first valve's rate: (r/48) - (r/120).\nThis is also given as 50 cubic meters more than the first valve per minute, so:\n(r/48) - (r/120) = 50.\nTo solve for r, find a common denominator and combine the terms:\n(120r - 48r) / (48 * 120) = 50\n72r / 5760 = 50\n72r = 50 * 5760\n72r = 288000\nr = 288000 / 72\nr = 4000\n#### 4000",

        "solution": "The difference in speed is due to stoppages.\nThe speed difference is 75 kmph - 45 kmph = 30 kmph.\nThis means the bus covers 30 km less distance due to stoppages in one hour.\nTo find the time for stoppages, convert the speed difference to km per minute: 30 kmph = 30/60 km/min = 0.5 km/min.\nNow, calculate the time the bus stops per hour: 30 km / 0.5 km/min = 60 minutes.\nTherefore, the bus stops for 60 minutes per hour to cover 30 km less.\n#### 60",

        "solution": "The leak empties the tank in 6 hours, so the leak empties 1/6 of the tank in 1 hour.\nThe inlet fills 6 litres a minute, so it fills 6*60 = 360 litres in 1 hour.\nWhen both the inlet and the leak are open, the tank empties in 12 hours, which means the effective emptying rate is 1/12 of the tank in 1 hour.\nLet the capacity of the tank be C litres.\nThen, the inlet fills 360 litres/hour and the leak empties C/6 litres/hour.\nFor the tank to be empty in 12 hours, the inlet and the leak together empty 1/12 of the tank in 1 hour.\nSo, 360 - C/6 = C/12\nMultiplying through by 12 to clear the fractions: 12*360 - 2C = C\n4320 - 2C = C\n4320 = 3C\nC = 4320 / 3\nC = 1440 litres\n#### 1440",
