        "solution": "Each round trip is 200 meters to the ditch and 200 meters back to the nest, for a total of 400 meters per trip.\nThe crow makes 15 trips, so the total distance is 15 x 400 = 6000 meters.\n1 and a half hours is the same as 1.5 hours.\nTo find the speed in kilometers per hour, convert meters to kilometers (6000 meters = 6 kilometers) and divide by the time in hours.\nThe speed of the crow is 6 km / 1.5 hours = 4 km/h.\n#### 4",
