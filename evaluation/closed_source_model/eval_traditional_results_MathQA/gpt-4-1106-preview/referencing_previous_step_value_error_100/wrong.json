        "solution": "First, find the rate at which 36 machines fill orders: 4 orders / 4 hours = 1 order per hour.\nThen, find the rate per machine: 1 order per hour / 36 machines = 1/36 orders per machine per hour.\nDoubling the number of machines to 72 should double the rate: 1/36 * 2 = 1/18 orders per machine per hour.\nTo fill 12 orders at the rate of 1/18 orders per machine per hour, it would take: 12 orders / (1/18 orders per machine per hour) = 12 * 18 hours.\n#### 216",

        "solution": "Let the total worth of the stock be Rs. x.\nHe sells 10% of the stock at 20% profit, so the profit from this sale is 0.10x * 0.20 = 0.02x.\nHe sells the remaining 90% of the stock at 5% loss, so the loss from this sale is 0.90x * 0.05 = 0.045x.\nThe overall loss is the loss from the second sale minus the profit from the first sale, which is 0.045x - 0.02x = 0.025x.\nSince the overall loss is Rs. 400, we have 0.025x = 400.\nTo find the total worth of the stock, we solve for x: x = 400 / 0.025.\nx = 16000.\n#### 16000",

        "solution": "First, convert the jogger's lead from meters to kilometers: 240 m = 0.24 km.\nNext, calculate the relative speed of the train with respect to the jogger: 27 km/hr - 9 km/hr = 18 km/hr.\nNow, find the total distance the train needs to cover to pass the jogger, which includes the jogger's lead and the length of the train: 0.24 km + 0.12 km = 0.36 km.\nFinally, calculate the time it takes for the train to cover that distance at the relative speed: Time = Distance / Speed = 0.36 km / 18 km/hr = 0.02 hr.\nConvert the time from hours to minutes: 0.02 hr * 60 minutes/hr = 1.2 minutes.\n#### 1.2",

        "solution": "Let the distance q runs be x meters.\nSince p runs 20% faster than q, p runs at a speed of 1.2 times the speed of q.\nWhen q has run x meters, p has run x - 300 meters due to the head start.\nSince the race ends in a tie, the time taken by p and q to run their respective distances is the same.\nLet t be the time taken by q to run x meters.\nThen, the speed of q is x/t and the speed of p is (x - 300)/t.\nSince p's speed is 1.2 times q's speed, we have (x - 300)/t = 1.2(x/t).\nSolving for x gives x = 1.2x - 360.\nThis simplifies to 0.2x = 360.\nTherefore, x = 360 / 0.2 = 1800 meters.\nSince p runs x - 300 meters, p runs 1800 - 300 = 1500 meters.\n#### 1500",
