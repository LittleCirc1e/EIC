        "solution": "Let the total worth of the stock be Rs. x.\nHe sells 10% of the stock at 20% profit, so the profit from this sale is 0.10x * 0.20 = 0.02x.\nHe sells the remaining 90% of the stock at a loss of 5%, so the loss from this sale is 0.90x * 0.05 = 0.045x.\nThe overall loss is the loss from the second sale minus the profit from the first sale, which is 0.045x - 0.02x = 0.025x.\nThis overall loss is given as Rs. 400, so 0.025x = 400.\nTo find the total worth of the stock, we solve for x: x = 400 / 0.025.\nx = 16000.\n#### 16000",

        "solution": "The total quantity of the mixture is 60 litres.\nThe ratio of milk to water is 2:1, which means that out of every 3 parts, 2 parts are milk and 1 part is water.\nSo, milk = (2/3) * 60 = 40 litres and water = (1/3) * 60 = 20 litres.\nTo make the ratio of milk to water 1:2, the quantity of milk should be equal to the quantity of water already present, which is 20 litres.\nNow, we need to find out how much water to add to make the ratio of the water double that of the milk, which means water should be 40 litres.\nTherefore, we need to add 40 litres - 20 litres = 20 litres of water to the mixture.\n#### 20",

        "solution": "Sarah drove 50 miles in the first hour at 50 miles per hour.\nIf she continued at 50 mph, she would be 1 hour late. When she increases her speed to 100 mph, she gains 1 hour and 30 minutes (1.5 hours) on the trip, meaning the rest of the trip at 50 mph would take 1.5 hours.\nAt 50 mph, the distance for the remaining trip is 50 mph * 1.5 hours = 75 miles.\nThe total distance is the sum of the first part and the remaining trip, which is 50 miles + 75 miles = 125 miles.\n#### 125",

        "solution": "Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\nThe formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/100)^n, where A is the amount, P is the principal, n is the number of years, and r is the rate.\nThe formula for simple interest is SI = P * n * r / 100.\nFor compound interest, A = 20000(1 + r/100)^2.\nFor simple interest, SI = 20000 * 2 * r / 100 = 400r.\nThe difference between compound and simple interest is given as $72.\nSo, 20000(1 + r/100)^2 - 20000 - 400r = 72.\nSimplifying, we get (1 + r/100)^2 = 1 + (72 + 400r) / 20000.\nExpanding the left side, we get 1 + 2r/100 + (r/100)^2 = 1 + 72/20000 + 400r/20000.\nSimplifying further, we get 2r/100 + (r/100)^2 = 72/20000 + 20r/100.\nNow, we can cancel out the 1 on both sides and multiply through by 100^2 to avoid decimals: 2r + r^2 = 72 * 100 + 20r * 100.\nThis simplifies to r^2 + 2r - 20r = 72 * 100.\nFurther simplification gives r^2 - 18r - 7200 = 0.\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form of ar^2 + br + c = 0.\nWe can solve for r using the quadratic formula, r = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a).\nHere, a = 1, b = -18, and c = -7200.\nUsing the quadratic formula, r = [18 ± sqrt(18^2 - 4 * 1 * (-7200))] / (2 * 1).\nThis simplifies to r = [18 ± sqrt(324 + 28800)] / 2.\nFurther simplification gives r = [18 ± sqrt(29124)] / 2.\nSince the rate cannot be negative, we take the positive root: r = [18 + sqrt(29124)] / 2.\nCalculating the square root, we get r = [18 + 170.66] / 2.\nFinally, r = 188.66 / 2.\nTherefore, r = 94.33.\nBut we need to check which value of r satisfies the original condition of the difference being $72.\nPlugging r = 94.33 into the difference equation, we get:\n20000(1 + 94.33/100)^2 - 20000 - 400 * 94.33 = 72.\nCalculating the left side, we get:\n20000(1.9433)^2 - 20000 - 37732 = 72.\nThis gives:\n20000 * 3.774489 - 20000 - 37732 ≈ 72.\nWhich simplifies to:\n75489.78 - 20000 - 37732 ≈ 72.\nAnd further to:\n17757.78 ≈ 72, which is not true.\nTherefore, we must have made a mistake in our calculations.\nWe need to find the correct value of r that satisfies the condition.\nLet's go back to the step where we have the quadratic equation r^2 - 18r - 7200 = 0.\nWe can factor this equation to find the roots.\nThe factors of 7200 that add up to -18 are -90 and 80.\nSo, the equation can be factored as (r - 90)(r + 80) = 0.\nThis gives us two possible values for r: r = 90 or r = -80.\nSince the rate cannot be negative, we take r = 90.\nTherefore, the rate of interest per annum is 90%.\n#### 90",
