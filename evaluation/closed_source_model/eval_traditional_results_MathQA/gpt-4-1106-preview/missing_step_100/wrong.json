        "solution": "To find the number of bars in the last box, we need to find the remainder when 853845 is divided by 9.\n853845 divided by 9 gives a remainder of 853845 % 9 = 7.\nTherefore, there will be 7 bars of chocolate in the last unfilled box.\n#### 7",

        "solution": "Let x be the total number of birds initially.\nAfter 1/3 fly away, 2/3 of x are left.\nThen 2/5 of the remaining birds leave, so 3/5 of 2/3 of x are left.\nThen 2/3 of the remaining birds leave, so 1/3 of 3/5 of 2/3 of x are left.\nAt last, 8 birds are remaining, so 1/3 of 3/5 of 2/3 of x = 8.\nSolving for x, we have x = 8 * 3 / (1/3 * 3/5 * 2/3).\nSimplifying, x = 8 * 3 / (1/5).\nSo, x = 8 * 3 * 5.\nTherefore, x = 120.\n#### 120",

        "solution": "First, convert the speed from kmph to m/s by multiplying with 5/18.\nThe speed of the train in m/s is 60 * (5/18) = 16.67 m/s.\nThe speed of the man in m/s is 6 * (5/18) = 1.67 m/s.\nThe relative speed of the train with respect to the man is 16.67 + 1.67 = 18.34 m/s.\nTime taken to pass the man = Distance / Relative Speed = 440 / 18.34 = 23.98 seconds.\n#### 23.98",

        "solution": "Let the distance q runs be x meters.\nSince p runs 20% faster than q, p runs at a speed of 1.2 times the speed of q.\nWhen q has run x meters, p has run x - 300 meters due to the head start.\nSince the race ends in a tie, the time taken by p and q to run their respective distances is the same.\nLet t be the time taken by both runners.\nFor q: distance = speed * time, so x = q_speed * t.\nFor p: distance = speed * time, so x - 300 = 1.2 * q_speed * t.\nSince the times are equal, we can set the distances equal to each other divided by their speeds:\nx / q_speed = (x - 300) / (1.2 * q_speed).\nSolving for x gives us x = (x - 300) / 1.2.\nMultiplying both sides by 1.2 to clear the fraction gives us 1.2x = x - 300.\nSubtracting x from both sides gives us 0.2x = -300.\nDividing both sides by 0.2 gives us x = -300 / 0.2.\nCalculating the value of x gives us x = 1500 meters.\nTherefore, p ran 1500 - 300 = 1200 meters in the race.\n#### 1200",

She then travels 100 miles per hour for the rest of the trip, and arrives 30 minutes before her flight departs. How many miles did she drive in all?",
        "solution": "Sarah drove 50 miles in the first hour at 50 miles per hour.\nIf she continued at 50 miles per hour, she would be an hour late. This means the total time at 50 miles per hour would be the actual flight time plus 1 hour.\nWhen she increases her speed to 100 miles per hour, she arrives 30 minutes early. This means the total time at 100 miles per hour is the actual flight time minus 0.5 hours.\nLet the actual flight time be t hours. Then, the time she would have taken at 50 miles per hour is t + 1 hours, and the time at 100 miles per hour is t - 0.5 hours.\nSince she drives the same distance at 50 miles per hour and 100 miles per hour, we can set up the equation: 50(t + 1) = 100(t - 0.5).\nSolving for t gives: 50t + 50 = 100t - 50.\nThis simplifies to 50 = 50t, so t = 1 hour.\nThe total distance is the distance she would have traveled at 50 miles per hour for the actual flight time plus 1 hour, which is 50(1 + 1) = 100 miles.\nTherefore, Sarah drove 50 miles in the first hour plus 100 miles for the rest of the trip, which is 50 + 100 = 150 miles in all.\n#### 150",
