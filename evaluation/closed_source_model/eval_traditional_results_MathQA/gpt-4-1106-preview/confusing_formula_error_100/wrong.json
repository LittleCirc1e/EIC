        "solution": "The perimeter of a rectangle is given by P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.\nFor a perimeter of 42, we have 2(l + w) = 42.\nSolving for l + w gives us l + w = 42 / 2 = 21.\nTo maximize the area, we set l = w, so the rectangle is a square. The largest area is when l = w = 21 / 2 = 10.5, but since we need positive integers, the closest is l = w = 10, giving an area of 10 * 10 = 100.\nTo minimize the area, we set one side to be as small as possible, which is 1. So if w = 1, then l = 21 - 1 = 20, giving an area of 20 * 1 = 20.\nThe difference between the largest and smallest possible areas is 100 - 20 = 80.\n#### 80",
