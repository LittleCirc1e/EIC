        "question": "The area of a square garden is q square feet and the perimeter is p feet. If q = 2p + 20, what is the perimeter of the garden in feet?",
        "solution": "Let s be the side length of the square garden.\nThe area of the square garden is s^2 = q.\nThe perimeter of the square garden is 4s = p.\nSince q = 2p + 20, we can write s^2 = 2p + 20.\nWe also know that s^2 = (p/4)^2 because s = p/4 (from the perimeter formula).\nEquating the two expressions for s^2 gives us (p/4)^2 = 2p + 20.\nSolving for p, we get p^2/16 = 2p + 20.\nMultiplying through by 16 gives p^2 = 32p + 320.\nRearranging gives p^2 - 32p - 320 = 0.\nFactoring the quadratic equation, we find (p - 40)(p + 8) = 0.\nSince the perimeter cannot be negative, p - 40 = 0.\nTherefore, p = 40 feet.\n#### 40",

(Equation 2)\nFrom Equation 1, we can express b as b = 7 - l.\nSubstituting b into Equation 2, we get l^2 + (7 - l)^2 = 25.\nExpanding the equation, l^2 + 49 - 14l + l^2 = 25.\nCombining like terms, 2l^2 - 14l + 49 - 25 = 0.\nSimplifying, 2l^2 - 14l + 24 = 0.\nDividing by 2, l^2 - 7l + 12 = 0.\nFactoring the quadratic, (l - 3)(l - 4) = 0.\nSo, l = 3 cm or l = 4 cm.\nIf l = 3 cm, then b = 7 - 3 = 4 cm.\nIf l = 4 cm, then b = 7 - 4 = 3 cm.\nBoth pairs of (l, b) are valid as rectangles can be rotated.\nThe area A of a rectangle is given by A = l * b.\nSo, A = 3 cm * 4 cm = 12 cm^2.\n#### 12",
