Last week Mo drank a total of 16 cups of tea and hot chocolate together. If during that week Mo drank 4 more tea cups than hot chocolate cups, then how many rainy days were there last week?",
        "solution": "Let the number of rainy days be r and the number of non-rainy days be t.\nSince Mo drinks n cups of hot chocolate on rainy days, the total cups of hot chocolate is n*r.\nSince Mo drinks 2 cups of tea on non-rainy days, the total cups of tea is 2*t.\nWe are given that the total cups of tea and hot chocolate is 16, so n*r + 2*t = 16.\nWe are also given that Mo drank 4 more cups of tea than hot chocolate, so 2*t = n*r + 4.\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get 16 - (n*r + 4) = n*r, which simplifies to 16 - 4 = 2*n*r.\nThis simplifies further to 12 = 2*n*r.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, r + t = 7.\nSubstituting t = 7 - r into the second equation, we get 2*(7 - r) = n*r + 4.\nThis simplifies to 14 - 2*r = n*r + 4.\nSubtracting 4 from both sides gives 10 - 2*r = n*r.\nAdding 2*r to both sides gives 10 = n*r + 2*r.\nFactoring out r from the right side gives 10 = r*(n + 2).\nSince n is the number of cups of hot chocolate Mo drinks on rainy days and we are looking for the number of rainy days, we need to find a value of r that satisfies the equation 10 = r*(n + 2) where r and n are integers and r is less than or equal to 7.\nThe only values that satisfy this are r = 2 and n = 3 because 10 = 2*(3 + 2).\nTherefore, there were 2 rainy days last week.\n#### 2",

        "solution": "Let x be the number of miles Bill ran on Saturday.\nThen Bill ran x + 4 miles on Sunday.\nJulia ran 2(x + 4) miles on Sunday because she ran twice the number of miles Bill ran.\nTotal miles ran on Saturday and Sunday is x + (x + 4) + 2(x + 4) = 32.\nCombining like terms, we get 4x + 12 = 32.\nSubtracting 12 from both sides, we get 4x = 20.\nDividing both sides by 4, we get x = 5.\nSo, Bill ran 5 + 4 = 9 miles on Sunday.\n#### 9",

        "solution": "Let x be the number of trucks rented out during the week.\n50% of the trucks rented out were returned, so 0.5x trucks were returned.\nThere were at least 14 trucks on the lot on Saturday morning.\nThis means that 26 - x + 0.5x (trucks returned) >= 14.\nSolving for x gives: 26 - 0.5x >= 14.\nSubtract 26 from both sides: -0.5x >= -12.\nDivide both sides by -0.5 (and reverse the inequality sign because we are dividing by a negative number): x <= 24.\nThe greatest integer less than or equal to 24 is 24.\nTherefore, the greatest number of different trucks that could have been rented out during the week is 24.\n#### 24",
