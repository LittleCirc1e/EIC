        "solution": "Each boundary is worth 4 runs, so 3 boundaries are worth 3 * 4 = 12 runs.\nEach six is worth 6 runs, so 8 sixes are worth 8 * 6 = 48 runs.\nRuns made by running between the wickets = Total runs - (Boundary runs + Six runs)\nRuns made by running between the wickets = 210 - (12 + 48)\nRuns made by running between the wickets = 210 - 60\nRuns made by running between the wickets = 150\nPercentage of total score made by running = (Runs made by running between the wickets / Total runs) * 100\nPercentage of total score made by running = (150 / 210) * 100\nPercentage of total score made by running = 0.7142857142857143 * 100\nPercentage of total score made by running = 71.42857142857143\n#### 71.42857142857143",
