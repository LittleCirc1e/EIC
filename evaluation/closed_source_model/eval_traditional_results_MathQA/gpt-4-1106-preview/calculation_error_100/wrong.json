        "question": "For how many integer values of n will the value of the expression 4n + 7 be an integer greater than 1 and less than 200?",
        "solution": "The expression 4n + 7 must be greater than 1 and less than 200.\nSo, 1 < 4n + 7 < 200.\nSubtract 7 from all parts of the inequality: -6 < 4n < 193.\nDivide all parts of the inequality by 4: -1.5 < n < 48.25.\nSince n must be an integer, n can range from -1 to 48.\nHowever, n cannot be -1 because 4(-1) + 7 = 3, which is not greater than 1.\nTherefore, the smallest integer value for n is 0.\nThe largest integer value for n is 48.\nThere are 48 - 0 + 1 = 49 integer values for n.\n#### 49",

It is known that factory x supplies 70% of the total bulbs available. What is the chance that a purchased bulb will work for longer than 5000 hours?",
        "solution": "Let's calculate the probability that a bulb works for over 5000 hours.\nProbability that a bulb is from factory x and works over 5000 hours = 70% of 75% = 0.7 * 0.75\nProbability that a bulb is from factory y and works over 5000 hours = 30% of 65% = 0.3 * 0.65\nTotal probability = Probability from factory x + Probability from factory y\nTotal probability = 0.7 * 0.75 + 0.3 * 0.65\nTotal probability = 0.525 + 0.195\nTotal probability = 0.72\n#### 0.72",

        "solution": "The initial charge is $1.85 for the first quarter mile.\nThe remaining amount is $4.90 - $1.85 = $3.05.\nEach additional quarter mile costs $0.15.\nThe number of additional quarters that can be covered is $3.05 / $0.15 = 20.333..., but only whole quarters count, so 20 additional quarters.\nThe total distance is the first quarter mile plus 20 additional quarters, which is 1 + 20 = 21 quarters of a mile.\n21 quarters of a mile is 21 * 0.25 = 5.25 miles.\n#### 5.25",

        "question": "45 persons can repair a road in 12 days, working 5 hours a day. In how many days will 30 persons, working 6 hours a day, complete the work?",
        "solution": "First, calculate the total hours of work required to repair the road by 45 persons.\nTotal hours = 45 persons * 12 days * 5 hours/day = 2700 hours\n\nNow, calculate how many hours 30 persons would take to complete the same work.\nSince the work is constant, we can set up a proportion:\n(45 persons * 5 hours/day) / (30 persons * 6 hours/day) = 12 days / x days\n(225 hours/day) / (180 hours/day) = 12 days / x days\n\nSolving for x gives:\n225x = 12 * 180\n225x = 2160\nx = 2160 / 225\nx = 9.6 days\n\nTherefore, 30 persons working 6 hours a day will complete the work in 9.6 days.\n#### 9.6",

        "solution": "Let the rate of interest be r% per annum.\nSimple Interest (S.I.) for 2 years = P * r * t / 100\nCompound Interest (C.I.) for 2 years = P * ((1 + r/100)^t - 1)\nDifference between C.I. and S.I. is given as $72.\nSo, C.I. - S.I. = $72\n=> 20000 * ((1 + r/100)^2 - 1) - (20000 * r * 2 / 100) = 72\n=> (20000 * (1 + r/100)^2 - 20000) - (20000 * 2r / 100) = 72\n=> 20000 * ((1 + r/100)^2 - 1 - 2r/100) = 72\n=> (1 + r/100)^2 - 1 - 2r/100 = 72/20000\n=> (1 + r/100)^2 = 1 + 2r/100 + 72/20000\n=> (1 + r/100)^2 = 1 + 2r/100 + 0.0036\n=> (1 + r/100)^2 = 1.0036 + 2r/100\nLet's assume (1 + r/100) = x\n=> x^2 = 1.0036 + 2r/100\n=> x^2 - x = 0.0036\n=> x(x - 1) = 0.0036\nSince x = 1 + r/100, x cannot be 1 (otherwise r would be 0, which is not possible because there is a difference in C.I. and S.I.)\n=> x - 1 = 0.0036\n=> 1 + r/100 - 1 = 0.0036\n=> r/100 = 0.0036\n=> r = 0.0036 * 100\n=> r = 0.36\nThe rate of interest per annum is 0.36%.\n#### 0.36",

        "solution": "First, convert the speed from kmph to m/s by multiplying with 5/18.\nThe speed of the train in m/s is 60 * (5/18) = 16.67 m/s.\nThe speed of the man in m/s is 6 * (5/18) = 1.67 m/s.\nThe relative speed of the train with respect to the man is 16.67 + 1.67 = 18.34 m/s.\nTime taken to pass the man = length of the train / relative speed = 440 / 18.34\nThe time taken to pass the man is approximately 23.98 seconds.\n#### 23.98",
