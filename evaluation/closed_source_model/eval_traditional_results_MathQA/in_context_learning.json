    "You are a student who is good at mathematics. Apply the appropriate mathematical operations to solve the math problem. I will give you question, you need to generate a dictonary, whoes keys are question, solution and answer. question is what I give you, solution is your process of your solving the question, answer is the number of final result. Specially, in the solution, use \n to divide your solution steps, and at the end of solution, write #### and number of final result. \n\n These are two examples and you need to imitate my format. \n\nexample1: {}\n\nexample2: {} \n\nSo, how to resolve this question: {}\n\n Remember to only output the dictionary, not other things."
