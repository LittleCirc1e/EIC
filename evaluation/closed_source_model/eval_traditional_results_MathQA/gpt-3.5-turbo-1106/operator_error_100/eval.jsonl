{"question": "A cistern can be filled by a tap in 3 hours while it can be emptied by another tap in 8 hours. If both the taps are opened simultaneously, then after how much time will the cistern get filled?", "solution": "The rate of filling of the first tap is 1/3 cistern per hour because 1 / 3 = 0.333\nThe rate of emptying of the second tap is 1/8 cistern per hour because 1 / 8 = 0.125\nThe combined rate of both taps is 0.333 - 0.125 = 0.208 cistern per hour\nIt will take 4.8 hours to fill the cistern because 1 / 0.208 = 4.8\n#### 4.8", "answer": 4.8, "correct": 4.8}
