The percentage of error in the calculated area of the square is", "solution": "Let the actual side of the square be x.\nThe error made is 4% in excess, so the measured side is 1.04x.\nThe actual area of the square is x^2.\nThe measured area of the square is (1.04x)^2 = 1.0816x^2.\nThe percentage of error in the calculated area of the square is ((1.0816x^2 - x^2) / x^2) * 100 = 8.16%.\n#### 8.16", "answer": 8.16, "correct": 8.16}
{"question": "Find the area of right angled triangle whose hypotenuse is 15 cm and one of the sides is 12 cm.", "solution": "Let the other side be x.\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, 12^2 + x^2 = 15^2\n144 + x^2 = 225\nx^2 = 225 - 144\nx^2 = 81\nx = \u221a81\nx = 9\nThe area of the triangle is (1/2) * 12 * 9 = 54\n#### 54", "answer": 54, "correct": 54.0}
{"question": "Two cubes of tire sides ratio 2 : 3 . find its cube volumes ratio ?", "solution": "Let the sides of the cubes be 2x and 3x.\nThe volume of the first cube is (2x)^3 = 8x^3\nThe volume of the second cube is (3x)^3 = 27x^3\nThe ratio of the volumes is 8x^3 : 27x^3\n#### 8:27", "answer": "8:27", "correct": "8:27"}
{"question": "Eight cubes, each with a volume of 512 cm^3, are joined to form one large cube. What is the surface area of the large cube?", "solution": "The side length of each small cube is the cube root of 512, which is 8.\nThe side length of the large cube is 8 x 2 = 16.\nThe surface area of the large cube is 6 x 16^2 = 1536 cm^2.\n#### 1536", "answer": 1536, "correct": 1536.0}
{"question": "What is the area of an obtuse angled triangle whose two sides are 8 and 12 and the angle included between the two sides is 150 o ?", "solution": "The area of the triangle is A = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C) where a and b are the two sides and C is the included angle.\nA = (1/2) * 8 * 12 * sin(150)\nA = (1/2) * 8 * 12 * (sqrt(3)/2)\nA = 48 * (sqrt(3)/2)\nA = 24 * sqrt(3)\n#### 24 * sqrt(3)", "answer": "24 * sqrt(3)", "correct": 24.0}
{"question": "Two cubes each with side b are joined to form a cuboid. What is the surface area of this cuboid?", "solution": "The surface area of the cuboid is the sum of the areas of all six faces.\nThe area of each face of the cuboid is the product of the length and width.\nThe length of the cuboid is b and the width is 2b because two cubes are joined together.\nThe area of the top and bottom faces is b * 2b = 2b^2.\nThe area of the front and back faces is b * b = b^2.\nThe area of the left and right faces is b * b = b^2.\nThe total surface area is 2b^2 + 2b^2 + b^2 + b^2 = 6b^2.\n#### 6b^2", "answer": "6b^2", "correct": "10b^2"}
{"question": "A rectangular field has a length 10 meters more than its width. If the area of the field is 144, what is the length (in meters) of the rectangular field?", "solution": "Let the width of the field be x meters.\nThe length of the field is x + 10 meters.\nThe area of the field is x(x + 10) = 144.\nx^2 + 10x - 144 = 0.\n(x + 18)(x - 8) = 0.\nTherefore, x = 8 or x = -18. Since the width cannot be negative, x = 8.\nThe length of the field is 8 + 10 = 18 meters.\n#### 18", "answer": 18, "correct": 18.0}
{"question": "A cube has a volume of 64 cubic feet. If a similar cube is twice as long, twice as wide, and twice as high, then the volume, in cubic feet, of such cube is?", "solution": "The volume of the larger cube is 2*2*2=8 times the volume of the original cube because 2*2*2=8\nThe volume of the larger cube is 64*8=512 cubic feet because 64*8=512\n#### 512", "answer": 512, "correct": 512.0}
