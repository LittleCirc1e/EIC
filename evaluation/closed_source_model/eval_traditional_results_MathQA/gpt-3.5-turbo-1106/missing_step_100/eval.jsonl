Then, the sum of the reciprocals of their squares is", "solution": "Let the two natural numbers be x and y.\nWe have xy = 3.\nThe sum of the reciprocals of their squares is 1/x^2 + 1/y^2.\nWe know that 1/x^2 + 1/y^2 = (x^2 + y^2)/(x^2y^2).\nWe also know that (x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy.\nSo, (x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2*3.\n(x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 6.\n(x + y)^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 6.\n2xy = 6.\nxy = 3.\nSo, 1/x^2 + 1/y^2 = (x^2 + y^2)/(x^2y^2) = ((x + y)^2 - 2xy)/(x^2y^2) = ((x + y)^2 - 2*3)/(3^2) = ((x + y)^2 - 6)/9.\nSo, the sum of the reciprocals of their squares is ((x + y)^2 - 6)/9.\n#### ((x + y)^2 - 6)/9", "answer": "((x + y)^2 - 6)/9", "correct": 1.1111111111111112}
{"question": "According to these definitions, the value of o(3.2) + e(\u20131.7) + o(\u20133.3) + e(4.7) is:", "solution": "The value of o(3.2) is 3.2\nThe value of e(\u20131.7) is -1.7\nThe value of o(\u20133.3) is -3.3\nThe value of e(4.7) is 4.7\nThe sum of these values is 3.2 - 1.7 - 3.3 + 4.7 = 3.2\n#### 3.2", "answer": 3.2, "correct": 4.0}
{"question": "On Independence Day, bananas were to be equally distributed among the children in a school so that each child would get two bananas. On that particular day, 390 children were absent, and as a result, each child got two extra bananas. Find the actual number of children in the school.", "solution": "Let x be the actual number of children in the school.\nEach child was supposed to get 2x bananas.\nDue to the absence of 390 children, the total number of bananas distributed was 2(x-390).\nAccording to the problem, 2(x-390) = 2x + 780.\nSolving for x, we get x = 780.\n#### 780", "answer": 780, "correct": 780.0}
{"question": "x can finish a work in 21 days. y can finish the same work in 15 days. y worked for 5 days and left the job. how many days does x alone need to finish the remaining work?", "solution": "In one day, x can finish 1/21 of the work because 1/21 x 21 = 1\nIn one day, y can finish 1/15 of the work because 1/15 x 15 = 1\nIn 5 days, y finished 5/15 of the work because 1/15 x 5 = 1/3\nThe remaining work is 2/3 because 1 - 1/3 = 2/3\nx can finish the remaining work in 14 days because 2/3 x 21 = 14\n#### 14", "answer": 14, "correct": 14.0}
{"question": "a group of men decided to do a work in 20 days , but 2 of them became absent . if the rest of the group did the work in 22 days , find the original number of men ?", "solution": "Let x be the original number of men.\n20x = 22(x-2)\n20x = 22x - 44\n44 = 2x\nx = 22\n#### 22", "answer": 22, "correct": 22.0}
{"question": "John bought 9.25 m of cloth for $ 434.75. Find the cost price per metre.", "solution": "Cost price per metre = Total cost / Total metres\nCost price per metre = 434.75 / 9.25\nCost price per metre = 47\n#### 47", "answer": 47, "correct": 47.0}
{"question": "There are 15 teams in a soccer league and each team plays each of the other teams once. How many games will be played in total?", "solution": "Each team will play 14 games because 15 - 1 = 14\nThere are 105 total games because 15 x 14 / 2 = 105\n#### 105", "answer": 105, "correct": 105.0}
