        "solution": "Let x be the total income.\nProvident fund = x / 16\nRemaining income = x - x / 16 = 15x / 16\nInsurance premium = 1 / 15 * 15x / 16 = x / 16\nBalance = 15x / 16 - x / 16 = 14x / 16\nDomestic needs = 5 / 7 * 14x / 16 = 5x / 8\nAmount deposited in the bank = 14x / 16 - 5x / 8 + 50\n14x / 16 - 5x / 8 + 50 = x\n14x - 10x + 800 = 16x\n800 = 2x\nx = 400\n#### 400",

If the distance between their homes is 36 kilometers, Maxwell's walking speed is 3 km/h, and Brad's running speed is 6 km/h. What is the distance traveled by Maxwell when they meet in the middle?",
        "solution": "The total distance traveled by Maxwell and Brad is 36 kilometers.\nThe combined speed of Maxwell and Brad is 3 + 6 = 9 km/h.\nThe time it takes for them to meet is 36 / 9 = 4 hours.\nMaxwell travels half the distance, which is 36 / 2 = 18 kilometers.\n#### 18",

        "solution": "Gear l makes 20 revolutions per minute, so it makes 20/60 = 1/3 revolution per second.\nGear r makes 40 revolutions per minute, so it makes 40/60 = 2/3 revolution per second.\nGear r will make 6 more revolutions than gear l after 6 / (2/3 - 1/3) = 18 seconds.\n#### 18",

        "solution": "First, convert the speeds from km/hr to m/s:\n120 km/hr = 120 * 1000 / 60 / 60 = 33.33 m/s\n80 km/hr = 80 * 1000 / 60 / 60 = 22.22 m/s\n\nThen, find the relative speed of the two trains:\n33.33 m/s + 22.22 m/s = 55.55 m/s\n\nFinally, use the formula distance = speed * time to find the length of the other train:\ndistance = 55.55 m/s * 9 s = 500 m\n\nTherefore, the length of the other train is 500 m.\n#### 500",
