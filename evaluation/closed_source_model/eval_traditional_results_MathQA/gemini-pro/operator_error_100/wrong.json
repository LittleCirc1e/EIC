        "solution": "Let x be the speed of the bus in kmph.\nThe consumption of diesel per hour is proportional to x^2.\nWhen x = 70, the consumption is 1 litre per hour.\nSo, the consumption of diesel per hour is (1/70^2) * x^2 litres.\nThe cost of diesel per hour is (1/70^2) * x^2 * 70 = x^2 dollars.\nThe total cost per hour is x^2 + 70 dollars.\nThe time taken to cover 700 km is 700/x hours.\nThe total cost to cover 700 km is (x^2 + 70) * 700/x dollars.\nTo find the minimum cost, we can differentiate the total cost with respect to x and set it equal to 0.\nd/dx [(x^2 + 70) * 700/x] = 0\n700 - 1400/x^2 = 0\nx^2 = 2\nx = sqrt(2)\nThe minimum cost is (2 + 70) * 700/sqrt(2) dollars.\n#### 49000",

        "question": "the area of an isosceles trapezoid with sides of length 5 and bases of length 6 and 12 is ?",
        "solution": "The area of an isosceles trapezoid is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * (sum of bases) * height\nThe sum of the bases is 6 + 12 = 18\nThe height can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: h^2 = 5^2 - (18/2)^2\nh^2 = 25 - 81\nh^2 = -56\nh = sqrt(-56) = 7.48331477354\nThe area is (1/2) * 18 * 7.48331477354 = 67.3498334619\n#### 67.3498334619",
        "answer": 67.3498334619,

        "question": "Maxwell leaves his home and walks toward Brad's house at the same time that Brad leaves his home and runs toward Maxwell's house. If the distance between their homes is 36 kilometers, Maxwell's walking speed is 3 km/h, and Brad's running speed is 6 km/h. What is the distance traveled by Maxwell when they meet in the middle?",
        "solution": "The total distance traveled by Maxwell and Brad is 36 kilometers.\nThe combined speed of Maxwell and Brad is 3 + 6 = 9 km/h.\nThe time it takes for them to meet is 36 / 9 = 4 hours.\nMaxwell travels half the distance, which is 36 / 2 = 18 kilometers.\n#### 18",
        "answer": 18,
        "correct": 12.0
