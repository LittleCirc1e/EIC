        "question": "sarah is driving to the airport . after driving at 50 miles per hour for one hour , she realizes that if she continues at that same average rate she will be an hour late for her flight . she then travels 100 miles per hour for the rest of the trip , and arrives 30 minutes before her flight departs . how many miles did she drive in all ?",
        "solution": "Let x be the number of miles she drove at 100 miles per hour.\nShe drove 50 miles in the first hour.\nShe drove x miles in the second part of the trip.\nShe drove a total of 50 + x miles.\nShe arrived 30 minutes early, which is 0.5 hours.\nShe drove x miles in 0.5 hours at 100 miles per hour.\nSo, x = 0.5 * 100 = 50.\nShe drove a total of 50 + 50 = 100 miles.\n#### 100",

        "question": "An alloy of copper and zinc contains copper and zinc in the ratio 5 : 3. Another alloy of copper and zinc contains copper and zinc in the ratio 1 : 7. In what ratio should the two alloys be mixed so that the resultant alloy contains equal proportions of copper and zinc?",
        "solution": "Let the ratio of the first alloy to the second alloy be x : y.\nThe amount of copper in the first alloy is 5x and the amount of zinc is 3x.\nThe amount of copper in the second alloy is x and the amount of zinc is 7y.\nSince the resultant alloy contains equal proportions of copper and zinc, we have 5x + x = 3x + 7y.\nSimplifying the equation, we get 6x = 10y.\nDividing both sides by 2, we get 3x = 5y.\nTherefore, the ratio of the first alloy to the second alloy is 3 : 5.\n#### 3 : 5",
        "answer": "3 : 5",
        "correct": "3:1"

        "solution": "Let x be the number of kgs of fresh grapes needed.\nThe amount of water in x kgs of fresh grapes is 0.85x kgs.\nThe amount of water in 20 kgs of raisins is 0.25 * 20 = 5 kgs.\nSince the amount of water in the fresh grapes is equal to the amount of water in the raisins, we can set up the equation 0.85x = 5.\nSolving for x, we get x = 5 / 0.85 = 5.88.\n#### 5.88",

        "question": "p runs 20 % faster than q so p gives q a 300 meter head start. if the race ends in a tie, how far (in meters) did p run in the race?",
        "solution": "Let x be the distance q ran in the race.\nThen p ran x + 300 meters in the race.\nSince p runs 20% faster than q, p ran 1.2x meters in the same time that q ran x meters.\nTherefore, 1.2x = x + 300.\nSolving for x, we get x = 375.\nSo p ran x + 300 = 375 + 300 = 675 meters in the race.\n#### 675",

        "solution": "Let x be the time taken to cover the same distance with an increased speed of 5 km/hr.\nSpeed = Distance/Time\n60 = Distance/65\nDistance = 60 * 65 = 3900 km\nWith an increased speed of 5 km/hr, the speed of the bus will be 60 + 5 = 65 km/hr.\n65 = 3900/x\nx = 3900/65 = 60 minutes\n#### 60",
