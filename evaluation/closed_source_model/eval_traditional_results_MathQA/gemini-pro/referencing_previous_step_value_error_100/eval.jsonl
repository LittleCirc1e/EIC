{"question": "the distance from city a to city b is 60 miles . while driving from city a to city b , bob drives at a constant speed of 40 miles per hour . alice leaves city a 30 minutes after bob . what is the minimum constant speed in miles per hour that alice must exceed in order to arrive in city b before bob ?", "solution": "Bob drives 40 miles per hour, so he takes 60 / 40 = 1.5 hours to get to city b.\nSince Alice leaves 30 minutes after Bob, she has 1.5 - 0.5 = 1 hour to get to city b.\nTo find the minimum speed Alice must drive, we can set up the equation:\ndistance = speed * time\n60 = speed * 1\nspeed = 60\nTherefore, Alice must drive at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour to arrive in city b before Bob.\n#### 60", "answer": 60, "correct": 60.0}
{"question": "Two trains of length 160 m and 280 m are running towards each other on parallel lines at 42 kmph and 30 kmph respectively. In what time will they be clear of each other from the moment they meet?", "solution": "First, convert the speeds from kmph to m/s:\n42 kmph = 42 * 1000 / 60 / 60 = 11.67 m/s\n30 kmph = 30 * 1000 / 60 / 60 = 8.33 m/s\n\nThe total length of the two trains is 160 m + 280 m = 440 m.\n\nThe relative speed of the two trains is 11.67 m/s + 8.33 m/s = 20 m/s.\n\nThe time it takes for the two trains to be clear of each other is 440 m / 20 m/s = 22 seconds.\n#### 22", "answer": 22, "correct": 22.0}
{"question": "The sum of the squares of 3 numbers is 252 and the sum of their products taken two at a time is 116. Find the sum?", "solution": "Let the three numbers be x, y, and z.\nThen, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 252 and xy + xz + yz = 116.\nWe can use the identity (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + xz + yz) to find the value of (x + y + z)^2.\n(x + y + z)^2 = 252 + 2(116) = 484.\nTherefore, x + y + z = sqrt(484) = 22.\nHence, the sum of the three numbers is 22.\n#### 22", "answer": 22, "correct": 22.0}
{"question": "the area of a square is equal to five times the area of a rectangle of dimensions 25 cm * 5 cm. what is the perimeter of the square?", "solution": "Let x be the side length of the square.\nThe area of the square is x^2.\nThe area of the rectangle is 25 * 5 = 125 cm^2.\nSince the area of the square is five times the area of the rectangle, we have x^2 = 5 * 125 = 625.\nTherefore, x = sqrt(625) = 25 cm.\nThe perimeter of the square is 4 * 25 = 100 cm.\n#### 100", "answer": 100, "correct": 100.0}
{"question": "a metallic sheet is of rectangular shape with dimensions 48 m x 36 m. From each of its corners, a square is cut off so as to make an open box.

{"question": "fresh grapes contain 85 % water by weight and raisins obtained by drying fresh grapes contain 25 % water by weight. how many kgs of fresh grapes are needed to get 20 kgs of raisins?", "solution": "Let x be the number of kgs of fresh grapes needed.\nThe amount of water in x kgs of fresh grapes is 0.85x kgs.\nThe amount of water in 20 kgs of raisins is 0.25 * 20 = 5 kgs.\nSince the amount of water in the fresh grapes is equal to the amount of water in the raisins, we can set up the equation 0.85x = 5.\nSolving for x, we get x = 5 / 0.85 = 5.88.\n#### 5.88", "answer": 5.88, "correct": 100.0}
{"question": "p runs 20 % faster than q so p gives q a 300 meter head start. if the race ends in a tie, how far (in meters) did p run in the race?", "solution": "Let x be the distance q ran in the race.\nThen p ran x + 300 meters in the race.\nSince p runs 20% faster than q, p ran 1.2x meters in the same time that q ran x meters.\nTherefore, 1.2x = x + 300.\nSolving for x, we get x = 375.\nSo p ran x + 300 = 375 + 300 = 675 meters in the race.\n#### 675", "answer": 675, "correct": 1800.0}
