        "solution": "The card decreased in value by 20% in the first year, so it was worth 100% - 20% = 80% of its original value.\nIn the second year, it decreased in value by 10% of its new value, which was 80% of its original value. So, it was worth 80% - 10% of 80% = 80% - 8% = 72% of its original value.\nThe total percent decrease is 100% - 72% = 28%.\n#### 28",
