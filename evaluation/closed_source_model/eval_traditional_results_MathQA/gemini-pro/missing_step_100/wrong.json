        "solution": "Let x be the smaller integer.\nThen the larger integer is x + 3.\nThe difference of their cubes is (x + 3)^3 - x^3 = 189.\nExpanding the cube, we get x^3 + 27x^2 + 27x + 27 - x^3 = 189.\nSimplifying, we get 27x^2 + 27x - 162 = 0.\nFactoring, we get (3x - 14)(9x + 12) = 0.\nSetting each factor to 0, we get 3x - 14 = 0 or 9x + 12 = 0.\nSolving for x, we get x = 14/3 or x = -12/9.\nSince x is a positive integer, we have x = 14/3 = 4.66666666667.\nTherefore, the larger integer is x + 3 = 4.66666666667 + 3 = 7.66666666667.\nThe sum of the two integers is 4.66666666667 + 7.66666666667 = 12.3333333333.\n#### 12.3333333333",
