Let's correct it.\nWe should have (60 - 20) as the difference in distance traveled in the x minutes of stoppage.\nSo, the correct equation is:\n60 - (20/60)x = 20\nSolving for x, we get:\n(20/60)x = 60 - 20\n(20/60)x = 40\nx = 40 / (20/60)\nx = 40 * (60/20)\nx = 40 * 3\nx = 120\nAgain, we need to convert this to minutes per hour, so:\nx = 120 / 60\nx = 2 hours is incorrect as we need minutes. The correct conversion is:\nx = 120 minutes\nSince we are looking for stoppage time per hour, we need to subtract the moving time from the total time, which is 60 minutes.\nSo, the bus stops for 60 - 40 = 20 minutes per hour.\n#### 20",
