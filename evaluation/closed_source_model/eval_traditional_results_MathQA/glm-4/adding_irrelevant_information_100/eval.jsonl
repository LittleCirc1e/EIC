{"question": "On a certain test, Bill scored 20 more points than John, but half as many points as Sue. If the sum of the scores of the 3 students was 160 points, how many points did Bill receive?", "solution": "Let J be John's score. Then Bill's score is J + 20.\nLet S be Sue's score. Then Bill's score is S/2.\nWe know that J + (J + 20) + S = 160.\nThis simplifies to 2J + S = 140.\nSince Bill's score is both J + 20 and S/2, then we set them equal: J + 20 = S/2.\nNow we solve for S in terms of J: S = 2J + 40.\nSubstituting this back into 2J + S = 140, we get 2J + (2J + 40) = 140.\nThis simplifies to 4J = 100.\nSo J = 25, which means Bill's score is 25 + 20 = 45.\n#### 45", "answer": 45, "correct": 45.0}
{"question": "A towel, when bleached, lost 20% of its length and 20% of its breadth.
