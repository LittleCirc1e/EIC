        "solution": "There are 4 Sundays in a 30-day month beginning with a Sunday.\nSo, the total visitors on Sundays are 4 * 510 = 2040\nThere are 26 other days in the month (30 - 4 = 26)\nSo, the total visitors on other days are 26 * 240 = 6240\nThe total number of visitors in the month are 2040 + 6240 = 8280\nThe average number of visitors per day is 8280 / 30 = 276\n#### 276",

        "question": "The average temperature for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday was 52 °C. The average temperature for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday was 54 °C. If the temperature on Friday was 53 °C, what was the temperature on Tuesday?",
        "solution": "Let T be the temperature on Tuesday and W, Th, F be the temperatures on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday respectively.\nWe know that (T + W + Th) / 3 = 52\nWe also know that (W + Th + F) / 3 = 54\nAnd we are given that F = 53\nSubstituting F in the second equation, we get (W + Th + 53) / 3 = 54\nThis means W + Th = 54*3 - 53 = 159 - 53 = 106\nNow we can substitute W + Th in the first equation\n(T + 106) / 3 = 52\nThis simplifies to T + 106 = 52*3 = 156\nFinally, T = 156 - 106 = 50\n#### 50",

        "solution": "There are 4 weeks and 2 extra days in the month.\nSince the month starts on a Saturday, the 2 extra days are Sunday and Monday.\nThere are 5 working days in a week (Monday to Friday).\nIn 4 weeks, there are 4 x 5 = 20 working days.\nThe first Saturday is not a holiday, but the second Saturday is a holiday, so we subtract 1 from the 2 extra days.\nThere is 1 working day in the 2 extra days (Monday).\nSo, the total working days are 20 + 1 = 21.\n#### 21",
