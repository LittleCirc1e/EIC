{"question": "One week, a certain truck rental lot had a total of 18 trucks, all of which were on the lot Monday morning. If 50% of the trucks that were rented out during the week were returned to the lot on or before Saturday morning of that week, and if there were at least 12 trucks on the lot that Saturday morning, what is the greatest number of different trucks that could have been rented out during the week?", "solution": "Let R be the number of trucks rented out during the week.\n50% of the trucks were returned, so 0.5R trucks were back on Saturday morning.\nThere were at least 12 trucks on Saturday morning, so 18 - R + 0.5R >= 12.\nThis simplifies to 0.5R >= 12 - 18.\n0.5R >= -6.\nR <= 6 / 0.5.\nR <= 12.\nSince R must be an integer, the greatest number of trucks that could have been rented out is less than or equal to 12.\nBut we need the greatest number, so we take R = 12.\nHowever, 50% of 12 is 6, and if 6 were returned, we would only have 12 - 6 = 6 trucks on the lot, which is not at least 12.\nSo we must subtract 1 from R to ensure there are at least 12 trucks on the lot Saturday morning.\nTherefore, the greatest number of different trucks that could have been rented out is 11.\n#### 11", "answer": 11, "correct": 12}
