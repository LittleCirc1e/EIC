{"question": "Along a yard 434 metres long, 32 trees are planted at equal distances, one tree being at each end of the yard. What is the distance between two consecutive trees?", "solution": "Since there is one tree at each end, there are 32 - 1 = 31 gaps between the trees.\nTo find the distance between two consecutive trees, we divide the total length of the yard by the number of gaps.\nSo, the distance between two consecutive trees is 434 / 31 = 14 metres.\n#### 14", "answer": 14, "correct": 14.0}
{"question": "Jane and Thomas are among the 9 people from which a committee of 4 people is to be selected.
