        "question": "A baseball card decreased in value 20% in its first year and 10% in its second year. What was the total percent decrease of the card's value over the two years?",
        "solution": "Let the original value of the card be $100.\nIn the first year, the card's value decreased by 20%, so it is now worth 100 - (20% of 100) = 100 - 20 = 80.\nIn the second year, the card's value decreased by 10%, so it is now worth 80 - (10% of 80) = 80 - 8 = 72.\nThe total decrease over two years is 100 - 72 = 28.\nTo find the total percent decrease, we divide the total decrease by the original value and multiply by 100: (28/100) * 100 = 28%\n#### 28%",

        "question": "The consumption of diesel per hour of a bus varies directly as square of its speed. When the bus is travelling at 70 kmph its consumption is 1 litre per hour. If each litre costs $70 and other expenses per hour is $70, then what would be the minimum expenditure required to cover a distance of 700 km?",
        "solution": "Let the speed of the bus be v kmph and its consumption be C litres per hour. Given that C ∝ v^2.\nAt v = 70 kmph, C = 1 litre per hour. So, C = k * v^2 where k is the constant of proportionality.\nFrom the given information, k = 1/70^2 = 1/4900.\nSo, C = (1/4900) * v^2.\nTo cover a distance of 700 km, the time taken t = distance/speed = 700/v hours.\nThe total diesel consumption for the journey is C * t = (1/4900) * v^2 * (700/v) = 700/70 = 10 litres.\nThe cost of diesel is 10 litres * $70/litre = $700.\nOther expenses per hour are $70, so for t hours, it would be $70 * t = $70 * (700/v).\nTotal minimum expenditure E = cost of diesel + other expenses = $700 + $70 * (700/v).\nTo minimize the expenditure, we need to find the minimum value of v such that C is minimum, which occurs when v is minimum.\nSince the consumption varies directly with the square of the speed, the minimum speed that makes sense is the speed at which the consumption is minimum, which is the speed given, 70 kmph.\nAt this speed, the other expenses are $70 * (700/70) = $700.\nSo, the total minimum expenditure E = $700 (diesel) + $700 (other expenses) = $1400.\n#### 1400",

        "solution": "Let h be the height of the trapezoid.\nWe can divide the trapezoid into a rectangle and two right triangles by drawing an altitude from the vertex of the isosceles trapezoid to the base.\nThe height of each right triangle is h, and the base of each is (12 - 6)/2 = 3.\nThe length of the rectangle is the average of the two bases, which is (6 + 12)/2 = 9.\nUsing Pythagorean theorem, we get h^2 + 3^2 = 5^2\nTherefore, h^2 = 25 - 9 = 16\nSo, h = 4 (since the height cannot be negative)\nThe area of the trapezoid is (sum of the bases * height) / 2 = (6 + 12) * 4 / 2 = 18 * 2 = 36\n#### 36",
