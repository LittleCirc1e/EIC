        "solution": "Let the total worth of the stock be Rs. x.\n10% of the stock is sold at a profit, which is 0.10x.\nThe profit on this is 20%, so the profit amount is 0.20 * 0.10x = 0.02x.\nThe remaining 90% of the stock is sold at a loss, which is 0.90x.\nThe loss on this is 5%, so the loss amount is 0.05 * 0.90x = 0.045x.\nOverall, the loss is Rs. 400, so 0.02x - 0.045x = -400.\nThis simplifies to -0.025x = -400.\nDividing both sides by -0.025 gives x = 400 / 0.025.\n#### 16000",
