        "question": "A salesmanâ€™s terms were changed from a flat commission of 5% on all his sales to a fixed salary of Rs. 1000 plus 2.5% commission on all sales exceeding Rs. 4,000. If his remuneration as per the new scheme was Rs. 600 more than that by the previous scheme, his sales were worth",
        "solution": "Let the total sales be x.\nUnder the old scheme, his commission was 5% of x, which is 0.05x.\nUnder the new scheme, he gets a fixed salary of Rs. 1000 plus 2.5% commission on sales exceeding Rs. 4,000.\nSo, if x > 4000, the additional commission is (x - 4000) * 0.025.\nHis total remuneration under the new scheme is 1000 + (x - 4000) * 0.025.\nAccording to the problem, the new remuneration is Rs. 600 more than the old remuneration, so:\n1000 + (x - 4000) * 0.025 = 0.05x + 600\nSolving for x, we get:\nx - 4000 = (0.05x + 600 - 1000) / 0.025\nx - 4000 = (0.05x - 400) / 0.025\n0.025x - 100 = 0.05x - 400\n400 - 100 = 0.05x - 0.025x\n300 = 0.025x\nx = 300 / 0.025\nx = 12000\n#### 12000",

        "question": "Rice weighing 29 / 4 pounds was divided equally and placed in 4 containers. How many ounces of rice were in each container? (Note that 1 pound = 16 ounces)",
        "solution": "The total weight of rice is 29/4 pounds.\nDividing this equally among 4 containers, each container gets (29/4) / 4 pounds of rice.\nThis is (29/4) * (1/4) = 29 / 16 pounds of rice per container.\nSince 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, each container has (29/16) * 16 ounces of rice.\n#### 29",

        "solution": "Let the revenue of company n in 1998 be $100.\nProfits in 1998 were 10% of revenue, so profits in 1998 were $100 * 10% = $10.\nIn 1999, the revenue fell by 30%, so the revenue in 1999 was $100 - (30% * $100) = $70.\nProfits in 1999 were 10% of the new revenue, so profits in 1999 were $70 * 10% = $7.\nTo find the percentage of profits in 1999 compared to 1998, we do ($7 / $10) * 100 = 70%\n#### 70",
