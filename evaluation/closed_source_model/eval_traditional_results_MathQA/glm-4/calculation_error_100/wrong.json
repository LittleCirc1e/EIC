        "question": "Two cars are driving towards one another. The first car is traveling at a speed of 120 km/h, which is 28% faster than the second car. If the distance between the cars is 855 km, how long will it take the cars to meet (in hours)?",
        "solution": "The first car's speed is 28% faster than the second car, which means the second car is traveling at 100% - 28% = 72% of the first car's speed.\nThis is equivalent to 0.72 * 120 km/h = 86.4 km/h for the second car.\nWhen both cars are driving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds: 120 km/h + 86.4 km/h = 206.4 km/h.\nTo find out how long it will take for them to meet, we divide the total distance by their relative speed: 855 km / 206.4 km/h.\n#### 4.147705078125",

        "question": "circular gears l and r start to rotate at the same time at the same rate. gear l makes 20 complete revolutions per minute and gear r makes 40 revolutions per minute. how many seconds after the gears start to rotate will gear r have made exactly 6 more revolutions than gear l?",
        "solution": "The difference in the rate of revolution between gear r and gear l is 40 - 20 = 20 revolutions per minute.\nTo find out when gear r will be 6 revolutions ahead of gear l, we need to find the time it takes for gear r to make 6 more revolutions than gear l at a rate of 20 revolutions per minute.\nThis is equivalent to 6/20 minutes or 0.3 minutes since 6 divided by 20 is 0.3.\n0.3 minutes is equal to 0.3 * 60 seconds which is 18 seconds.\n#### 18",

        "question": "A 230 m long train running at the speed of 120 km/hr crosses another train running in the opposite direction at the speed of 80 km/hr in 9 sec. What is the length of the other train?",
        "solution": "First convert the speeds from km/hr to m/s:\n120 km/hr = 120 * 1000 / 3600 = 33.33 m/s\n80 km/hr = 80 * 1000 / 3600 = 22.22 m/s\n\nThe relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds:\nRelative speed = 33.33 m/s + 22.22 m/s = 55.55 m/s\n\nThe time taken to cross is given as 9 seconds.\n\nThe distance covered is the product of the relative speed and the time taken to cross:\nDistance = Relative speed * Time = 55.55 m/s * 9 s = 499.95 m\n\nThe distance covered is the sum of the lengths of the two trains:\nLength of other train = Distance - Length of first train\nLength of other train = 499.95 m - 230 m = 269.95 m\n#### 269.95",

        "solution": "Let the width of the wall be w.\nThen, the height of the wall is 6w and the length of the wall is 7(6w) = 42w.\nThe volume of the wall is w * 6w * 42w = 252w^3.\nWe know that the volume is 129024 cu. m., so we have 252w^3 = 129024.\nDividing both sides by 252, we get w^3 = 129024 / 252 = 510.\nTaking the cube root of both sides, we get w = ∛510 ≈ 7.93725.\n#### 7.93725",
