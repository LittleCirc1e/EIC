If 3 builders take 8 days, then one builder would take 3 times longer, which is 24 days. Therefore, 6 builders would take 24 divided by 6, which is 4 days, to build the cottage. However, the solution incorrectly states the final answer as 5 days instead of 4 days. The explanation is correct, but the final calculation is wrong."
