        "question": "A rancher owns a mixture of 8 sheep and 5 cattle that graze on his land. In a typical year, the rancher will allow his animals to feed off his pastures for as long as possible before they run out of grass. After the pastures run out of grass, he must buy feed corn for $10 per bag. Each cow eats 2 acres of grass per month, and each sheep eats 1 acre of grass per month. Additionally, a bag of feed corn can feed each cow for 1 month and each sheep for 2 months. If the rancher's pasture contains 144 acres of grass, how much will the rancher need to spend on feed corn to feed his animals each year?",

        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the number of plates removed from the box.\nHasan figured out the movers' weight limit was 20 pounds. Since a pound is equal to 16 ounces, each box can hold 20 * 16, or 320 ounces.\nEach plate weighs 10 ounces, so the weight of the plates in the box after Hasan removes enough plates to satisfy the movers' weight limit is (38 - x) * 10 ounces\nSince these two values are equal, we can write the equation (38 - x) * 10 = 320.\nDividing both sides by 10 leaves 38-x = 32.\nAdding x to both sides gives 38 – x + x = 32 +x, or, 38 = 32 +x\nSubtracting 32 from both sides gives the value of x, which is the number of plates removed from the box, 38 -32 = 32 + x – 32, or, 5 = x\n#### 5",
