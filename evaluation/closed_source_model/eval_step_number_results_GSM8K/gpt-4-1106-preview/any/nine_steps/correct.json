        "any_explanation": "The solution incorrectly calculates the number of highlighters Sam took from the 5 boxes to make packages. It should be 5 boxes * 30 highlighters/box = 150 highlighters, not 30. Consequently, the number of packages he made is 150 highlighters / 6 highlighters/package = 25 packages, not 5. He sold these 25 packages for 25 * $3 = $75, not $15. The correct number of remaining highlighters is 360 - 150 = 210 highlighters, not 330. These form 210 / 3 = 70 groups of three pens. He sold each of these groups for $2 each, so made 70 * 2 = $140 from them, not $200. In total, he earned $75 + $140 = $215. The profit is $215 - $120 = $95, which is the only correct part of the solution."
