        "question": "A jar on the family's counter contains change they've been saving a trip to the ice cream shop. There are 123 pennies, 85 nickels, 35 dimes, and a number of quarters. All five family members get a double scoop, which costs $3 each. After the trip, they have 48 cents left over. How many quarters were in the jar?",
        "original_solution": "The family spent $15 on ice cream because 5 x 3 = 15\nThey total amount of change they had was $15.48 because 15 + .48 = 15.48\nThey have $1.23 in pennies because 123 x .01 = 1.23\nThey have $4.25 in nickels because 85 x .05 = 4.25\nThey have $3.50 in dimes because 35 x .1 = 3.5\nWithout the quarters they have a total of $8.98 because 1.23 + 4.25 + 3.5 = 8.98\nThey have $6.5 worth of quarters because 15.48-8.98 = 6.5\nThey have 26 quarters because 6.5 / .25 = 26\n#### 26",

        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates the total without quarters as $9.98 instead of $8.98 in step 6, which affects subsequent step 7 and 8 related to it. Step 7 inherits the error from step 6, modifying the formula 15.48-8.98 = 6.5 to 15.48-9.98 = 5.5. Step 8 inherits the error from step 7, modifying the calculation 6.5 / .25 = 26 to 5.5 / .25 = 22. It should be noted that you only need to pay attention to one calculation error, and the subsequent related steps to this wrong step will only inherit its error, which means the relevant numbers in the formula or language description inherit the error, but the calculation of the formula itself is still correct.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the total amount spent on ice cream, the total amount of change in the jar, and the value of the pennies, nickels, and dimes. It then correctly subtracts the value of the pennies, nickels, and dimes from the total to find the value of the quarters and finally divides by the value of a quarter to find the number of quarters."
