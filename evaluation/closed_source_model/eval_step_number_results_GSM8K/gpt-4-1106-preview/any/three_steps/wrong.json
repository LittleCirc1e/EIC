        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates the total cost as $85 + $22 = $105 instead of $85 + $22 = $107 in step 3. The error in step 3 does not affect the previous steps 1 and 2, which remain correct. The transformed solution only contains a single error in the final addition step, and the transformed answer reflects this incorrect calculation.",
