        "question": "James needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter. Each dog needs one toy. James currently has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs, but there are 8 more dogs in the shelter now. After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left so he had to buy some more toys. When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone so he no longer needed those toys. How many toys in total does James need?",
        "original_solution": "James has 4+8=12 toys.\nThere were 12*2=24 dogs.\nJames needed to buy 24-12=12 more toys.\nThere are 36 total toys.\n36-3=33 toys are now needed.\n#### 33",

        "transformed_solution": "James has 4+8=12 toys.\nThere were 12*2=24 dogs.\nJames needed to buy 24-12=12 more toys.\nThere are 36 total toys.\n36-3=30 toys are now needed.\n#### 30",

        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates 36-3 as 30 instead of 36-3=33 in step 5. This is the first transformation and changes only the operation of this step. Steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 are unaffected, as the error is only in step 5, which is a calculation error where a wrong result was derived from the correct operands in the formula.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.\n8 more dogs arrive, so he needs 4+8=12 toys.\nTwice as many more dogs arrive, so there are now 12+12=24 dogs in total.\nJames needs 24 toys for 24 dogs.\nHe already has 4 toys, so he needs to buy 24-4=20 more toys.\n3 dogs leave, so he now needs 24-3=21 toys in total.\nJames needs to buy 21-4=17 more toys.",
        "corrected_answer": 17.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "James initially has enough toys for the current dogs. When 8 more dogs arrive, he needs 8 more toys. Then, twice as many more dogs arrive, making the total 24 dogs. He needs 24 toys in total. After buying enough toys for 24 dogs and subtracting the 4 he already has, he needs to buy 20 more. When 3 dogs leave, he needs 21 toys in total. Therefore, he needs to buy 17 more toys to have one for each dog."

        "question": "Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day. This means that each hour the AC uses 900 watts of energy. If he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, how many kilowatts of electric energy will he save in 30 days?",
        "original_solution": "An air conditioner uses 900 x 8 = 7200 watts for 8 hours a day.\nAn air conditioner uses 900 x 5 = 4500 watts for 5 hours a day.\nSo, Mel saves 7200 - 4500 = 2700 watts per day.\nThat is 2700/1000 = 2.7 kilowatts per day since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts.\nHence, in 30 days he will have 2.7 x 30 = 81 kilowatts of electric energy saved.\n#### 81",

        "corrected_solution": "An air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.\nBy reducing the usage by 5 hours a day, Mel saves 900 x 5 = 4500 watts per day.\nTo convert watts to kilowatts, divide by 1000. So, Mel saves 4500/1000 = 4.5 kilowatts per day.\nOver 30 days, Mel will save 4.5 x 30 = 135 kilowatts of electric energy.\n",
        "corrected_answer": 135.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly subtracted the energy used for 5 hours from the energy used for 8 hours, instead of calculating the savings directly from the reduction of 5 hours. The correct calculation is to find the energy saved per day by not using the air conditioner for 5 hours and then multiply that by 30 days to find the total energy saved in kilowatts."
