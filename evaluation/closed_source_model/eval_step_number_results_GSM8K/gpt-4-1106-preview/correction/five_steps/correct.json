The correct process is to add up all the taxes paid and the take-home salary to find the gross salary. The income tax is 10% of the gross salary, so the equation to solve for the gross salary is g - 0.10g = $40,000 + $5,000. Solving this equation gives us the correct gross salary of $50,000."

        "question": "Tomas ate 1.5 pounds of chocolate fudge last week. Katya ate half a pound of peanut butter fudge, while Boris ate 2 pounds of fudge. How many ounces of fudge did the 3 friends eat in total?",
        "original_solution": "Tomas ate 1.5 * 16 = 24 ounces\nKatya ate 0.5 * 16 = 8 ounces\nBoris ate 2 * 16 = 32 ounces\nTotal = 24 + 8 + 32 = 64 ounces\nThe 3 friends ate 64 ounces of fudge in total.\n#### 64",
        "original_answer": 64.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Tomas ate 1.5 * 16 = 24 ounces\nKatya ate 0.5 * 16 = 8 ounces\nBoris ate 2 * 16 = 30 ounces\nTotal = 24 + 8 + 30 = 62 ounces\nThe 3 friends ate 62 ounces of fudge in total.\n#### 62",

        "wrong_step": 3,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The example mistakenly calculates 2 * 16 as 30 ounces instead of 32 ounces in step 3. This error affects the total calculation in step 4, which changes from 24 + 8 + 32 = 64 ounces to 24 + 8 + 30 = 62 ounces. The transformed answer is therefore 62 ounces instead of the correct 64 ounces. The previous steps 1 and 2 remain unchanged as they are not affected by the error in step 3. The calculation error is only in one step, and the subsequent related step inherits this error, but the calculation within the step itself is correct.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Tomas ate 1.5 * 16 = 24 ounces\nKatya ate 0.5 * 16 = 8 ounces\nBoris ate 2 * 16 = 32 ounces\nTotal = 24 + 8 + 32 = 64 ounces\nThe 3 friends ate 64 ounces of fudge in total.",
        "corrected_answer": 64.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The error was in the calculation of the ounces of fudge Boris ate. The correct calculation is 2 pounds * 16 ounces per pound = 32 ounces, not 30 ounces. After correcting this, the total should be 24 + 8 + 32 = 64 ounces."
