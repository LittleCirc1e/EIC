        "question": "A tree had 1000 leaves before the onset of the dry season, when it sheds all its leaves. In the first week of the dry season, the tree shed 2/5 of the leaves. In the second week, it shed 40% of the remaining leaves. In the third week, the tree shed 3/4 times as many leaves as it shed in the second week. Calculate the number of leaves the tree had not shed by the third week.",
        "original_solution": "In the first week, the tree shed 2/5*1000 = 400 leaves.\nThe number of leaves remaining on the tree at the end of the first week is 1000-400 = 600\nIn the second week, the tree shed 40/100*600 = 240 leaves.\nThe number of leaves remaining on the tree is 600-240 = 360\nIn the third week, the tree shed 3/4 of its leaves, a total of 3/4*360 = 270 leaves.\nThe number of leaves remaining on the tree is 360-270 = 90 leaves.\n#### 90",

        "explanation": "In this case, step 4 incorrectly calculates the number of leaves the tree shed in the third week as 3/4*360 = 260 leaves instead of the correct 270 leaves. The subsequent step 5 uses the incorrect result of step 4 to calculate the number of leaves remaining on the tree which should be 360-260 = 100 leaves, rather than the correct calculation of 360-270 = 90 leaves. The transformed answer of 100 is thus based on the incorrect intermediate result in step 4, manifesting as the single calculation error in the transformed solution.",

To get from one floor to the next, drivers have to drive 800 feet at 10 feet/second. How long, in seconds, does it take to get to the bottom of the garage from the top?",
        "original_solution": "First find the total number of gates someone has to pass through: 12 floors / 3 floors/gate = 4 gates\nThen find the total time someone spends waiting at the gates: 4 gates * 2 minutes/gate = 8 minutes\nThen convert that time to seconds: 8 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 480 seconds\nThen find the time to drive through one floor in seconds: 800 feet / 10 feet/second = 80 seconds\nThen multiply the time per floor by the number of floors to find the total driving time: 80 seconds/floor * 12 floors = 960 seconds\nThen add the total driving time to the total time waiting at the gates to find the total time to get to the bottom: 960 seconds + 480 seconds = 1440 seconds\n#### 1440",
