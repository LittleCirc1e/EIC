        "question": "In a section of the forest, there are 100 weasels and 50 rabbits. Three foxes invade this region and hunt the rodents. Each fox catches an average of 4 weasels and 2 rabbits per week. How many rabbits and weasels will be left after 3 weeks?",
        "original_solution": "3 foxes catch 4 weasels each every week for a total of 3*4 = 12 weasels\n12 weasels are caught every week for 3 weeks for a total of 12*3 = 36 weasels\n3 foxes catch 2 rabbits each every week for a total of 3*2 = 6 rabbits\n6 rabbits are caught every week for 3 weeks for a total of 6*3 = 18 rabbits\nThere were originally 100 weasels so now there are 100-36 = 64 weasels left\nThere were originally 50 rabbits so now there are 50-18 = 32 rabbits left\nThere are 64+32 = 96 weasels and rabbits left\n#### 96",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates 50-18 as 34 instead of 50-18=32 in step 5, which affects the final step 7. Step 7 inherits the error from step 5, modifying 64+32=96 to 64+34=98. It should be noted that you only need to pay attention to one calculation error, and the subsequent related steps to this wrong step will only inherit its error, which means the relevant numbers in the formula or language description inherit the error, but the calculation of the formula itself is still correct.",

        "corrected_answer": 32.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The calculation of the number of weasels and rabbits caught by the foxes is correct, but the final addition of the remaining weasels and rabbits is not necessary, and the subtraction for the rabbits was incorrect. After 3 weeks, there will be 64 weasels and 32 rabbits left, not 34 rabbits as stated in the original solution."

        "question": "A wild tiger escapes the zoo.  He escapes at 1 AM and zookeepers do not notice he is missing until 4 AM.  He runs at a speed of 25 mph.  It takes 2 more hours to find him but after 4 hours of running, the tiger slows his speed to 10 mph.  He then gets chased for half an hour going 50 mph.  How far away from the zoo was he caught?",
        "original_solution": "He was running for 4-1=3 hours\nSo in that time he runs 3*25=75 miles\nSince he slowed down after 4 hours, the time he spent running at 25mph was an additional 4-3=1 hours\nSo in the first hour they were finding him, he ran 1*25=25 miles\nIn the second hour they were finding him, he ran 1*10=10 miles\nFinally, during the chase, he ran 50*.5=25 miles\nSo he is 75+25+10+25=135 miles away\n#### 135",

The previous steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 remain unchanged because they are not related to the error introduced in step 5.

        "corrected_explanation": "The tiger runs at 25 mph for the first 3 hours, then slows to 10 mph for the next 2 hours, not 1 hour as stated in the original solution. The chase at 50 mph for half an hour is correct. The total distance should be calculated by adding the distance covered in each phase: 75 miles at 25 mph, 20 miles at 10 mph, and 25 miles at 50 mph during the chase."
