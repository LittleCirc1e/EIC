The correct approach is to realize that since 4 apples cost the same as 1 watermelon, and we bought 12 apples and 3 watermelons (because 12 apples are equivalent to 3 sets of 4 apples), the total cost for apples and watermelons is 3 times the combined price of 4 apples and 1 watermelon.

Bella has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, so if she has 30 frisbees, she must have 30+20 = 50 deck cards, not 10. After buying 2/5 times more deck cards, she will have 2/5*50 = 20 more deck cards, making the total 50+20 = 70 deck cards. The total number of items after purchasing more will be 70 deck cards + 42 frisbees + 84 marbles = 196 items."

        "question": "Sam bought a dozen boxes, each with 30 highlighter pens inside, for $10 each box. He rearranged five of these boxes into packages of six highlighters each and sold them for $3 per package. He sold the rest of the highlighters separately at the rate of three pens for $2. How much profit did he make in total, in dollars?",
        "original_solution": "Sam bought 12 boxes x $10 = $120 worth of highlighters.\nHe bought 12 * 30 = 360 highlighters in total.\nSam then took 5 boxes × 6 highlighters/box = 30 highlighters.\nHe sold these boxes for 5 * $3 = $15\nAfter selling these 5 boxes there were 360 - 30 = 330 highlighters remaining.\nThese form 330 / 3 = 110 groups of three pens.\nHe sold each of these groups for $2 each, so made 110 * 2 = $220 from them.\nIn total, then, he earned $220 + $15 = $235.\nSince his original cost was $120, he earned $235 - $120 = $115 in profit.\n#### 115",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The error was introduced in step 6, where the division 330 / 3 was incorrectly calculated as 100 instead of 110. This error then affected the subsequent steps that relied on the result of step 6. Step 7 changed from 110 * 2 = $220 to 100 * 2 = $200, and step 8 changed from $220 + $15 = $235 to $200 + $15 = $215. Finally, step 9 changed from $235 - $120 = $115 to $215 - $120 = $95. The previous steps and unrelated steps were not affected by this error.",

        "corrected_answer": 95.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The error in the original solution was in the calculation of the number of highlighters in the 5 boxes that were rearranged. There are 30 highlighters per box, so 5 boxes contain 5 * 30 = 150 highlighters, not 30. These 150 highlighters were then sold in packages of 6, resulting in 25 packages, not 5. The rest of the solution is correct, and the final profit is indeed $95."
