The number of green grapes is represented by G, the red grapes are correctly expressed as 3G + 7, and the raspberries as G - 5. The equation G + 3G + 7 + G - 5 = 102 is properly simplified to 5G + 2 = 102, and then to 5G = 100, giving G = 20. Substituting G into the equation for red grapes gives 3 * 20 + 7 = 60, which is the correct number of red grapes in the salad."
