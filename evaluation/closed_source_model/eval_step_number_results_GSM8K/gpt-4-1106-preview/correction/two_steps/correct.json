        "original_solution": "Since humans have two legs, we start by finding out what double that amount is by performing 2*2=4\nSpiders have twice that number, so we multiply 4*2 to find 8 legs in total.\n#### 8",

        "transformed_solution": "Since humans have two legs, we start by finding out what double that amount is by performing 2*2=4\nSpiders have twice that number, so we multiply 4*2 to find 6 legs in total.\n#### 6",

        "corrected_solution": "Since humans have two legs, we start by finding out what double that amount is by performing 2*2=4.\nSpiders have two times more than this number, so we add 4 to itself which is 4+4 to find 8 legs in total.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly states that humans have two legs and then incorrectly calculates the number of spider legs based on that incorrect assumption. Humans actually have two legs, so doubling that would be 2*2=4. However, the question states that spiders have two times more than double the number of legs a human has, which means we need to add double the human leg count to itself: 4+4=8. Therefore, a spider has 8 legs."

Step 2 inherits the error from step 1, modifying the formula 30+9=$39 to 30+10=$40.

Then the number of girls is 3x.\nWe can set up the equation x + 3x = 100 to find the number of boys.\nCombining like terms, we get 4x = 100.\nDividing both sides by 4, we find x = 100 / 4 = 25.\nSo, there are 25 boys in the Biology class.",
