The solution rounds this to $800, which is a slight error, but then correctly adds the total interest to the original amount to find the final amount in the bank after two years, which is $5600 + $784 = $6384. The final answer is rounded to $6400, which is acceptable for financial calculations where cents are not considered. Therefore, the solution is essentially correct."
