In the first month of school, she misplaced 7 pencils, broke 3 pencils and had to throw them away, she found 4, and bought 2.  How many pencils did Autumn have left?",
        "original_solution": "Autumn misplaced 7 and broke 3, so that lost her 7+3 = 10 pencils\nAutumn found 4 pencils and bought 2, so she gained 4+2 = 6 pencils\nShe started with 20 pencils, lost 10 and gained 6 so she had 20-10+6 = 16 pencils left\n#### 16",

        "explanation": "In this example, the calculation of 4+2 in step 2 is incorrectly changed to 8 instead of the correct 6. This error affects the final calculation in step 3, where the original 20-10+6 is changed to 20-10+8, resulting in a transformed answer of 18 pencils instead of the correct 16 pencils. The error is isolated to step 2, and the subsequent step 3 inherits this error without affecting the previous step 1. The calculation within each step is still performed correctly, but the numbers used are based on the incorrect result from the erroneous step.",
