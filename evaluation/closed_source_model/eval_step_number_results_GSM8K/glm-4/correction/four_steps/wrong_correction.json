        "original_solution": "The smaller bags each have 100/2=50 gold coins each\nSo in total, they have 50*2=100 coins\nSo he found 100+100=200 coins\nSo he finds 200/8=25 coins an hour\n#### 25",

        "transformed_solution": "The smaller bags each have 100/2 = 50 gold coins each\nSo in total, they have 50*2 = 100 coins\nSo he found 100+100 = 200 coins\nSo he finds 200/8 = 20 coins an hour\n#### 20",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This transformed solution introduces a calculation error in step 4, where the division of the total gold coins found (200) by the number of hours spent scuba diving (8) is incorrectly calculated as 20 coins per hour instead of 25. This calculation error only occurs in step 4 and does not affect the correct calculation in steps 1, 2, and 3. The incorrect result is carried over to the transformed_answer, which is different from the original_answer.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "The smaller bags each have 100/2 = 50 gold coins each. So in total, they add 50+50 = 100 coins. Adding the chest's 100 coins, he found 100+100 = 150 coins. Therefore, he finds 150/8 = 18.75 coins an hour.",
        "corrected_answer": 18.75,
        "corrected_explanation": "The error in the original solution is that it adds the coins in the smaller bags twice. We should add them only once to the total from the treasure chest, then divide by the number of hours to find the gold found per hour."

        "original_solution": "She rode 1 hour every Monday, Wednesday and Friday each week so every week she rode 1*3 = 3 hours\nShe rode 30 min on Tuesday and Thursday each week for a total of 30*2 = 60 min or 1 hour\nOn Mon, Wed & Friday she rode 3 hours, 1 hour total on Tue and Thur and 2 hours on Sat for a total of 3+1+2 = 6 hours\nShe rode 6 hours per week for 2 weeks so in total she rode 6*2 = 12 hours\n#### 12",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This transformation changes the result of the last calculation from 6*2 = 12 to 6*2 = 11, which is a clear calculation error. The steps prior to this are unaffected, as the operands or operators of those steps have not been changed. Consequently, only step 4 in the original solution is altered to reflect this single calculation error, resulting in an answer of 11 hours instead of the correct 12 hours. The rest of the transformed solution must be accurately derived from the incorrect product of this wrong step.",

        "corrected_solution": "She rode 1 hour every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday each week so every week she rode 1*3 = 3 hours. She rode 30 min on Tuesday and Thursday each week for a total of 0.5*2 = 1 hour. In a week, she rides 3 hours from Mon, Wed, and Fri, 1 hour on Tue and Thur, and 2 hours on Sat for a total of 3+1+1+2 = 7 hours. She rode 7 hours per week for 2 weeks so in total she rode 7*2 = 14 hours.",
        "corrected_answer": 14.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The initial calculation did not correctly add the hours for Tuesday and Thursday, and also did not add the hours correctly over the two-week period. The corrected solution properly calculates the time Bethany rides each day and then sums it up correctly for one week and then multiplies by two for the two-week period."

        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates 160+40 as 210 instead of 200 in step 3, which affects the subsequent step 4 related to it. Step 4 inherits the error from step 3, modifying the formula 2*200=400 birds to 2*210=420 birds. The previous steps 1 and 2 are not affected by this error and remain unchanged. It should be noted that only one calculation error is introduced, and the subsequent related steps will inherit this error, which means the relevant numbers in the formula or language description inherit the error, but the calculation of the formula itself is still correct.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "The number of trees is three times the number of stones, meaning there are 3*40 = 120 trees in the courtyard. Combined, there are 120+40 = 160 trees and stones. Since the number of birds is twice the combined number of trees and stones, there are 2*(120+40) = 320 birds in the trees.",
        "corrected_answer": 320.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The original solution incorrectly added the number of stones to the number of trees that is already three times the number of stones, instead of just calculating the number of trees as three times the number of stones. The correct approach is to first find the number of trees (3*40), then add that to the number of stones to find the combined total, and finally double that combined total for the number of birds."
