        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates $30/2 as $10 instead of $30/2 as $15 in step 3, which affects the subsequent step 4 related to it. Step 4 inherits the error from step 3, modifying $20-$15 = $5 to $20-$10 = $10. It should be noted that you only need to pay attention to one calculation error, and the subsequent related steps to this wrong step will only inherit its error, which means the relevant numbers in the formula or language description inherit the error, but the calculation of the formula itself is still correct.",

        "corrected_solution": "40% of $50 is (40/100)*$50 = $20. After Moses takes $20, there will be $50-$20 = $30 left. Tony and Esther will split $30 equally among themselves so each of them will get $30/2 = $15. Moses gets $20-$15 = $5 more than Esther.",
        "corrected_answer": 5.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The mistake in the original solution is that it incorrectly calculates the amount each of Tony and Esther receives. They should each get $15, not $10. Therefore, Moses gets $5 more than Esther, not $10."
