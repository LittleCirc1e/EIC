Then, since Bill pays 10% of his gross salary in income taxes, his net salary after income tax is 90% of his gross salary. We can represent this as: .9 * g = $40,000 (take-home salary).

Instead, we should subtract the total taxes paid from the net salary to find the salary before income tax, then use the retention percentage to find the gross salary. The correct calculation is: $40,000 / .9 = $44,444.44."

The saving is then 7200 watts - 2700 watts = 4500 watts per day. To convert this to kilowatts, we divide by 1000, so the saving is 4500 watts / 1000 = 4.5 kilowatts per day.
