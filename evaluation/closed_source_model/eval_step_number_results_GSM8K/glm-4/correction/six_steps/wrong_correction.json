        "explanation": "In the transformed_solution, the calculation in step 3 is purposefully made incorrect, changing the result of 3x from 48 to 50. This error propagates through the rest of the solution without altering the original formula structure. The subsequent steps inherit the erroneous result of step 3, where step 4 calculates x as '50 / 3 = 16.67 books' instead of the correct '48 / 3 = 16 books', and step 5 therefore concludes with 'Fawn has 16.67 + 12 = 28.67 books' instead of the correct 'Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books'. Only the calculation of step 3 is wrong, subsequent steps have the correct procedure but use the erroneous value from step 3.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Let x = the number of books Anne has. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has x + 25 books. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has x + 12 books. The total number of books is x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85. Simplifying the equation, we get 3x + 37 = 85.",
        "corrected_answer": "33.00",
        "corrected_explanation": "To solve the equation 3x + 37 = 85, we subtract 37 from both sides to get 3x = 85 - 37, which is 3x = 48. Then we divide both sides by 3 to get x = 48 / 3, which is x = 16. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books. However, the original solution incorrectly handled the division, resulting in a non-integer number of books. The correct number of books for Fawn is 33."

Therefore, the correct calculation should be based on the number of leaves shed in the second week, which is 240 leaves, not the remaining total of 360 leaves."
