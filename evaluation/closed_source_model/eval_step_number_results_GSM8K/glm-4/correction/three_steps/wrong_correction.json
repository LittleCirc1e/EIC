        "question": "John is very unfit and decides to work up to doing a push-up. He trains 5 days a week for them and starts with wall push-ups. He adds 1 rep a day and once he gets to 15 reps he will start training high elevation push-ups. and then low elevation push-ups, and finally floor push-ups. How many weeks will it take him to get to floor push-ups?",
        "original_solution": "He needs to do 15*3=45 progressions\nThat will take 45/5=9 weeks\n#### 9",
        "original_answer": 9.0,
        "transformed_solution": "He needs to do 15*3=45 progressions\nThat will take 45/5=7 weeks\n#### 7",

        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This transformed solution has a calculation error in step 2 where 45/5 is incorrectly calculated as 7 instead of 9. This is the only calculation error present, and hence there is a single error. The correct calculation should have yielded that it will take 9 weeks, not 7 weeks. The original equation of 45/5 remains unaltered, but the arithmetic calculation provided is incorrect.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "He starts with wall push-ups and adds 1 rep per day. He needs to complete 15 reps of each type of push-up (wall, high elevation, low elevation, and floor) which is a total of 15 reps * 4 types = 60 progressions. Since he trains 5 days a week, it will take him 60 progressions / 5 days per week = 12 weeks.",
        "corrected_answer": 12.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The original solution incorrectly calculated the total number of progressions needed by multiplying the number of reps by 3 instead of 4, since there are 4 types of push-ups (wall, high elevation, low elevation, and floor). The correct calculation results in 60 progressions, which when divided by the 5 training days per week, equals 12 weeks."

        "question": "The stadium seats 60,000 fans, but only 75% of the seats were sold for the music show. Because of the threat of rain, 5,000 fans stayed home. How many attended the show?",
        "original_solution": "The number of seats sold was 0.75*60,000=45,000.\nAnd 45,000-5,000=40,000.\n#### 40,000",
        "original_answer": 40000.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The number of seats sold was 0.75*60,000=45,000.\nAnd 45,000-5,000=35,000.\n#### 35,000",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The example mistakenly calculates 45,000-5,000=35,000 instead of 45,000-5,000=40,000 in step 2. The error in the subtraction at step 2 affects only the final answer, not the initial calculation of seats sold (step 1). Note that the transformed solution only has one calculation error introduced, and subsequent steps correctly use the result from the erroneous step, following the pattern of inheriting the error.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "The number of seats sold was 0.75 * 60,000 = 45,000. However, due to the threat of rain, 5,000 fans who purchased tickets did not attend, so the actual attendance was 45,000 - 5,000 = 40,000.",
        "corrected_answer": 0.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The initial calculation correctly determined the number of seats sold, but the solution incorrectly subtracted the number of fans who stayed home from the total number of seats sold. The correct approach is to subtract the number of fans who did not attend from the number of seats sold."
