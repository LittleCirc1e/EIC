        "explanation": "The error is intentionally introduced in step 6 where the equation is incorrectly simplified to 2C+80-4C=80 instead of 2C+80-4C=70. This miscalculation leads to an incorrect result of -2C=0, and subsequently C=0, which doesn’t make sense in the context of the question as farmer Brown cannot have zero chickens.

        "corrected_explanation": "The mistake in the original solution was made during the simplification of the equation. The correct simplification is: 2C + 80 - 4C = 70, which leads to -2C = -10, and thus C = 5. Since we are looking for the number of chickens, the corrected answer is 5 chickens. However, the question asks for the number of animals that are chickens, and since we started with 20 animals, the number of cows would be 20 - 5 = 15. We must have made an error in calculation, because 5 chickens would only account for 10 legs. The correct number of chickens should be 10, not 5, to account for the extra 10 legs (2 legs per chicken), making the total number of legs from chickens 20 and from cows 50, which sums to the correct total of 70 legs."
