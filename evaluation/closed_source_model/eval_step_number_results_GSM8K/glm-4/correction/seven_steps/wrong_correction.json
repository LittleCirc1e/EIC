        "question": "Artie has a flower stand at the Farmers Market. He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias, and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot, and begonias for $2.12 per pot. Artie has no change today, so he has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he make?",

To hit his target of $1125, the total amount saved in the first half plus the second half must equal $1125. Therefore, the equation is: (15 * (y/2)) + (15 * y) = $1125. Simplifying the equation gives us: 15y/2 + 15y = $1125, which is equivalent to 30y/2 = $1125, or simply 15y = $1125. Solving for y gives us y = $1125 / 15, which is y = $75.",
