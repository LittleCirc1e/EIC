        "corrected_solution": "First, the 144 acres of grass will be eaten according to the equation 5*2*T + 8*1*T = 144. Solving this equation for T, we find 18*T = 144, or T = 8 months of food are covered by the animals grazing on the rancher's pasture. This means the farmer must buy feed corn for the remaining 12 - 8 = 4 months. The rancher's 8 sheep will require 4/2 = 2 bags of feed corn each, or 8*2 = 16 bags of feed corn in total for the 4 month period. The rancher's 5 cows will require 4 bags of feed corn each, or 5*4 = 20 bags of feed corn in total for the 4 month period. Therefore, the rancher needs 16+20 = 36 bags of feed corn for all of his animals. So, the rancher will need to spend 36*10 = $360 per year on feed corn.",

The corrected solution ensures that each cow requires 4 bags over the 4 month period, and the total cost is accurately calculated based on the correct number of bags required for both the sheep and the cows."

        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates 5H = 35 as 5H = 40 in step 5, which affects the subsequent steps. Step 6 inherits the error from step 5, modifying Hiro walked 7 km to Hiro walked 8 km. Step 7 inherits the error from step 6, modifying Rajesh walked 4(7) - 10 = 18 km to Rajesh walked 4(8) - 10 = 22 km. The previous steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 remain unchanged as they are not affected by the error introduced in step 5. The calculation error is only introduced in one step, and the subsequent related steps inherit this error without affecting the previous or unrelated steps.",

        "corrected_solution": "Let H = distance Hiro walked\n4H - 10 = distance Rajesh walked\nH + (4H - 10) = 25\n5H - 10 = 25\n5H = 35\nHiro walked 7 km so Rajesh walked 4(7) - 10 = 18 km",
        "corrected_answer": "18.0",
        "corrected_explanation": "The mistake in the original solution is in the arithmetic where it states 5H = 40. The correct calculation should be 5H = 35 because 25 + 10 = 35, not 40. Therefore, Hiro walked 7 km (35/5), and Rajesh walked 4 times that minus 10, which is 18 km."

        "corrected_explanation": "The calculation for the price of the final three chairs is incorrect. The extra 1/3 off is applied to the discounted price of $15, not the original price of $20. Therefore, the discount is $5, making the final price of each of the three chairs $15 - $5 = $10. The total cost of all chairs is then $75 for the first five and $30 for the last three, which sums up to $105."
