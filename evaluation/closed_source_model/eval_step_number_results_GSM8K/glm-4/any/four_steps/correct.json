        "explanation": "The error is introduced in step 3 where the subtraction 59.5 - 10.5 is incorrectly calculated as 48 instead of 49. This is the only step with an error, and it directly affects the final answer, which is now incorrectly stated as 48 feet instead of the correct 49 feet. The previous steps are correct and remain unchanged, and the error does not affect any unrelated steps.",
