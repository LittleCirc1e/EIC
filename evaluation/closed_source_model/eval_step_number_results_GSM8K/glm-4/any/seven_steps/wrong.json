        "question": "Hasan is packing up his apartment because he’s moving across the country for a new job. He needs to ship several boxes to his new home. The movers have asked that Hasan avoid putting more than a certain weight in pounds in any cardboard box. The moving company has helpfully provided Hasan with a digital scale that will alert him if a package is too heavy. Hasan is in the kitchen, and he fills a cardboard box with 38 dinner plates. When he checks the box, the scale reports his box is too heavy. Hasan knows each of his plates weighs 10 ounces. He removes a single plate from the box and checks the movers’ scale again. The scale reports his box is still too heavy. Hasan repeats the process again and again. When he has removed enough plates, the movers’ scale shows the box is now an acceptable weight for shipping.

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The error was introduced in step 5, where the calculation of the total number of parsnips in the half-full boxes was changed from 5 boxes * 10 parsnips = 50 parsnips to 5 boxes * 10 parsnips = 60 parsnips. This is a calculation error, as the operands and operators in the formula were not changed, but the result was altered. The subsequent step 7, which sums up the parsnips from the half-full and full boxes, inherits this error, leading to a final count of 360 parsnips instead of the correct 350. The previous steps and unrelated calculations remain unaffected by this error.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates that there are 15 full boxes and 5 half-full boxes. It then correctly multiplies the number of parsnips per full box (20) by the number of full boxes (15) and the number of parsnips per half-full box (10) by the number of half-full boxes (5), and adds these two totals together to get the correct number of parsnips Betty grows in an average harvest (360)."
