        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates 30*.3 as $10 instead of $9 in step 1, which affects the subsequent step 2 related to it. Step 2 inherits the error from step 1, modifying the formula 30+9=$39 to 30+10=$40. It should be noted that only one calculation error is introduced, and the subsequent related step will only inherit its error, which means the relevant numbers in the formula or language description inherit the error, but the calculation of the formula itself is still correct.",
