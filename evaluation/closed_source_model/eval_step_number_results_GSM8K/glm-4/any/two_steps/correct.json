        "explanation": "The transformed_solution contains a calculation error in step 1, where the division $105 / $3 is incorrectly calculated as 45 instead of 35. This error affects the subsequent step 2, where the sum is changed from 18 + 35 to 18 + 45, resulting in a transformed_answer of 63 instead of the correct 53. The previous steps and unrelated parts of the solution are not affected by this error.",

        "any_explanation": "The calculation in the solution assumes that the profit is the total revenue, which is not necessarily true. The profit should be calculated after subtracting the cost price of the watermelons from the total amount earned."
