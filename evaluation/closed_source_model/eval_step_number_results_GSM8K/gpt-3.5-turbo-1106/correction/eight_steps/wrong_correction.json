        "explanation": "The error is intentionally introduced in step 6 where the equation is incorrectly simplified to 2C+80-4C=80 instead of 2C+80-4C=70. This miscalculation leads to an incorrect result of -2C=0, and subsequently C=0, which doesnâ€™t make sense in the context of the question as farmer Brown cannot have zero chickens. The previous steps remain unchanged because they are not dependent on the outcome of the incorrect calculation step.",
