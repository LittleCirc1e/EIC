        "explanation": "The error was introduced during step 5, where the correct subtraction 131 - 10 to get 121 is instead wrongly recorded as 111. Since this is the calculation step where Arielleâ€™s age is determined, it is imperative to ensure that the other step after a miscalculation correctly inherits the error and uses the incorrect figure; as such, step 6 changes from 11x=121 to 11x=111 and finally step 7 results in x=111/11 or 10 instead of 121/11 or 11.",
