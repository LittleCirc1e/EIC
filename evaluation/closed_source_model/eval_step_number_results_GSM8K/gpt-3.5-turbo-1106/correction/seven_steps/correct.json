Step 5 inherits this error and adjusts the expected total points from 6x+25=265 to 6x+25=255, and finally, step 6 calculates the value of x based on this incorrect total, changing from 6x=240 to 6x=230 and wrongly getting x=38.33 points instead of the correct x=40 points.

        "question": "A rancher owns a mixture of 8 sheep and 5 cattle that graze on his land. In a typical year, the rancher will allow his animals to feed off his pastures for as long as possible before they run out of grass. After the pastures run out of grass, he must buy feed corn for $10 per bag. Each cow eats 2 acres of grass per month, and each sheep eats 1 acre of grass per month. Additionally, a bag of feed corn can feed each cow for 1 month and each sheep for 2 months. If the rancher's pasture contains 144 acres of grass, how much will the rancher need to spend on feed corn to feed his animals each year?",
        "original_solution": "First, the 144 acres of grass will be eaten according to the equation 5*2*T + 8*1*T = 144.\nSolving this equation for T, we find 18*T = 144, or T = 8 months of food are covered by the animals grazing on the rancher's pasture.\nThis means the farmer must buy feed corn for the remaining 12 - 8 = 4 months.\nNext, the rancher's 8 sheep will require 4/2 = 2 bags of feed corn each, or 8*2 = 16 bags of feed corn in total for the 4 month period.\nThe rancher's 5 cows will require 4/1 = 4 bags of feed corn each, or 5*4 = 20 bags of feed corn in total for the month.\nTherefore, the rancher needs 16+20 = 36 bags of feed corn for all of his animals.\nSo, the rancher will need to spend 36*10 = $360 per year on feed corn.\n#### 360",

This means the farmer must buy feed corn for the remaining 12 - 8 = 4 months. Next, the rancher's 8 sheep will require 4/2 = 2 bags of feed corn each, or 8*2 = 16 bags of feed corn in total for the 4 month period. The rancher's 5 cows will require 4/1 = 4 bags of feed corn each, or 5*4 = 20 bags of feed corn in total for the 4 month period.
