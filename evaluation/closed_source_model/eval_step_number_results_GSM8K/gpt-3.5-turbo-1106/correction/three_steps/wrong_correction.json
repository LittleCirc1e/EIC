        "original_solution": "Today the Dow was down 8722 / 98*2 = 178.\nSo it started at 8722 + 178 = 8900.\n#### 8900",
        "original_answer": 8900.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Today the Dow was down 8722 / 98*2 = 188.\nSo it started at 8722 + 188 = 8910.\n#### 8910",

        "explanation": "The transformed_solution shows an intentional wrong calculation of the first step: '8722 / 98*2 = 188' instead of the correct '8722 / 98*2 = 178'. The mistake in the first step carries over to the second step '8722 + 188 = 8910' to maintain the inherited error. The subsequent step is affected by using the erroneous result of 188; however, this step is still calculated correctly based on the new wrong input. The original step is '8722 + 178 = 8900', and the transformed solution alters the outcome to '8722 + 188 = 8910'. The transformed answer is therefore 8910, which is different from the original answer of 8900. This simulates a single miscalculation without changing any operands or operators in the formula.",

        "corrected_answer": "9110.20",
        "corrected_explanation": "The correct process is to first calculate the original value by dividing the final value by 0.98, then divide the result by 0.98 again to get the correct answer."
