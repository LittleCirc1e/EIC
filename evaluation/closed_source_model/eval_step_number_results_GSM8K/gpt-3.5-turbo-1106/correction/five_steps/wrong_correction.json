        "question": "In the post-apocalyptic wasteland, 1 lizard is worth 8 bottle caps, 3 lizards are worth 5 gallons of water, and 1 horse is worth 80 gallons of water. Marla can scavenge for 20 bottle caps each day, but needs to pay 4 bottle caps per night for food and shelter. How many days does it take Marla to collect all the bottlecaps she needs to buy a horse?",
        "original_solution": "First find how many lizards you get for one gallon of water: 3 lizards / 5 gallons = .6 lizards/gallon\nThen figure out how many lizards 80 gallons of water is worth: 80 gallons * .6 lizards/gallon = 48 lizards\nThen figure out how many bottle caps 48 lizards is worth: 48 lizards * 8 bottle caps/lizard = 384 bottle caps\nThen figure out how many bottle caps Marla can save each day by subtracting the number she spends from the number she finds: 20 bottlecaps/day - 4 bottlecaps/day = 16 bottlecaps/day\nFinally, divide the number of bottle caps Marla needs by the number she saves each day: 384 bottle caps / 16 bottle caps/day = 24 days\n#### 24",

        "explanation": "In this example, the calculation of how many bottle caps Marla can save each day is altered incorrectly from 16 bottlecaps/day to 15 bottlecaps/day in step 4. This error affects the final step, which is the calculation of the number of days Marla needs to collect the bottle caps. The original division of 384 bottle caps / 16 bottle caps/day = 24 days is changed to 384 bottle caps / 15 bottle caps/day = 25.6 days. The previous steps remain unaffected by this error, and the calculation error is only present in step 4, with the subsequent step 5 inheriting this error.",

        "corrected_solution": "First find how many bottle caps Marla needs to buy a horse: 80 gallons * 8 bottle caps/gallon = 640 bottle caps. Then figure out how many bottle caps Marla can save each day by subtracting the number she spends from the number she finds: 20 bottlecaps/day - 4 bottlecaps/day = 16 bottlecaps/day. Finally, divide the number of bottle caps Marla needs by the number she saves each day: 640 bottle caps / 16 bottle caps/day = 40 days.",
