        "question": "Bethany loved riding horses.  She rode 1 hour after school every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  On Tuesday and Thursday, she rode for 30 min and on Saturdays, she could ride for 2 hours.  How many hours in total did she ride over a 2 week period?",
        "original_solution": "She rode 1 hour every Monday, Wednesday and Friday each week so every week she rode 1*3 = 3 hours\nShe rode 30 min on Tuesday and Thursday each week for a total of 30*2 = 60 min or 1 hour\nOn Mon, Wed & Friday she rode 3 hours, 1 hour total on Tue and Thur and 2 hours on Sat for a total of 3+1+2 = 6 hours\nShe rode 6 hours per week for 2 weeks so in total she rode 6*2 = 12 hours\n#### 12",
        "original_answer": 12.0,

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This transformation changes the result of the last calculation from 6*2 = 12 to 6*2 = 11, which is a clear calculation error. The steps prior to this are unaffected, as the operands or operators of those steps have not been changed. Consequently, only step 4 in the original solution is altered to reflect this single calculation error, resulting in an answer of 11 hours instead of the correct 12 hours. The rest of the transformed solution must be accurately derived from the incorrect product of this wrong step.",

        "corrected_answer": 12,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution is incorrect because the total hours she rode over a 2 week period should be 12, not 11. The correct calculation should be 6 hours per week for 2 weeks, which equals 12 hours in total."

        "question": "A pet store owner had 12 birds, 9 puppies, 5 cats, and 15 spiders. Half the birds were sold and 3 puppies were adopted. Then, someone left the spider enclosure open and 7 of them went loose. How many animals does the pet store owner have left?",

This error is propagated to step 4, affecting the total count calculation without changing the structure of the step (no operand or operator is changed); the new incorrect total is calculated as 5 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 23 instead of 5 + 6 + 6 + 8 = 25.
