        "original_solution": "The lake is 20 miles across because 2 x 10 = 20\nIf takes .5 hours to go from bottom to top because 30 / 60 = .5\nThe lake is five miles from bottom to top because 10 x .5 = 5\nThe square mileage is 100 because 20 x 5 = 100\n#### 100",

        "corrected_solution": "The lake is 20 miles across because 2 x 10 = 20\nIt takes 2 hours to go across the width of the lake, so the width is 10 miles because 10 x 2 = 20\nThe square mileage is 200 because 20 x 10 = 200",

        "corrected_explanation": "The original solution incorrectly calculated the width of the lake and the square mileage. The correct process is to calculate the width of the lake and then multiply the length by the width to find the square mileage."
