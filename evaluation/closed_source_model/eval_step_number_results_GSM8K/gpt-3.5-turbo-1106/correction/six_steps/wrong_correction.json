        "question": "At a CD store, 40% of the CDs cost $10 each, and the rest cost $5 each. Prince bought half the CDs sold at $10 each, and all of the CDs sold at $5 each. If the total number of CDs was 200, how much money did Prince spend on buying the CDs?",
        "original_solution": "The number of CDs selling at $10 each at the store is 40/100*200 = 80\nThis means the store sells 200-80 = 120 CDs at $5 each.\nPrince bought 1/2*80 = 40 of the CDs selling at $10 each.\nThe total amount of money Prince paid for the 40 CDs selling at $10 each is $40*10 = $400\nIf he bought all the CDs selling at $5 each, he paid a total of $5*120 = $600\nFor all the CDs he bought, Prince spent $600+$400= $1000\n#### 1000",

        "explanation": "In this example, the calculation error occurs in step 5, where the total amount Prince paid for the CDs selling at $5 each is incorrectly calculated as $5*120 = $580 instead of $5*120 = $600. This error affects the final step (step 6), where the total amount Prince spent is calculated as $580+$400 = $980 instead of $600+$400 = $1000. The previous steps remain unchanged because they are not affected by the error in step 5.",

        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates 8*3=23 pockets instead of 8*3=24 pockets in step 5, which affects the final step 6. The previous steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 remain unchanged because they are not related to the error introduced in step 5. Step 6 inherits the error from step 5, modifying the calculation from 8+24=32 pockets to 8+23=31 pockets. It should be noted that only one calculation error is introduced, and the subsequent related step will inherit this error, which means the relevant numbers in the formula or language description inherit the error, but the calculation of the formula itself is still correct.",
