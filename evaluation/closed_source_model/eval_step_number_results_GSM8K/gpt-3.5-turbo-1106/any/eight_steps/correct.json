        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The error was introduced in the final step of the calculation, where the total number of drawings for the first five pages was incorrectly calculated as 25+50 = 70 instead of the correct 25+50 = 75. This error does not affect the previous steps, as it is only a miscalculation in the final addition.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "any_explanation": "The solution is incorrect because the calculation for the total number of drawings on the first five pages is incorrect. The correct total number of drawings on the first five pages should be 5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 25 = 75, not 70."
