        "question": "A rancher owns a mixture of 8 sheep and 5 cattle that graze on his land. In a typical year, the rancher will allow his animals to feed off his pastures for as long as possible before they run out of grass. After the pastures run out of grass, he must buy feed corn for $10 per bag. Each cow eats 2 acres of grass per month, and each sheep eats 1 acre of grass per month. Additionally, a bag of feed corn can feed each cow for 1 month and each sheep for 2 months. If the rancher's pasture contains 144 acres of grass, how much will the rancher need to spend on feed corn to feed his animals each year?",
        "original_solution": "First, the 144 acres of grass will be eaten according to the equation 5*2*T + 8*1*T = 144.\nSolving this equation for T, we find 18*T = 144, or T = 8 months of food are covered by the animals grazing on the rancher's pasture.\nThis means the farmer must buy feed corn for the remaining 12 - 8 = 4 months.\nNext, the rancher's 8 sheep will require 4/2 = 2 bags of feed corn each, or 8*2 = 16 bags of feed corn in total for the 4 month period.\nThe rancher's 5 cows will require 4/1 = 4 bags of feed corn each, or 5*4 = 20 bags of feed corn in total for the month.\nTherefore, the rancher needs 16+20 = 36 bags of feed corn for all of his animals.\nSo, the rancher will need to spend 36*10 = $360 per year on feed corn.\n#### 360",

        "original_solution": "Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared.\nThe square of the base of the first triangle is 4*4=16 square inches\nThe square of the height of the first triangle is 3*3=9 square inches.\nThe sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16+9=25\nThe square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is √25=5 inches.\nSince the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3+4=7 inches\nIf you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7+5=12 inches.\n#### 12",
