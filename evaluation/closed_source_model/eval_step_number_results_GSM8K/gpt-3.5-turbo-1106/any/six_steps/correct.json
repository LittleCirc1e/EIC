        "question": "Janet has 24 dresses.  Half of them have pockets.  Of those, a third have 2 pockets and the rest have 3 pockets.  How many total pockets do her dresses have?",
        "original_solution": "She has 24/2=12 dresses with pockets\nOf those 12/3=4 have 2 pockets\nSo 12-4=8 have three pockets\nSo the dresses with 2 pockets have 2*4=8 pockets\nThe other dresses contribute 8*3=24 pockets\nSo she has a total of 8+24=32 pockets\n#### 32",
        "original_answer": 32.0,
        "transformed_solution": "She has 24/2=12 dresses with pockets\nOf those 12/3=4 have 2 pockets\nSo 12-4=8 have three pockets\nSo the dresses with 2 pockets have 2*4=8 pockets\nThe other dresses contribute 8*3=23 pockets\nSo she has a total of 8+23=31 pockets\n#### 31",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates 8*3=23 pockets instead of 8*3=24 pockets in step 5, which affects the final step 6. The previous steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 remain unchanged because they are not related to the error introduced in step 5. Step 6 inherits the error from step 5, modifying the calculation from 8+24=32 pockets to 8+23=31 pockets. It should be noted that only one calculation error is introduced, and the subsequent related step will inherit this error, which means the relevant numbers in the formula or language description inherit the error, but the calculation of the formula itself is still correct.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "any_explanation": "The solution is incorrect because the calculation for the number of pockets in dresses with 3 pockets is incorrect. It should be 8*3=24, not 8*3=23. Therefore, the total number of pockets should be 8+24=32, not 31."
