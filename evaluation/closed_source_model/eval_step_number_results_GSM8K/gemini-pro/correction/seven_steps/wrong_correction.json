        "question": "Rodney is a door-to-door salesman trying to sell home security systems. He gets a commission of $25 for each system he sells. He is canvassing a neighborhood of four streets with eight houses each. The first street gave him half the sales that the second street did, while every house on the third street turned him away and the fourth street resulted in only one sale. His total commission was $175. How many security systems did he sell on the second street?",
        "original_solution": "Let S be the number of systems Rodney sold on the first street.\nHe sold 2S systems on the second street.\nBased on his commission, he sold 175 / 25 = 7 systems.\nIn all, he sold S + 2S + 0 + 1 = 3S + 1 = 7 systems.\nOn the first and second streets, he sold 3S = 7 - 1 = 6 systems.\nThus, on the first street he sold S = 6 / 3 = 2 systems.\nOn the second street, Rodney sold 2 * 2 = 4 security systems.\n#### 4",

        "transformed_solution": "Let S be the number of systems Rodney sold on the first street.\nHe sold 2S systems on the second street.\nBased on his commission, he sold 175 / 25 = 7 systems.\nIn all, he sold S + 2S + 0 + 1 = 3S + 1 = 5 systems.\nOn the first and second streets, he sold 3S = 5 - 1 = 4 systems.\nThus, on the first street he sold S = 4 / 3 =1.33 systems.\nOn the second street, Rodney sold 2 * 1.33 = 2.66 security systems.\n#### 2.66",

        "wrong_step": 4,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The mistake originates from the calculation in step 4 where in the transformed solution 3S + 1 was wrongly calculated as 5 instead of 7. This change affects steps 5, 6, and 7, which all depend on the result from step 4. Therefore, step 5 becomes 3S = 5 - 1 = 4 systems, step 6 becomes S = 4 / 3 = 1.33 systems, and step 7 becomes 2 * 1.33 = 2.66 security systems sold on the second street.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Let the number of systems Rodney sold on the first street be x. \nSince the first street gave him half the sales that the second street did, he must have sold 2x systems on the second street. \nGiven that he gets a commission of $25 for each system he sells, we know he sold 175 / 25 = 7 systems in total. \nIt is given that he sold no systems on the third street, and 1 system on the fourth street. \nSo, we can set up an equation: x + 2x + 0 + 1 = 7. \nSolving for x, we get x = 3. \nThus, Rodney sold 2 * 3 = 6 systems on the second street.",
        "corrected_answer": 6,
        "corrected_explanation": "The original solution mistakenly assumes that Rodney sold 1.33 systems on the first street, which leads to an incorrect final answer. The corrected process involves setting up an equation based on the given information and solving for the number of systems sold on the first street, which is then used to determine the number of systems sold on the second street."
