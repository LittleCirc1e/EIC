        "question": "The teacher decided to rewards his students with extra recess on report card day if they got good grades. Students normally get 20 minutes for recess. He told the students that every A got them 2 extra minutes of recess. Every B got them one extra minute. Every C got them zero extra minutes, but every D got them 1 less minute. When report cards came out there were 10 As, 12 Bs, 14Cs, and 5Ds. In total, how much recess would the students get that day?",
        "original_solution": "The students have 20 minutes to start.\nThey get 20 minutes added for the As because 10 times 2 equals 20\nThey get 12 minutes added for the Bs because 12 times 1 equals 12\nThey get no minutes added or subtracted for the Cs because 14 times 0 equals 0.\nThey get 5 minutes taken away for the Ds because 5 times 1 equals 5.\nIn total, they get 47 minutes of recess because 20 plus 20 plus 12 minus 5 equals 47.\n#### 47",
        "original_answer": 47.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The students have 20 minutes to start.\nThey get 20 minutes added for the As because 10 times 2 equals 20\nThey get 12 minutes added for the Bs because 12 times 1 equals 12\nThey get no minutes added or subtracted for the Cs because 14 times 0 equals 0.\nThey get 7 minutes taken away for the Ds because 5 times 1 equals 7.\nIn total, they get 45 minutes of recess because 20 plus 20 plus 12 minus 7 equals 45.\n#### 45",
        "transformed_answer": 45.0,
        "wrong_step": 4,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, the error occurs in step 4, where the minutes taken away for the Ds are mistakenly calculated as 7 instead of 5. This error influences the total time calculated in the final step, changing the correct total from 47 minutes to an incorrect total of 45 minutes. The steps related to computing the time for As, Bs, and Cs remain unaltered, as they do not depend on step 4.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Students start off with 20 minutes of recess.\nThey get 20 minutes added for the As because 10 times 2 equals 20.\nThey get 12 minutes added for the Bs because 12 times 1 equals 12.\nThey get 0 minutes added for the Cs because 14 times 0 equals 0.\nThey get 5 minutes taken away for the Ds because 5 times 1 equals 5.\nIn total, they get 37 minutes of recess because 20 plus 20 plus 12 plus 0 minus 5 equals 37.",
        "corrected_answer": 37,
        "corrected_explanation": "The mistake in the original solution is that it subtracts 7 minutes for the Ds, when it should only subtract 5 minutes."
