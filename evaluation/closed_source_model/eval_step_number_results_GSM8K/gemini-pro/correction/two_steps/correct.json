        "question": "Carly had 42 lollipops to share with her friends. Half of the lollipops were cherry, and the rest were equal amounts of watermelon, sour apple, and grape. How many lollipops were grape?",
        "original_solution": "Of her 42 lollipops, half were cherry, so 42 lollipops / 2 = 21 were not cherry.\nOf the 21 that were not cherry, 1/3 of them were grape, so 21 lollipops / 3 = 7 grape lollipops.\n#### 7",

        "transformed_solution": "Of her 42 lollipops, half were cherry, so 42 lollipops / 2 = 22 were not cherry.\nOf the 22 that were not cherry, 1/3 of them were grape, so 22 lollipops / 3 = 7.33 grape lollipops.\n#### 7.33",

        "explanation": "In this example, the 42 lollipops / 2 calculation in step 1 is mistakenly given as 22 instead of 21. This error affects the second step since it relies on the outcome of the first step. Therefore, the second step takes the incorrect value of 22 and proceeds with the division by 3 to find the number of grape lollipops. However, the division is still correctly calculated using the erroneous value. No other parts of the original solution, including operators or operands, are changed.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Since there are three other flavors besides cherries, each flavor should comprise one third of the number of lollipops that are not cherry. Therefore, to find the number of grape lollipops, you should divide the number of non-cherry lollipops by 3.\nNumber of lollipops that are not cherry = (42 lollipops / 2) = 21 lollipops\nNumber of grape lollipops = (21 lollipops / 3) = 7 lollipops",
        "corrected_answer": 7,
        "corrected_explanation": "The corrected solution solves the problem by dividing the number of lollipops that are not cherry by the number of flavors (including grape) that are not cherry."

        "question": "Wendy just started working at an Italian restaurant. She polished 50 small glasses and 10 more large glasses than small glasses. How many glasses did she polish?",
        "original_solution": "She polished 50 + 10 = 60 large glasses.\nTherefore, Wendy polished 50 + 60 = 110 glasses.\n#### 110",
        "original_answer": 110.0,

        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, the calculation in the first step is changed incorrectly from 50 + 10 = 60 to 50 + 10 = 70. This is a calculation error where the sum of 50 and 10 is wrongly taken as 70 instead of the correct 60. The subsequent step inherits this error, changing the sum from 50 + 60 = 110 to 50 + 70 = 120, thus affecting the result of the total calculation. This single error impacted the final result without changing any operands or operators from the original solution. The calculation within the subsequent step is correct, but it incorrectly uses the erroneous result from the previous step.",
