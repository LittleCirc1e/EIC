The other software package costs $60 and covers up to 10 devices.  How much money, in dollars, can the school save by buying the $60 software package instead of the $40 software package?",
        "original_solution": "There are 50/5 = 10 sets of 5 devices in the school.\nSo the school will pay a total of $40 x 10 = $400 for the $40 software package.\nThere are 50/10 = 5 sets of 10 devices in the school.\nSo the school will pay a total of $60 x 5 = $300 for the $60 software package.\nThus, the school can save $400 - $300 = $100 from buying the $60 software instead of the $40 software package.\n#### 100",

        "explanation": "The wrong step occurred in the last step, where the calculation of savings was erroneously stated as $400 - $100 = $300 instead of the correct $400 - $300 = $100 from the original solution. Since the wrong step is at the end of the solution, no subsequent steps are present to inherit the error. The calculation within the step is a deliberate mistake in order to construct a transformed solution with a different answer from the original one.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "First, the cost for the school buying the $40 software package and the cost for buying the $60 software package should be calculated individually. As the $40 software package covers up to 5 devices and the school has 50 devices, 10 sets of $40 software packages are needed. So the cost for the school buying the $40 software package for 50 devices is 10 * 40 = $400.Similarly, as the $60 software package covers up to 10 devices and the school has 50 devices, 5 sets of $60 software packages are needed. So the cost for the school buying the $60 software package for 50 devices is 5 * 60 = $300. Then the money the school can save by buying the $60 software package instead of the $40 software package is $400 - $300 = $100.",

The subsequent steps 4 and 5, which are related to the correct value of time spent doing push-ups, are also affected. Step 5 changes the original calculation of 44 / 2 = 22 push-ups to the mistaken result of 40 / 2 = 20 push-ups.

She takes two 8-second breaks,\nso her actual push-up time is (60 - 2 * 8) = 44 seconds.\n3. We can multiply her push-up rate by the time spent actually doing push-ups to know how many push-ups she can do in one minute.\nThat is, 0.5 push-ups/second * 44 seconds = 22 push-ups in one minute.\n#### 22",
