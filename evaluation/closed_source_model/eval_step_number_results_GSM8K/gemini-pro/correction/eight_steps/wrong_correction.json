        "original_solution": "Let C be the number of chickens.\nThere are 20-C cows.\nThe cows have 4*(20-C) legs.\nThe cows have 2C legs.\nThe total number of legs is 2C+4(20-C)=70.\n2C+80-4C=70\n2C=10\nC=5\n#### 5",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The error is intentionally introduced in step 6 where the equation is incorrectly simplified to 2C+80-4C=80 instead of 2C+80-4C=70. This miscalculation leads to an incorrect result of -2C=0, and subsequently C=0, which doesnâ€™t make sense in the context of the question as farmer Brown cannot have zero chickens. The previous steps remain unchanged because they are not dependent on the outcome of the incorrect calculation step.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Let C be the number of chickens, and C is in [0,20].\nLet B be the number of cows, so B is in [0,20].\nWe know that C+B=20.\nThe cows have 4*(20-C) legs.\nThe cows have 2C legs.\nThe total number of legs is 2C+4(20-C)=70.\n2C+80-4C=80\n-2C=-80\nC=40\nTherefore we have C=40/2=20, which is impossible since C is in [0,20].\nThe problem itself is wrong.",
        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The given solution made a mistake when solving the equation for C. The corrected solution shows that the problem itself is wrong and has no solution."

Consequently, the length of the red rope in the final step is also affected, changing from 20 cm to 18.67 cm. The previous steps remain unchanged as they are not affected by the error introduced in step 6. The calculation error is only in one step, and the subsequent related steps inherit this error without affecting the previous or unrelated steps.",

The error is introduced in the final calculation step, which does not affect the previous steps. The steps leading up to the final calculation are correct, but the final step incorrectly states Rodney's lifting capacity, resulting in a transformed answer of 160 pounds instead of the correct 146 pounds.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The corrected solution should set up the three person's lifting weights as three individual equations, then add the equations to get a total amount. After that, we can find the value of x by solving the equation."
