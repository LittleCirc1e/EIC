        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this example, step 6 mistakenly calculates 32 / 4 as 7 instead of the correct result of 8. Steps 7 and 8 use the result of step 6, so they are altered accordingly. Step 6 should be corrected to N = 32 / 4 = 8 dogs with 4 legs. Step 7 will change to correctly adding the three 3-legged dogs to the count, resulting in the total being 8 + 3 = 11 dogs. All previous steps are unaffected and remain the same as the original solution.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Let N be the number of dogs with 4 legs Carly worked on, and M be the number of dogs with three legs. Then we know that N + M represents the total number of dogs. At 4 nails per paw, she trimmed 164 / 4 = 41 paws. Since dogs with 4 legs have 4 paws each, and dogs with 3 legs have 3 paws each, we can set up the equation: 4N + 3M = 41. Also, we know that Carly worked on 3 of dogs with 3 legs. So we can write M = 3. Then we can use these two equations to solve for N and M. Plugging M = 3 into 4N + 3M = 41, we get 4N + 3(3) = 41, which simplifies to 4N + 9 = 41. Subtracting 9 from both sides, we obtain 4N = 32, and dividing both sides by 4, we find N = 8. This means there are 8 dogs with 4 legs. Adding 8 and 3, we find the total number of dogs Carly worked on is 11.",
        "corrected_answer": "11",
        "corrected_explanation": "The corrected solution first defines N and M as the number of dogs with 4 legs and 3 legs, respectively, and then sets up an equation based on the information that 4N + 3M = 41. Since we know that there are 3 dogs with 3 legs, we substitute M with 3 and solve the equation to find N = 8, which represents the number of dogs with 4 legs. Finally, adding N and M, we find that Carly worked on 11 dogs in total."
