Zoey's has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet. What is the average total distance spat?",
        "original_solution": "Zoey spits a total distance of 400 feet because 40 x 10 = 400\nSydney spits a total distance of 420 feet because 35 x 12 = 420\nThis totals to 820 feet because 400 + 420 = 820\nThe average total distance is 410 because 820 / 2 = 410\n#### 410",

        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates the total distance as 800 feet instead of 820 feet in step 3, which affects the subsequent step 4 related to it. Step 4 inherits the error from step 3, modifying the calculation from 820 / 2 = 410 to 800 / 2 = 400. It should be noted that only one calculation error is introduced, and the subsequent related steps to this wrong step will only inherit its error, which means the relevant numbers in the formula or language description inherit the error, but the calculation of the formula itself is still correct.",

        "corrected_answer": 14,
        "corrected_explanation": "The problem states that Micah has 52 ¥ to spend, and that he needs to buy 6 envelopes that weigh less than 5 pounds, and each of these envelopes costs 2 ¥. So, the total cost for the envelopes that weigh less than 5 pounds is 6 * 2 = 12 ¥. Micah has 52 - 12 = 40 ¥ left to spend on the envelopes that weigh more than 5 pounds. Since each of these envelopes costs 5 ¥, Micah can buy 40 / 5 = 8 of them. Therefore, Micah needed to buy 6 + 8 = 14 envelopes in total."
