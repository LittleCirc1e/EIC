This error propagates through the rest of the solution without altering the original formula structure. The subsequent steps inherit the erroneous result of step 3, where step 4 calculates x as '50 / 3 = 16.67 books' instead of the correct '48 / 3 = 16 books', and step 5 therefore concludes with 'Fawn has 16.67 + 12 = 28.67 books' instead of the correct 'Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books'.
