        "original_solution": "For every addition of 100 people added the speed is halved so for the first 100 people added its speed is 1/2 * 500 km/hr = 250 km/hr.\nFor another addition of 100 people its speed is also halved, 1/2 * 250 km/hr = 125 km/hr.

This results in a transformed answer of 100 km/hr, which is different from the original answer of 125 km/hr.

        "is_correct": "no",

The subsequent step inherits this error, changing the sum from 50 + 60 = 110 to 50 + 70 = 120, thus affecting the result of the total calculation. This single error impacted the final result without changing any operands or operators from the original solution. The calculation within the subsequent step is correct, but it incorrectly uses the erroneous result from the previous step.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "any_explanation": "The solution is incorrect. The step 'She polished 50 + 10 = 70 large glasses.' is incorrect because it incorrectly adds 10 to 50 to get the number of large glasses, when in fact the number of large glasses polished is 10 more than the number of small glasses. To find the total number of glasses polished, one needs to add the number of small glasses to the number of large glasses."
