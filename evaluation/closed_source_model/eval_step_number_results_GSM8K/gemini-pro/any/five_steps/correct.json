        "question": "On the planet Popton, there are two races of beings: the Hoopits and Neglarts. Each Hoopit has 3 toes on each of their 4 hands, while each Neglart only has 2 toes on each of their 5 hands. If a Popton automated driverless school bus always carries 7 Hoopit students and 8 Neglart students, how many toes are on the Popton school bus?",
        "original_solution": "Each Hoopit has 4 hands, each with 3 toes, for a total of 4*3=12 toes.\nEach Neglart has 5 hands, each with 2 toes, for a total of 5*2=10 toes.\nEach school bus has 7 Hoopit students, for a total of 7*12=84 Hoopit toes.\nEach school bus also carries 8 Neglart students, for a total of 8*10=80 Neglart toes.\nThus, the total number of toes on a bus carrying 7 Hoopit students and 8 Neglart students would be 84+80=164 toes.\n#### 164",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates 8*10 as 70 instead of 80 in step 4, which affects the final step of adding the Hoopit and Neglart toes together. The previous steps remain unchanged because they are not affected by the error in step 4. The final step is modified to reflect the incorrect total of Neglart toes, changing the sum from 84+80=164 toes to 84+70=154 toes.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "any_explanation": "The solution has a conceptual error. Although each Hoopit has 4 hands and each hand has 3 toes, the calculation of Hoopit toes should multiply the number of hands by the number of toes per hand and then multiply by the number of Hoopit students. Similarly, the calculation of Neglarts's toes should multiply the number of hands by the number of toes per hand and then multiply by the number of Neglarts's students. The correct way to calculate should be like this. 4 * 3 * 7 = 84 Hoopit toes. 5 * 2 * 8 = 80 Neglarts's toes. Therefore the total number of toes will be 84 + 80 = 164."

        "question": "Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?",
        "original_solution": "In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = 50 pieces of straw.\nBetween the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = 70 pieces of straw.\nAs the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.\nSo in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = 30 pieces of straw.\nThis means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = 5 rats.\n#### 5",
        "original_answer": 5.0,
        "transformed_solution": "In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = 50 pieces of straw.\nBetween the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = 70 pieces of straw.\nAs the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 80 pieces of straws.\nSo in each cage, there are 80 pieces of straw / 3 cages = 26.67 pieces of straw.\nThis means that each cage has 26.67 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = 4.44 rats.\n#### 4.44",

        "wrong_step": 3,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The error was introduced in step 3 by changing the subtraction result from 90 to 80 pieces of straw for the rats. This error then affects the subsequent steps. Step 4 is changed to reflect the new total of 80 pieces of straw divided by 3 cages, resulting in 26.67 pieces of straw per cage. Step 5 then calculates the number of rats per cage based on the incorrect number of pieces of straw per cage, resulting in 4.44 rats per cage instead of the correct 5 rats per cage. The calculation error in step 3 is the only error introduced, and the subsequent steps correctly use the erroneous result from step 3.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "any_explanation": "The solution has a conceptual mistake. The number of pieces of straw used on each rat should be rounded to the nearest integer before calculating the number of rats in each cage, as a rat cannot be split into a fraction. Therefore, each rat should have 5 pieces of straw instead of 4.44 pieces of straw."
