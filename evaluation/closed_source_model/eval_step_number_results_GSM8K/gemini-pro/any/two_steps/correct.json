        "original_solution": "For every addition of 100 people added the speed is halved so for the first 100 people added its speed is 1/2 * 500 km/hr = 250 km/hr.\nFor another addition of 100 people its speed is also halved, 1/2 * 250 km/hr = 125 km/hr.

Thus, the speed of the spaceship with 400 people on board cannot be 100 km per hour."
