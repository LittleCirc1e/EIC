        "explanation": "In this case, an error was introduced in step 7 by changing the result of the division from C = 18 to C = 20. This error directly impacts the last step where Ford's age is calculated, changing Ford's correct age from 16 (based on C = 18) to 18 (based on the incorrect C = 20). The previous steps are unaffected by this error and thus remain the same as the original solution. It should be noted that step 8 has been updated to reflect the incorrect result from step 7 (18 - 2 = 18 rather than 16), ensuring the transformed solution is self-consistent while the calculation error still stands.",
