        "original_solution": "First convert the speed from km/h to m/s: 36 km/h * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/h) = 10 m/s\nThe time it takes to pass the telegraph post is the length of the train divided by the speed: 30 m / 10 m/s = 3 s\n#### 3 seconds",

        "explanation": "In this example, the division step for calculating the time (step 2) is where the calculation error has been intentionally introduced. Instead of using the correct speed of 10 m/s, the calculation mistakenly uses 2 m/s. As a result, the time to pass the telegraph post is incorrectly calculated as 30 m / 2 m/s = 15 s instead of the correct 30 m / 10 m/s = 3 s. The previous step related to the speed conversion remains unaffected as it is not related to the miscalculation in the final answer. Here, the changed step 1 that leads to the miscalculation in step 2 is consistent in keeping the explanation relevant to the type of error, which is a calculation error, and only one error is considered for the transformation process.",

Step 3, as the subsequent step of step 2, references the erroneous result of step 2, resulting in the incorrect final answer."
