It should be noted that step 1 in the transformed_solution <The rate of the pipe is 2/3 / 12 = 1/18 of the cistern per minute.> should be the same as the step 1 in the original_solution <The rate of the pipe is 2/3 / 12 = 1/18 of the cistern per minute.> and calculates its result 1/18 correctly. The subsequent step 2 references this correct result but uses an incorrect value (1/16) instead.

The error is isolated to step 4 and does not affect the restatement of the problem in previous steps, nor the correct procedure in the last step, just the numerical value obtained.
