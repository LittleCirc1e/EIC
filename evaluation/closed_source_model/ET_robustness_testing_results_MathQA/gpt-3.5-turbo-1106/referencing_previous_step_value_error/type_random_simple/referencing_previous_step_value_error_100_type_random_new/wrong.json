It should be noted that step 2 in the transformed_solution <Vijay completes 1/24 of the work in one day because 1 / 24 = 0.041666666666666664> should be the same as the step 2 in the original_solution <Vijay completes 1/24 of the work in one day because 1 / 24 = 0.041666666666666664> and calculates its result 0.041666666666666664 correctly. Step 4, as the subsequent related step of step 3, is affected by step 3 and changes the calculation from using 0.16666666666666666 to using 0.166 to find the number of days and results in approximately 6.02 days (rounded to two decimal places).
