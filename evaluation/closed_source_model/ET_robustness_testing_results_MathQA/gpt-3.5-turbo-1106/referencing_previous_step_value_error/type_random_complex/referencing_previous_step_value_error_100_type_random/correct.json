        "question": "George is 8 years more than Christopher and Ford is 2 years younger than Christopher. The sum of their ages is 60. Find the ages of Ford.",
        "original_solution": "Let's denote Christopher's age as C. George's age is then C + 8.\nFord's age is C - 2.\nWe form the equation C + (C + 8) + (C - 2) = 60 to represent the sum of their ages.\nCombining like terms, we get 3C + 6 = 60.\nSubtracting 6 from both sides, we get 3C = 54.\nDividing by 3, we get C = 18.\nSo, Ford's age is 18 - 2 = 16.\n#### 16",

        "explanation": "Step 8 mistakenly references 2 as 4 from the previous step and changes 18 - 2 = 16 to 18 - 4 = 14.

All other steps that reference this result number still reference this number correctly. The subsequent steps related to step 8 will be affected by the erroneous result of this step but still be calculated correctly, based on the mistake carried forward. You need to only consider one step error, so the calculation of all steps is still correct except for the modified one.",
