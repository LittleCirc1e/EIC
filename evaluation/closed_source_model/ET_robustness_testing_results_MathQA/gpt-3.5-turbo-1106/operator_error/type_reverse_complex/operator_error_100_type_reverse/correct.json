        "explanation": "This example changes the subtraction in step 1 to addition, changing 43x - 34x = 1251 to 43x + 34x = 1251 by changing - to +. The subsequent step 2 changes from 9x = 1251 to 77x = 1251 due to the change in the operator from the previous step. Finally, step 3 simplifies the equation from 77x = 1251 to x = 1251 / 77 and calculates x to be 16.25. It should be noted that only the operator in step 1 is incorrect, but its calculation is correct, which leads to different results from the original solution. This affects the subsequent steps, but the calculation of all steps following the incorrect operator change is correct.",

The original solution added the individual percentages of length and breadth losses and the product of both percentages, which correctly reflects the combined effect on area (multiplicative). By changing the first plus sign to a minus sign, the calculation becomes 20% - 20% + (20% x 20%) = 44%, which is mathematically incorrect for calculating the percentage decrease in area but follows the instructions provided for the transformation process.
