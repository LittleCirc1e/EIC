        "original_solution": "The radio was the 17th highest price, so there were 16 items priced higher than the radio.\nThe radio was the 24th lowest price, so there were 23 items priced lower than the radio.\nThere were 16 + 1 + 23 = 40 items sold at the garage sale.\n#### 40",

This change leads to a recalculation of the items priced lower than the radio from 23 to 22 and ultimately affects the total number of items sold, changing from 40 items in the original_solution to 39 items in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in a single step, and the other calculation processes should be correct.",
