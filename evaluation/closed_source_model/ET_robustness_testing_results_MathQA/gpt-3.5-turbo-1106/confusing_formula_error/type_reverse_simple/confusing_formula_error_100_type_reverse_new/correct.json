Instead, the transformed solution mistakenly calculates the perimeter by adding the distances between opposite vertices and then wrongly uses this value squared divided by 2 as the area, which is not a valid formula for area. The step to calculate the distance between opposite vertices (20 units) remains correct, but the next step turns it erroneously into a perimeter calculation. The actual area (correct formula) is (20 * 20) / 2 = 200 square units, but after introducing the error, the area is wrongly calculated as (80 * 80) / 2 = 3200 square units.

The question requires solving for the area of the rug which is the area of the center rectangle after excluding the strips. The correct way to handle this, as done in the original_solution, is to subtract twice the width of the strips from both the length and width of the floor and then multiply these new dimensions. The error introduced changes the step from subtracting to adding the strip widths to the length and width, which incorrectly calculates a perimeter instead. This misunderstanding of area vs. perimeter transforms (12-2*3)*(10-2*3)=(12-6)*(10-6)=6*4=24 square meters into (12+3+12+3)*(10+3+10+3)=(15+15)*(13+13)=30*26=780 square meters, which erroneously increases the computed area.

The question requires the calculation of the new area of the rectangle after increasing each side by 100%, which is correctly given by the formula 2L*2W=4*L*W in the original_solution, reflecting the area as the length multiplied by the width. In the transformed_solution, however, step 3 incorrectly uses the formula 2L*2W as 4L+4W, which instead represents the perimeter of the rectangle, not the area. The area does not increase by adding the lengths and widths but by multiplying them, hence a perimeter formula has been incorrectly used in place of an area formula. This confusion changes the subsequent step 4 from 4*L*W - L*W = 3*L*W to 4L+4W - (2L+2W) = 2L+2W and also affects the final percentage calculation in step 5, changing it from (3*L*W)/(L*W) * 100% = 300% to ((2L+2W)/(2L+2W)) * 100% = 100%.
