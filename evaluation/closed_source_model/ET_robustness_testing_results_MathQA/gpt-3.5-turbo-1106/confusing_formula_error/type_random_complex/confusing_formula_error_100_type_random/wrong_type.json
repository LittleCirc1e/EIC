The question requires finding the perimeter, which is the sum of its sides, not finding the area, which is not relevant given the information about the side ratios and perimeter. The proper formula for finding x based on the perimeter and the side ratios is altered from the sum of the sides equal to the perimeter (x + 2x/3 + x/2 = 104) to the incorrect multiplication of the sides with the assumption that it equals the perimeter (x * 2x/3 * x/2 = 104) in the transformed_solution. As a consequence of this change in step 3, x is incorrectly derived as approximately 8.49 instead of the correct value of 48 in the original_solution. The error affects only the step where the perimeter is incorrectly treated as an area, while all other steps calculate correctly based on the mistaken assumption.
