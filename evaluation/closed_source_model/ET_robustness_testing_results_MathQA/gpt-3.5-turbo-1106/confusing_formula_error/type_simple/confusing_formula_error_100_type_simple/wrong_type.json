        "question": "Two cubes each with side b are joined to form a cuboid. What is the surface area of this cuboid?",
        "original_solution": "The surface area of the cuboid is 2*(l*w + w*h + h*l) where l, w, and h are the dimensions of the cuboid\nThe dimensions of the cuboid formed by joining the two cubes are 2b, b, and b\nSo the surface area of the cuboid is 2*(2b*b + b*b + b*2b) = 2*(2b^2 + b^2 + 2b^2) = 2*(5b^2) = 10b^2\n#### 10b^2",
        "original_answer": "10b^2",
        "transformed_solution": "The volume of the cuboid is (l*w*h) where l, w, and h are the dimensions of the cuboid\nThe dimensions of the cuboid formed by joining the two cubes are 2b, b, and b\nSo the volume of the cuboid is (2b*b*b) = 2b^3\n#### 2b^3",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the formula for surface area and volume of a cuboid. The question asks for the surface area, requiring the use of the formula 2*(l*w + w*h + h*l), but the transformed solution incorrectly uses the volume formula (l*w*h). The language description of step 1 < The surface area of the cuboid is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. However, the calculation changes to reflect volume instead, which affects the answer in the transformed_solution. In this example, only step 1 mistakes the formula for the cuboid surface area, while the other steps, including the language used and calculations, correctly calculate volume based on the revised step 1.",

        "pred_wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "type_explanation": "The error is in the operator of the formula in the first wrong step, as the volume of the cuboid should be calculated using the formula V = l * w * h, but the solution incorrectly uses the formula for the volume of a cube, V = s^3, where s is the side length of the cube."

        "question": "A cube has a volume of 64 cubic feet. If a similar cube is twice as long, twice as wide, and twice as high, then the volume, in cubic feet, of such cube is?",
        "original_solution": "Let the original side length be x.\nThe original volume of the cube is x^3=64\nSolving for x, we find x=4\nThe new side length is 2x=2*4=8\nThe new volume of the cube is (2x)^3=8^3=512\n#### 512",

        "transformed_solution": "Let the original side length be x.\nThe original volume of the cube is 3*x*x=64\nSolving for x, we find x is approximately 4.62\nThe new side length is 2x=2*4.62=9.24\nThe new volume of the cube is (2x)^3=9.24^3=787.305\n#### 787.305",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the volume and surface area of a cube. The question requires that the volume of the cube to be solved be equal to the side length cubed, not 3 times the square of the side length, which is a dimensionally incorrect representation of surface area (and not even the correct formula for surface area). This error results in the original equation x^3=64 being replaced by 3*x*x=64, thus solving for x gives an incorrect value, approximately 4.62 instead of the correct 4. The subsequent steps apply the incorrect side length to determine the new cube's measurements and volume. Therefore, step 2 from  x^3=64 has been modified to 3*x*x=64 in the transformed_solution, and this single incorrect application of a formula results in a subsequently incorrect computed volume of 787.305 cubic feet instead of the correct 512 cubic feet. The language description in step 2, <The original volume of the cube is> remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. All other operations and calculations remain correct, adhering to the instruction to only modify one step.",

        "pred_wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "type_explanation": "The error is in the unit conversion when calculating the new volume of the cube. The formula for the volume of a cube is V = s^3, where s is the side length. The new side length is 2x, so the correct calculation for the new volume should be (2x)^3, not 9.24^3. This incorrect unit conversion leads to the final wrong result."
