        "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the area formula of a rectangle with the perimeter formula. The problem asks to calculate the area which should be computed by multiplying length by width. In the transformed solution, we mistakenly add all four sides together, 12 + 5 + 12 + 5, which is how one would calculate the perimeter, not the area. The step's language description 'So, the area of the garden is' remains the same as in the original solution even though the calculation uses the wrong formula. Just one step (step 2) includes the formula error, while all other calculation processes are still correct. This error leads to the subsequent answer being different from the original answer.",

        "pred_wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 confuses the area and perimeter formulas of rectangle, and it should calculate the area of the rectangle which is equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the length plus length plus width plus width, equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle. Therefore, it belongs to confusing_formula_error."

        "explanation": "Here, step 4 confuses the area and perimeter of triangle. The question requires that the area of the triangle to be solved be equal to the base multiplied by height divided by 2, rather than the sum of the sides of the triangle, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the triangle, resulting in (3 * 4) / 2 = 6 square units in the original_solution becoming (3 + 4 + 5) = 12 units in the transformed_solution. This does not affect any previous steps because they all correctly calculate the height using the Pythagorean theorem. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 4 mistakenly replaces the formula for triangle area with the formula for triangle perimeter, while the other calculation processes are still correct.",

It should calculate the area of the triangle using the formula (base * height) / 2, instead of calculating the perimeter of the triangle.

Instead of calculating the area using the correct formula (1/2) * base * height, the transformed_solution inaccurately uses a simple addition of base and height, which is not a formula for any geometrical measurement, resulting in the wrong calculation of 4 + 5 = 9 square meters. This is the first step in the transformed_solution, and no subsequent steps are present to be affected. This approach reflects a single error in the solution process where the description remains unchanged—the formula for calculating the area, however, is incorrectly transformed while the arithmetic operation based on the wrong formula is performed correctly.",
