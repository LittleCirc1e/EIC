        "original_solution": "There are 70-31 = 39 non-throwers.\nThere are 39/3 = 13 left-handed players.\nThere are 39 - 13 = 26 right-handed non-throwers.\nThere are 26 + 31 = 57 right-handed players in total.\n#### 57",
        "original_answer": 57.0,
        "transformed_solution": "There are 70/3 = 23 left-handed players.\nThere are 70 - 23 = 47 right-handed players in total.\n#### 47",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 of the original solution has been removed. Step 1 references the number 70 and 31 from the question, while step 2 references the result of step 1. Upon deletion of step 1, step 2 has been modified to directly reference the total number of players instead. However, the calculation in step 2 is incorrect because it should divide the number of non-throwers (70 - 31) rather than the total number of players. With step 1 missing, the calculation in the transformed solution incorrectly references the total number of players (70) when calculating left-handed players, which is incorrect because it omits subtracting the throwers (70 - 31) first. Following the instructions, I chose to use only the calculation involving the total number of players, but since we are removing the first step, this leads to an incorrect calculation for left-handed and consequently, right-handed players. The number of left-handed players is incorrectly calculated as 70/3 instead of (70 - 31)/3. The total right-handed players are calculated using this incorrect number, resulting in step 2 referencing an incorrect figure from the modified step 1. Therefore, the wrong_step is 1.",

After deleting the first step, the immediate next step becomes step 1 (previously step 2) and references directly the efficiency of a and b from the question. However, a mistake occurred in the calculation in the new step 2 (previously step 3) where 1/3 - 1/15 was incorrectly simplified as 2/15 instead of 4/15. This is an intentional calculation error. The final step is then adjusted to reflect this error, with the number of days c needs to finish the job alone being recalculated to 15/2 days, which results in a transformed answer of 7.5 days. The first step in the transformed solution that references the result of the deleted step is step 2, so the wrong_step is 2.",

Due to this, the distance traveled in the third interval equation changes to (2 + 5 * 2) * (5 / 60) in the transformed_solution.
