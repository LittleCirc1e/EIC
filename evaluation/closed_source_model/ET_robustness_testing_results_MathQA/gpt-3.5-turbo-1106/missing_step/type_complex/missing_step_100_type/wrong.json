        "original_solution": "The diesel required per km is 60 / 600 = 0.1 litres/km\nThe diesel required for 800 km is 0.1 x 800 = 80 litres\nThe diesel requirement is directly proportional to the engine capacity, so the diesel required for 1200 cc engine is 80 x 1200 / 800 = 120 litres\n#### 120",

It should be noted that the calculation of the new step after the transformation is still correct.

Step 1 of the original_solution originally involved adding the individual percentages of length and breadth reduction and also including the combined effect of the reductions. However, after deletion, the transformed_solution incorrectly only takes the product of the two percentage reductions (20% x 20%), which actually represents the combined effect, not the entire decrease in area. The combined effect has been mistaken for the total decrease in area, resulting in a calculation that only considers the intersection of the length and breadth reductions. The transformed_solution, therefore, does not add the individual percentage reductions of length and breadth, hence arriving at an incorrect answer of 4%. The first step, which would have been referencing the individual and combined reductions correctly, is now missing.",
