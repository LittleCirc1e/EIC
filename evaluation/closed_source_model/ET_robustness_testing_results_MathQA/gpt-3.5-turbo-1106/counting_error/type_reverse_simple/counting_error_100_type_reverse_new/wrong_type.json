        "explanation": "Here, step 1 erroneously counts the number of workdays as 4 instead of 5, excluding one of the 8-hour workdays. This alteration changes the total hours worked in the week from 36 to 28, leading to an incorrect calculation of the hourly wage in the later step, which changes from $396 / 36 hours = $11 per hour to $396 / 28 hours = $14.14 per hour. It should be noted that only the first step contains a counting error, and subsequent calculations are based on this mistake; however, these calculations are performed correctly based on the altered inputs.",
