        "original_solution": "Let t be the time in minutes after the gears start rotating.\nAfter t minutes, gear p will have made 10t revolutions and gear q will have made 40t revolutions.\nWe need to find t such that 40t = 10t + 5\nSolving for t: 30t = 5, t = 5/30 = 1/6\nIn seconds, 1/6 minutes is 1/6 * 60 = 10 seconds.\n#### 10",
