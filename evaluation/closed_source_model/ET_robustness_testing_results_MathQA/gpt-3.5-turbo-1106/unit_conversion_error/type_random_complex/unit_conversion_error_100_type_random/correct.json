        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes an incorrect unit conversion, stating there are 50 minutes in an hour instead of the correct 60 minutes. This error affects the ratio calculation, changing the correct ratio of 12 minutes to 1 hour from 12/60 = 1/5 to an incorrect value of 12/50 = 6/25 in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that only one step of unit conversion error is considered, and subsequent steps that are directly affected by the error are adjusted accordingly without affecting the previous or unrelated steps.",

Step 1 performs an incorrect unit conversion and mistakenly assumes that one hour has 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes, which only results in an error in one operand in the formula, thus it belongs to unit_conversion_error. Step 2, as its subsequent step, references the erroneous result of step 1, resulting in the incorrect final answer."

        "original_solution": "In 1 minute, Kramer can pack 10 boxes, so in 1 minute, he can pack 10/5 = 2 cases.\nIn 2 hours, there are 2 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 120 minutes.\nSo, in 2 hours, Kramer can pack 2 cases per minute * 120 minutes = 240 cases.\n#### 240",

        "question": "Excluding stoppages, the speed of a bus is 54 kmph and including stoppages, it is 36 kmph. For how many minutes does the bus stop per hour?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the time the bus stops per hour.\nAccording to the given information, the distance covered excluding stoppages is the same as that including stoppages. Therefore, the time taken excluding stoppages is less than the time taken including stoppages.\nDistance = speed x time\nThe speed of the bus without stoppages is 54 kmph, and with stoppages is 36 kmph, which means the bus covers 18 km less in an hour when it stops.\nTo find out for how long the bus stops, we calculate the difference in distance traveled: 54 km/h - 36 km/h = 18 km/h difference.\nThis difference of 18 km occurs because the bus is stopping for some time during the hour. To convert this lost distance back into time, we find out the fraction of the hour the bus stoppages take, which is the difference in speed (18 km/h) divided by the original speed (54 km/h).\nThis gives us 18/54 of an hour the bus is stopped. To convert this fraction to minutes, we multiply by 60 minutes/hour.\nThus, the bus stops for (18/54) * 60 minutes per hour = 20 minutes per hour.\n#### 20",
