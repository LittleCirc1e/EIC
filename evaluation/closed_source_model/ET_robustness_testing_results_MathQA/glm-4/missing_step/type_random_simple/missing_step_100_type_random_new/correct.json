        "explanation": "Here, step 1 of the original solution has been removed. Step 1 references the number 70 and 31 from the question, while step 2 references the result of step 1. Upon deletion of step 1, step 2 has been modified to directly reference the total number of players instead. However, the calculation in step 2 is incorrect because it should divide the number of non-throwers (70 - 31) rather than the total number of players. With step 1 missing, the calculation in the transformed solution incorrectly references the total number of players (70) when calculating left-handed players, which is incorrect because it omits subtracting the throwers (70 - 31) first. Following the instructions, I chose to use only the calculation involving the total number of players, but since we are removing the first step, this leads to an incorrect calculation for left-handed and consequently, right-handed players. The number of left-handed players is incorrectly calculated as 70/3 instead of (70 - 31)/3. The total right-handed players are calculated using this incorrect number, resulting in step 2 referencing an incorrect figure from the modified step 1. Therefore, the wrong_step is 1.",

This results in an incorrect number of chocolate bars (25 instead of 375). The erroneous result is carried on from the first step, making it the wrong_step.

Due to this, the distance traveled in the third interval equation changes to (2 + 5 * 2) * (5 / 60) in the transformed_solution.
