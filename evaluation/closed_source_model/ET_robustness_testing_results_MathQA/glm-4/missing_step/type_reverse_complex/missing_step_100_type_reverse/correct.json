The subsequent steps each perform a calculation based on the result of the previous step, so by removing step 1 from the original solution, we also remove the '2/3' multiple from the calculations. Step 2 of the original solution is now modified to directly calculate the number of birds after 2/5 leave based on the original total x rather than the subtotal after 1/3 have flown away. Step 3 now incorrectly represents the step after 2/3 leave from an amount that was 3/5 of the original x. Step 4 then incorrectly calculates the total number of birds based on the erroneous preceding step. Since the removal of step 1 causes the error in transformed step 1 which is originally step 2, the wrong_step is 1.",

This error belongs to missing_step because it skips a necessary calculation step that would affect all subsequent steps."

We now directly connect the logical structure with the remaining steps, stating that n must be greater than the result from step 1 and less than the result from step 4, without explicitly solving for these values, which leads to n > 3 and n < 7.

It is expressed as \">3<n<7\" instead of \"3<n<7\" to emphasize the open interval notation while the inequality still holds true.
