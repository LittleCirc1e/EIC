By skipping the proportion setup phase, the subsequent calculation uses direct cross-multiplication without stating the reason, jumping into the arithmetic part: 0.75*8 = 5*x. As the deleted step does not produce a numerical result for reference, and it's an intermediate step where the following step correctly references the numbers from the question, we use those numbers (0.75 and 8, choosing the larger one, which is 8) directly for the cross-multiplication. However, while the arithmetic operation in the transformed step 1 is correct, the ensuing calculation in step 2 incorrectly divides by 5 when it should correctly divide by 5 as in the original solution (and originally explained in the deleted step) but does not. As a consequence of this error, the derived answer of 1.5 in the transformed answer is distinct from the correct original answer of 1.2.
