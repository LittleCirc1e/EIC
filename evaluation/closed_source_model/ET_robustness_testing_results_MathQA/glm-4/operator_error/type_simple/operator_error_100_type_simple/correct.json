Since this new equation has a positive constant term and the coefficients of x^2 and x have opposite signs, the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, making it impossible for the equation to have real solutions. All steps following the operator change are consistent with the new equation, but the result is entirely different from the original solution, which leads to 'No Real Solution' as the answer.",
