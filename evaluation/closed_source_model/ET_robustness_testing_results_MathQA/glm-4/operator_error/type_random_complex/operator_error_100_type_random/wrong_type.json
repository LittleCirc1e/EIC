        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this example, the multiplication operator in step 1 has been changed to division, thus incorrectly calculating the number of girls as 160 / 1/2 = 320 instead of 160 x 1/2 = 80. This results in an impossible count of boys, calculated in step 2 as 160 - 320 = -160, which is not a feasible number of students. The original count was 80 boys, so the transformation caused by the operator error in step 1 led to a nonsensical answer. Every step's calculation is correct except for the incorrect application of the operator in step 1.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 2. The calculation in step 2 is incorrect. It incorrectly calculates the number of girls by dividing the total number of students by 1/2, which should instead multiply the total number of students by 1/2 to get the correct number of girls. This leads to an overestimation of the number of girls and a subsequent incorrect calculation of the number of boys, resulting in a negative number which is not possible."
