        "question": "when the number 9 y 30012 is exactly divisible by 11 , what is the smallest whole number that can replace y ?",
        "original_solution": "To find out if the number is exactly divisible by 11, we find the alternating sum of the digits, i.e. 9 - y + 3 - 0 + 0 - 1 + 2 = 13 - y. This sum must be divisible by 11.\nSo, 13 - y must be divisible by 11. \nIn order for this to be true, the smallest whole number that can replace y is 2, because 13 - 2 = 11, which is divisible by 11.\n#### 2",

        "transformed_solution": "To find out if the number is exactly divisible by 11, we find the alternating sum of the digits, i.e. 9 + y + 3 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 15 + y. This sum must be divisible by 11.\nSo, 15 + y must be divisible by 11. \nIn order for this to be true, the smallest whole number that can replace y is -4 because 15 + (-4) = 11, which is divisible by 11.\n#### -4",

        "explanation": "In the original solution, the process to find if the number is divisible by 11 involved the alternating sum of the digits. The operation at step 1 was changed from subtraction to addition, altering 9 - y to 9 + y. This error carries through the subsequent steps, changing the sum from 13 - y to 15 + y. Then, to find the smallest whole number y that results in the sum being divisible by 11, we incorrectly replace y with -4, so that 15 + (-4) equals 11. However, since negative digits are not possible in a number, and the scope of the question asks for the smallest whole number, this transformation breaks the constraints of the question. Nonetheless, assuming all other logic remains sound, the calculation of 15 + (-4) is executed correctly, and only the transformed operation in the first step is incorrect.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_type": "none",
        "type_explanation": "The solution is correct because it correctly applies the alternating sum method to find the smallest whole number that can replace y in the given number 9y30012 to make it exactly divisible by 11. The solution correctly calculates the alternating sum of the digits as 15+y and then determines that 15+y must be divisible by 11. It then correctly concludes that the smallest whole number that can replace y is -4 because 15+(-4)=11, which is divisible by 11. The solution is correct and there are no errors in the reasoning or calculations."

        "explanation": "This example changes the subtraction in step 1 to addition, turning (12-6)/2 to (12+6)/2. This affects the calculation of height h, as h = sqrt(5^2 - ((12+6)/2)^2) turns into sqrt(25 - 81). Since the result under the square root becomes negative (-56), there is no real solution for the height h. As a result, the area A cannot be computed due to the lack of a real value for the height. All other steps retain the original form of calculation, but since the height h is not real, the final area A is not computable.",
