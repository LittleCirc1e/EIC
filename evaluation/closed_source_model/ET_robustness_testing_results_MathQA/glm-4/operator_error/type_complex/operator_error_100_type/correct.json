        "explanation": "This example turns the multiplication in step 1 into addition by changing 'x' to '+', which subsequently changes '123 x ? = 62976' to '123 + ? = 62976'. The next step involves calculating the value of '?', which changes from '62976 / 123' in the original solution to '62976 - 123' in the transformed solution. Consequently, the result changes from '? = 512' to '? = 62853'. It should be noted that the only operator in step 1 is incorrect, but its calculation is done correctly, leading to a different result from the original answer. The rest of the calculations are correct based on the transformed step.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 1. The operator used should be division, not addition, as the question is asking for a division problem. The formula should be 62976 รท 123 = ? instead of 123 + ? = 62976. This is an operator error because the operator is incorrect, leading to an incorrect approach to solve the problem."
