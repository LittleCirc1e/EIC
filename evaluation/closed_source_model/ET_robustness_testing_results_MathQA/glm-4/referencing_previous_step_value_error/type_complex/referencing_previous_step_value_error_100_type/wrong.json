        "explanation": "Step 9 mistakenly adds 300 to 1500 as 2000 instead of the correct sum of 1800. It should be noted that step 8 in the transformed_solution <x = 1500> should be the same as the step 8 in the original_solution <x = 1500> and calculates its result 1500 correctly. The subsequent step 9 should be affected by step 8 and retain the correct calculation method by adding x to 300, but only the number to be added to 300 was changed from 1500 to 1500 incorrectly resulting in 2000 instead of the correct 1800. All other arithmetic in the solution is applied correctly with only the arithmetic operation in step 9 being incorrect, and this is the only step with a mistake, leading to a different transformed answer from the original answer.",
