        "original_solution": "The speed in the third interval is 2 + (5 * 2) = 12 miles per hour\nThe distance traveled in the third interval is 12 * (5 / 60) = 1 mile\n#### 1",
        "original_answer": 1.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The speed in the third interval is 2 + (5 * 2) = 12 miles per hour\nThe distance traveled in the third interval is 12 * (5 / 60) = 0.5 miles\n#### 0.5",

The incorrect division leads to a halved answer even though the previous step calculated the interval speed correctly. All other steps that should reference the correct result of the third interval speed, continue to reference the figure correctly.",

        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 2. The calculation in step 2 is incorrect. To find the distance traveled in the third 5-minute interval, the formula should be distance = speed * time. The speed in the third interval is correctly calculated as 2 + (5 * 2) = 12 miles per hour. However, the time is incorrectly used as 5 minutes instead of converting it to hours (5 minutes is 5/60 hours). The correct calculation should be 12 * (5/60) = 1 mile, not 0.5 miles. Therefore, the error in step 2 is a calculation_error."

This error only affects the final step where the x-value is calculated. Steps 1, 2, and 3 are correct and consistent with the original solution. The reference number in the correct step 3 is 796, which is incorrectly used in step 4 to obtain x=198. Steps 1, 2, and 3 still reference their numbers correctly. The wrong_step (4), the calculation error which is the wrong_type, and an explanation indicating that it was an arithmetic mistake while dividing 796 by 4 that led to the error are provided.
