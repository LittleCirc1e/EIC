        "question": "two circular signs are to be painted. If the diameter of the larger sign is 7 times that of the smaller sign, how many times more paint is needed to paint the larger sign? (we can assume that a given amount of paint covers the same area on both signs.)",
        "original_solution": "The area of a circle is calculated using the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle.\nThe area of the larger sign is π(7r)^2, which simplifies to 49πr^2.\nThe area of the smaller sign is πr^2.\nTo find out how many times more paint is needed for the larger sign, we divide the area of the larger sign by the area of the smaller sign: 49πr^2 / πr^2 = 49 times more paint is needed.\n#### 49",
        "original_answer": 49.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The circumference of a circle is calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where r is the radius of the circle.\nThe circumference of the larger sign is 2π(7r), which simplifies to 14πr.\nThe circumference of the smaller sign is 2πr.\nTo find out how many times more paint is needed for the larger sign, we divide the circumference of the larger sign by the circumference of the smaller sign: 14πr / 2πr = 7 times more paint is needed.\n#### 7",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the area and circumference of a circle. The question requires that the area of the circle to be solved be equal to π multiplied by the radius squared, rather than 2 times π multiplied by radius, which is equivalent to the circumference of the circle, resulting in an area  calculation π(7r)^2 in the original_solution becoming a circumference calculation 2π(7r) in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 4, changing from dividing areas (49πr^2 / πr^2 = 49) to dividing circumferences (14πr / 2πr = 7). Note that the language description of the process in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that only one step in the original_solution is altered to confuse the formula, and other steps are kept correct.",
