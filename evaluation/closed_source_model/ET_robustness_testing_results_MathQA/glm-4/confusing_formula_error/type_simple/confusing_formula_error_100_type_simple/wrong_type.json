        "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the volume and area of a cube. The question requires that the volume of the cube to be solved be equal to the side cubed, rather than the side squared, which is equivalent to the area of a face of the cube, resulting in (2x)^3=8x^3 in the original_solution becoming (2x)^2=4x^2 in the transformed_solution. This affects the ratio calculated in the last step, changing from 8x^3 : 27x^3 to 4x^2 : 27x^3. Note that the language description of step 2 < The volume of the first cube is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 2 mistakenly uses the formula for the area of a square face of the cube, while the other steps correctly use the formula for the cube volume, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the volume and surface area of a cube. The question requires that the volume of the cube to be solved be equal to the side length cubed, not 3 times the square of the side length, which is a dimensionally incorrect representation of surface area (and not even the correct formula for surface area). This error results in the original equation x^3=64 being replaced by 3*x*x=64, thus solving for x gives an incorrect value, approximately 4.62 instead of the correct 4. The subsequent steps apply the incorrect side length to determine the new cube's measurements and volume. Therefore, step 2 from  x^3=64 has been modified to 3*x*x=64 in the transformed_solution, and this single incorrect application of a formula results in a subsequently incorrect computed volume of 787.305 cubic feet instead of the correct 512 cubic feet. The language description in step 2, <The original volume of the cube is> remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. All other operations and calculations remain correct, adhering to the instruction to only modify one step.",
