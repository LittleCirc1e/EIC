        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 5. The formula used to calculate the error percentage in the area is incorrect. The error should be calculated based on the difference between the actual area and the calculated area, divided by the actual area, and then multiplied by 100. However, the solution incorrectly divides by 4*x twice, which effectively cancels out the extra area added by the error, leading to an incorrect result of 4%. This is a calculation_error because the operands and operators are correct, but the calculation process is incorrect."

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the volume and surface area of a cube. The question requires that the volume of the cube to be solved be equal to the side length cubed, not 3 times the square of the side length, which is a dimensionally incorrect representation of surface area (and not even the correct formula for surface area). This error results in the original equation x^3=64 being replaced by 3*x*x=64, thus solving for x gives an incorrect value, approximately 4.62 instead of the correct 4. The subsequent steps apply the incorrect side length to determine the new cube's measurements and volume. Therefore, step 2 from  x^3=64 has been modified to 3*x*x=64 in the transformed_solution, and this single incorrect application of a formula results in a subsequently incorrect computed volume of 787.305 cubic feet instead of the correct 512 cubic feet. The language description in step 2, <The original volume of the cube is> remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. All other operations and calculations remain correct, adhering to the instruction to only modify one step.",

        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 2. The formula used to calculate the original volume of the cube is incorrect. It should be x^3 instead of 3*x*x. This results in an incorrect calculation of the side length x and the subsequent volume of the larger cube. The error is a calculation_error because the operands and operators are correct, but the result is calculated incorrectly."
