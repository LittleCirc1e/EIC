We have to recalculate the error percentage based on the incorrect area calculation, yielding a transformed answer of 4%. Note that the language description of step 3 in the original solution <The actual area of the square is > remains unchanged in the transformed solution. The other steps related to calculation in the transformed solution are adjusted accordingly to maintain logical coherence after the initial error.",

        "pred_wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "type_explanation": "The error percentage in the calculated area is incorrectly calculated. The correct calculation should be ((1.04x)^2 - x^2) / x^2 * 100, not (4.16x - 4*x) / 4*x * 100 as done in the solution."
