        "question": "sheila works 8 hours per day on monday, wednesday and friday, and 6 hours per day on tuesday and thursday. she does not work on saturday and sunday. she earns $504 per week. how much does she earn in dollars per hour?",
        "original_solution": "On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday she works 8 hours/day, so in total 8 * 3 = 24 hours\nOn Tuesday and Thursday she works 6 hours/day, so in total 6 * 2 = 12 hours\nThe total hours she works in a week is 24 + 12 = 36 hours\nTo find her hourly wage, we divide her weekly earnings by the total hours worked, 504 / 36 = 14\n#### 14",
        "original_answer": 14.0,
        "transformed_solution": "On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday she works 8 hours/day, so in total 8 * 2 = 16 hours\nOn Tuesday and Thursday she works 6 hours/day, so in total 6 * 2 = 12 hours\nThe total hours she works in a week is 16 + 12 = 28 hours\nTo find her hourly wage, we divide her weekly earnings by the total hours worked, 504 / 28 = 18\n#### 18",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The mistake happens in step 1 where it counts Monday, Wednesday, and Friday as 2 days instead of 3 days, resulting in 8 * 3 = 24 hours becoming 8 * 2 = 16 hours. The subsequent step 3 and 4 that rely on the total hours are affected: step 3 changes from 24 + 12 = 36 hours to 16 + 12 = 28 hours, and step 4 changes from 504 / 36 = 14 to 504 / 28 = 18. It should be noted that only the counting in step 1 is incorrect; the other calculation processes thereafter are still correct.",

        "pred_wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 1. Step 1 incorrectly counts the number of days for which Sheila works 8 hours as 2 days instead of 3 days, leading to an underestimation of the total hours worked. This is a counting_error. Step 3, as the subsequent step of step 1, references the incorrect result of step 1, resulting in the incorrect final answer."

        "question": "A factory produces 5500 toys per week. If the workers at this factory work 4 days a week and if these workers make the same number of toys everyday, how many toys are produced each day?",
        "original_solution": "The total number of toys produced per week is 5500 toys\nThe total number of days worked per week is 4 days\nThe number of toys produced each day is 5500 / 4 = 1375 toys\n#### 1375",
        "original_answer": 1375.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total number of toys produced per week is 5500 toys\nThe total number of days worked per week is 5 days\nThe number of toys produced each day is 5500 / 5 = 1100 toys\n#### 1100",

        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",

        "explanation": "The second step in the transformed_solution incorrectly states that the total number of days worked per week is 5 days instead of the original 4 days from the original_solution. This counting error directly impacts the third step, changing it from a correct division of 5500 toys by 4 days to an incorrect division of 5500 toys by 5 days, leading to a different value of toys produced each day (1100 instead of 1375). It is important to note that only the number of days counted is changed, leaving the previous and unrelated steps unaffected as well as ensuring that the transformed_answer (1100) is different from the original_answer (1375).",

        "pred_wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 incorrectly states that the total number of days worked per week is 5 days, while the question clearly states that the workers work 4 days a week. This results in an incorrect operand in the formula, leading to an incorrect final answer. Therefore, it belongs to counting_error."

        "explanation": "In the transformed_solution, the counting result has been erroneously altered by excluding the number 57, which should have been included as it is less than 60 and leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4.

        "original_solution": "In a month of 30 days, there will be 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays\nThe second Saturday and every Sunday are holidays, so there will be 2 Saturdays and 4 Sundays off\nTherefore, the total number of working days will be 30 - 2(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 24 days\n#### 24",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 incorrectly increases the number of Saturdays off from 2 to 3. The wrong step caused an overcounting error in the number of holidays (Saturdays off), and it further impacts the calculation in step 3, changing it from 30 - 2(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 24 to 30 - 3(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 23. This is the step where the counting error is made, and the other steps remain correctly calculated based on the progression of the transformed_solution, leading to a transformed_answer of 23 days which differs from the original_answer.",

        "pred_wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 2. The solution counts the second Saturday as a holiday but still counts the other 3 Saturdays as working days, which is a counting error. Since the second Saturday is a holiday, all 4 Saturdays should be considered as non-working days. The subsequent step incorrectly references the count of working Saturdays, leading to an incorrect final answer."
