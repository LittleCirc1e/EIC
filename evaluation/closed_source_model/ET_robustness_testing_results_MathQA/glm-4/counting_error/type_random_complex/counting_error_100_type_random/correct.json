        "original_answer": 67.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total of marks obtained by reeya is 55 + 67 + 76 + 82 + 55 = 335\nThe total number of subjects is 4\nThe average marks obtained by reeya is 335 / 4 = 83.75\n#### 83.75",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 erroneously counts the number of subjects as 4 instead of 5. This counting error results in the incorrect calculation of the average in step 3, which changes from 335 / 5 = 67 to 335 / 4 = 83.75. The rest of the steps in the transformed_solution and the calculations done before the wrong step in the original_solution are correct, which keeps the error isolated to a single instance.",

        "pred_wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 2. The total number of subjects is incorrectly stated as 4 instead of 5, which leads to an error in the count of subjects. This error affects the subsequent step that calculates the average, resulting in an incorrect final answer."

        "question": "A factory produces 5500 toys per week. If the workers at this factory work 4 days a week and if these workers make the same number of toys everyday, how many toys are produced each day?",
        "original_solution": "The total number of toys produced per week is 5500 toys\nThe total number of days worked per week is 4 days\nThe number of toys produced each day is 5500 / 4 = 1375 toys\n#### 1375",

        "transformed_solution": "The total number of toys produced per week is 5500 toys\nThe total number of days worked per week is 5 days\nThe number of toys produced each day is 5500 / 5 = 1100 toys\n#### 1100",

This counting error directly impacts the third step, changing it from a correct division of 5500 toys by 4 days to an incorrect division of 5500 toys by 5 days, leading to a different value of toys produced each day (1100 instead of 1375). It is important to note that only the number of days counted is changed, leaving the previous and unrelated steps unaffected as well as ensuring that the transformed_answer (1100) is different from the original_answer (1375).",

        "original_solution": "In a month of 30 days, there will be 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays\nThe second Saturday and every Sunday are holidays, so there will be 2 Saturdays and 4 Sundays off\nTherefore, the total number of working days will be 30 - 2(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 24 days\n#### 24",
        "original_answer": 24,
        "transformed_solution": "In a month of 30 days, there will be 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays\nThe second Saturday and every Sunday are holidays, so there will be 3 Saturdays and 4 Sundays off\nTherefore, the total number of working days will be 30 - 3(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 23 days\n#### 23",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 incorrectly increases the number of Saturdays off from 2 to 3. The wrong step caused an overcounting error in the number of holidays (Saturdays off), and it further impacts the calculation in step 3, changing it from 30 - 2(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 24 to 30 - 3(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 23.

The division by the number of days (which was 5 in reality but mistakenly counted as 4) is not relevant for the calculation of the percentage of books not sold.
