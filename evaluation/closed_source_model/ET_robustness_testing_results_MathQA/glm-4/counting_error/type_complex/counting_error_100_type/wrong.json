        "original_solution": "The reduced rates apply from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. on weekdays, which is 12 hours per day for 5 days (Monday to Friday), so 12 * 5 = 60 hours\nThe reduced rates also apply for 24 hours on Saturdays and Sundays, which is 24 * 2 = 48 hours\nThe total hours for which reduced rates apply is 60 + 48 = 108 hours\nThere are 24 hours in a day and 7 days in a week, so the total hours in a week is 24 * 7 = 168 hours\nThe fraction of a week for which reduced rates apply is 108 / 168 = 9 / 14\n#### 9/14",
