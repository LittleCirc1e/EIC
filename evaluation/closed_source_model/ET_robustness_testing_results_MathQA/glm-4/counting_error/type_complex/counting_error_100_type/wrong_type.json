        "question": "the average temperature for tuesday , wednesday and thursday was 52 ° c . the average temperature for wednesday , thursday and friday was 54 ° c . if the temperature on friday be 53 ° c , what was the temperature on tuesday ?",
        "original_solution": "The total temperature for Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday is 52 * 3 = 156 °C\nThe total temperature for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday is 54 * 3 = 162 °C\nThe total temperature for Friday is 53 °C\nTherefore, the total temperature for Wednesday and Thursday is 162 - 53 = 109 °C\nSo the temperature for Tuesday is 156 - 109 = 47 °C\n#### 47",
        "original_answer": 47.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total temperature for Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday is 52 * 3 = 156 °C\nThe total temperature for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday is 54 * 2 = 108 °C\nThe total temperature for Friday is 53 °C\nTherefore, the total temperature for Wednesday and Thursday is 108 - 53 = 55 °C\nSo the temperature for Tuesday is 156 - 55 = 101 °C\n#### 101",

        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 erroneously counts Wednesday and Thursday as 2 days instead of 3 days when calculating the total temperature for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, which results in the calculation becoming 54 * 2 = 108 °C instead of 54 * 3 = 162 °C. This error affects the subsequent related steps; step 4 changes from 162 - 53 = 109 °C to 108 - 53 = 55 °C, and step 5 changes from 156 - 109 = 47 °C to 156 - 55 = 101 °C. The initial counting error impacts the conclusion while the previous steps remain unaffected.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_type": "referencing_previous_step_value_error",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 4. Step 4 references the result of step 3, which is the total temperature for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, but it should reference the result of step 2, which is the total temperature for Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. This error only results in an error in one operand in the formula, so it belongs to referencing_previous_step_value_error. Step 5, as the subsequent step of step 4, references the wrong result of step 4, resulting in the incorrect final answer."
