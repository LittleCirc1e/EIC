        "explanation": "In the transformed_solution, a miscalculation is introduced in step 6 where the correct operation 1000-100 is mistakenly changed to yield 600 - 800 instead of 600 - 900. This intentional error propagates down to step 7, changing the equation to -0.025x = -200 from the correct -0.025x = -300, which in turn affects the final step where the sales worth is erroneously found to be Rs. 8000 instead of Rs. 12000.
