        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 2. The list of multiples of 9 less than 50 is correct, but the count is incorrect. There are 5 positive integers less than 50 that are multiples of 9, not 6. The error in counting results in an incorrect final answer, so it belongs to counting_error."
