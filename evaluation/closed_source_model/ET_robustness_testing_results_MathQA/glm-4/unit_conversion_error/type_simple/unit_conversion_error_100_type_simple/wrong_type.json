        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 4 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 minute is wrongly equal to 50 seconds instead of 60 seconds, resulting in 1/6 * 60 = 10 seconds in the original_solution becoming 1/6 * 50 = 8.33 seconds in the transformed_solution. The error only affects the unit conversion for representing minutes into seconds and does not affect the algebraic operation or the process to find t, as that remains correct.",
