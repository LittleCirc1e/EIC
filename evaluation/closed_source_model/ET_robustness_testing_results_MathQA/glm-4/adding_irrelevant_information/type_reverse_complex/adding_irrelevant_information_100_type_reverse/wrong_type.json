The solution incorrectly adds 35 to the sum of the children's ages, which is not necessary because the question already states that the sum of their ages is 65 years. The error is in referencing the context value incorrectly by adding an extra 35, which belongs to referencing_context_value_error. Step 5, as the subsequent step, references the wrong result of step 4, leading to the incorrect final answer."

The transformed_solution includes this irrelevant additional information, changing the number of muffins from 10 in the original_solution to 11 in the transformed_solution.

        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 incorrectly references the number of extra doughnuts as 5, when in fact there are no extra doughnuts mentioned in the question. The correct calculation should be based on the 50 doughnuts given in the question. Therefore, each part should be equal to 50 / 5 = 10, not 11. Since the muffins represent 1 part in the ratio, there should be 10 muffins, not 11. This error only affects the operand in the formula and belongs to referencing_context_value_error."
