However, the calculation in step 2 is incorrect because it should divide the number of non-throwers (70 - 31) rather than the total number of players. With step 1 missing, the calculation in the transformed solution incorrectly references the total number of players (70) when calculating left-handed players, which is incorrect because it omits subtracting the throwers (70 - 31) first. Following the instructions, I chose to use only the calculation involving the total number of players, but since we are removing the first step, this leads to an incorrect calculation for left-handed and consequently, right-handed players. The number of left-handed players is incorrectly calculated as 70/3 instead of (70 - 31)/3.
