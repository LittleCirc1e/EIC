        "explanation": "The first step of the original solution has been removed, assuming that it referenced directly from the question that a and b together finish the job in 15 days. After deleting the first step, the immediate next step becomes step 1 (previously step 2) and references directly the efficiency of a and b from the question. However, a mistake occurred in the calculation in the new step 2 (previously step 3) where 1/3 - 1/15 was incorrectly simplified as 2/15 instead of 4/15. This is an intentional calculation error. The final step is then adjusted to reflect this error, with the number of days c needs to finish the job alone being recalculated to 15/2 days, which results in a transformed answer of 7.5 days. The first step in the transformed solution that references the result of the deleted step is step 2, so the wrong_step is 2.",

        "explanation": "In this example, the first step has been omitted, and its calculations wrongly incorporated into a single transformed step. The increase in speed after two intervals (which should be 2 + 5 * 2 = 12 miles per hour) is correctly calculated, but the multiplication by the fraction representing 5 minutes in an hour (5/60) is incorrectly done. Due to this, the distance traveled in the third interval equation changes to (2 + 5 * 2) * (5 / 60) in the transformed_solution. Since the omission has led to a calculation error in the combined single step, the wrong_step is 1. The transformed answer of 2 miles is incorrect as the actual distance traveled in the third 5-minute interval should be 1 mile.",
