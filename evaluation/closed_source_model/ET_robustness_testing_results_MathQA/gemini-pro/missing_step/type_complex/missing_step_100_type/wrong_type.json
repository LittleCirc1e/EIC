        "original_solution": "She drove 50 miles in the first hour because 50 x 1 = 50\nShe drove 150 miles in the second part of the trip because (1 + 1/2) x 100 = 150\nShe drove 200 miles in all because 50 + 150 = 200\n#### 200",

        "explanation": "In this example, the first step which calculates how far Sarah drove in the first hour has been removed. The original step 1 resulted in 50 miles. In the transformed_solution, step 2 which originally added 50 miles from step 1 to 150 miles from what was step 2 in the original_solution must now be corrected to add 0 to 150 miles, since step 1 has been removed. This results in a total distance driven of 150 miles, as stated in the transformed_solution. The deletion of step 1 removes the reference to the number of miles driven in the first hour from the solution, which leads to an incorrect calculation of the total distance driven and a wrong transformed_answer of 150 miles, which is different from the original_answer of 200 miles. Therefore, the wrong_step is the rewritten step 2 in the transformed_solution.",

Therefore, subsequent steps need to start with the simplified form 2(x-390) and solve for x accordingly. Step 3 now directly equates 2(x-390) with 2x + 780, instead of 2x - 780 = 2x + 780. As a result, the subtraction operation in step 4 is incorrect, but it still reveals that the equation 2x - 780 = 2x + 780 cannot hold true unless the extra bananas (780) is balanced out by an equal amount on the other side of the equation (-780 = 780). Hence, in step 5, instead of equating -780 to 390, it should equate -780 to 780 to maintain this balance. Step 6 then incorrectly solves for x by dividing 780 by 2, which yields the incorrect answer of x = 390. The wrong_step is 2 because that is the first step in the transformed solution that incorrectly references the result of the deleted step (step 2 in the original solution).",
