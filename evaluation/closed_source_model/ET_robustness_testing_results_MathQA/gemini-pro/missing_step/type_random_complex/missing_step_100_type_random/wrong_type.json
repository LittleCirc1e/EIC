We remove the third step, which involves a simple reiteration of the equation from step 2. Because the deleted step is just an exact repetition and doesn't involve any calculation with new values, we need to update the formula in the next step to reflect an actual step of combining the two equations. The correct transformation to combine them would be to add the equations together before isolating terms. So we transform step 2 from -2a - 12b = 10b + 80 to (9a - b) - (-2a + 12b) = 10b + 80, and then simplify it to get 7a + 11b = 80.

As a result, the subtraction operation in step 4 is incorrect, but it still reveals that the equation 2x - 780 = 2x + 780 cannot hold true unless the extra bananas (780) is balanced out by an equal amount on the other side of the equation (-780 = 780). Hence, in step 5, instead of equating -780 to 390, it should equate -780 to 780 to maintain this balance.
