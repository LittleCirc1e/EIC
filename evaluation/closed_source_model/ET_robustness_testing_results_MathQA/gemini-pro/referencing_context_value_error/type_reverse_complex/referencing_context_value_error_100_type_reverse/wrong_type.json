Step 4 does not expand the square of the binomial (1+x) and incorrectly calculates the compound interest as 15000*(1+x)^2 - 15000, which is missing the term 15000*x^2. This error belongs to missing_step. Step 5, as the subsequent step of step 4, references the wrong result of step 4, resulting in the incorrect final answer."

As this is the root error, only this step is considered incorrect, and the following steps correctly apply the erroneous result from this step: Step 4 correctly subtracts -5/5 * x from 4/5 * x, giving -1/5 * x = 12, and Step 5 correctly solves for x, getting x = -60.
