        "explanation": "The second step in the transformed_solution incorrectly states that the total number of days worked per week is 5 days instead of the original 4 days from the original_solution. This counting error directly impacts the third step, changing it from a correct division of 5500 toys by 4 days to an incorrect division of 5500 toys by 5 days, leading to a different value of toys produced each day (1100 instead of 1375). It is important to note that only the number of days counted is changed, leaving the previous and unrelated steps unaffected as well as ensuring that the transformed_answer (1100) is different from the original_answer (1375).",

Step 2 mistakenly references the number 5 instead of 4 from the question, only resulting in an operand error in the formula, so it belongs to referencing_context_value_error. Step 3, as its subsequent step, references the wrong result of step 2, resulting in the incorrect final answer."

        "question": "one week , a certain truck rental lot had a total of 26 trucks , all of which were on the lot monday morning . if 50 % of the trucks that were rented out during the week were returned to the lot on or before saturday morning of that week , and if there were at least 14 trucks on the lot that saturday morning , what is the greatest number of different trucks that could have been rented out during the week ?",
        "original_solution": "The total number of trucks rented out during the week is 26 - 14 = 12 trucks\nSince 50% of the rented out trucks were returned by Saturday morning, the total number of trucks rented out during the week is 12 / (50/100) = 24 trucks\n#### 24",
        "original_answer": 24,
        "transformed_solution": "The total number of trucks rented out during the week is 26 - 13 = 13 trucks\nSince 50% of the rented out trucks were returned by Saturday morning, the total number of trucks rented out during the week is 13 / (50/100) = 26 trucks\n#### 26",

        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 erroneously counts the trucks on the lot as being 13 instead of 14 on Saturday morning, resulting in the calculation being changed from 26 - 14 = 12 trucks to 26 - 13 = 13 trucks. And it affects the subsequent related step, changing the computed total number of trucks rented out during the week from 24 to 26. It should be noted that only one step of counting error is considered, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",

        "pred_wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 3. Step 3 incorrectly calculates 13 / (50/100) as 26 instead of 26 / (50/100) = 52, which only results in an error in one operand in the formula, so it belongs to calculation_error."
