        "question": "on sunday , bill ran 4 more miles than he ran on saturday . julia did not run on saturday , but she ran twice the number of miles on sunday that bill ran on sunday . if bill and julia ran a total of 20 miles on saturday and sunday , how many miles did bill run on sunday ?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the number of miles bill ran on Saturday\nOn Sunday, Bill ran x + 4 miles\nJulia ran 2*(x+4) = 2x + 8 miles on Sunday\nThe total number of miles ran on Saturday and Sunday is x + (x+4) + (2x+8) = 20\nCombining like terms, 4x + 12 = 20\nSubtracting 12 from both sides gives 4x = 8\nDividing both sides by 4 gives x = 2\nSo, Bill ran x + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6 miles on Sunday\n#### 6",

        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the number of miles bill ran on Saturday\nOn Sunday, Bill ran x + 4 miles\nJulia ran 2*(x+4) = 2x + 8 miles on Sunday\nThe total number of miles ran on Saturday and Sunday is x + (x+4) + (2x+8) = 20\nCombining like terms, 4x + 12 = 20\nSubtracting 12 from both sides gives 4x = 8\nDividing both sides by 2 gives x = 4\nSo, Bill ran x + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8 miles on Sunday\n#### 8",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, a single arithmetic error is introduced in step 7 of the original_solution with the incorrect division by 2, giving x = 4. This error wrongly changes the conclusion that Bill ran 6 miles on Sunday to claiming he ran 8 miles on Sunday in the transformed_solution.",

        "question": "Gary’s gas station serves an average of 16 cars per hour on Saturdays, 10 cars per hour on Sundays, and 9 cars per hour on all other days of the week. If the station is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, how many cars does Gary’s station serve over the course of a typical week?",
        "original_solution": "On Saturdays, the station is open for 16 hours, so it serves 16 * 16 = 256 cars\nOn Sundays, the station is open for 16 hours, so it serves 16 * 10 = 160 cars\nFrom Monday to Friday, the station is open for (16 * 5) = 80 hours, so it serves 80 * 9 = 720 cars\nThe total number of cars served over the course of a typical week is 256 + 160 + 720 = 1136 cars\n#### 1136",
        "original_answer": 1136,
        "transformed_solution": "On Saturdays, the station is open for 16 hours, so it serves 16 * 16 = 256 cars\nOn Sundays, the station is open for 16 hours, so it serves 16 * 10 = 160 cars\nFrom Monday to Friday, the station is open for (15 * 5) = 75 hours, so it serves 75 * 9 = 675 cars\nThe total number of cars served over the course of a typical week is 256 + 160 + 675 = 1091 cars\n#### 1091",

        "wrong_step": 3,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 3 erroneously counts the number of hours the station is open from Monday to Friday as 15 hours per day instead of the correct 16 hours. This changes the calculation from (16 * 5) = 80 hours to (15 * 5) = 75 hours, and subsequently, the total number of cars served from Monday to Friday changes from 80 * 9 = 720 cars to 75 * 9 = 675 cars. The final step summing up the total number of cars served during the week is then affected, with the original 256 + 160 + 720 changing to 256 + 160 + 675, resulting in a different total of 1091 cars. The previous and unrelated steps remain unaffected and correct.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_type": "none",
        "type_explanation": "The solution is correct because it correctly calculates the number of cars served on Saturdays, Sundays, and other days of the week, and then adds these values together to get the total number of cars served over the course of a typical week."
