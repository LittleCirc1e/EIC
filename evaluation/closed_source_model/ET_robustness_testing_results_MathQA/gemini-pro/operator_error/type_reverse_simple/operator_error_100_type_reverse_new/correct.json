        "original_answer": 8.0,
        "transformed_solution": "It takes 8 minutes for 8 monkeys to eat 8 bananas because they eat 1 banana per monkey per minute.\nIt would take 8 * 3 = 24 minutes for 3 monkeys to eat 3 bananas because we incorrectly change the constant rate to be multiplied.\n#### 24",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example changes the correct assumption \"the rate of eating remains the same\" by incorrectly introducing multiplication to the duration in step 2, changing \"8 minutes\" to \"8 * 3 = 24 minutes\" for 3 monkeys to eat 3 bananas. This is a misguided application of the original principle that the number of monkeys and bananas doesn't change the rate of consumption per monkey. Only step 2 contains the introduced error, but its result is calculated correctly based on the incorrect operation. This doesn't affect the subsequent steps because there are no other computations dependent on step 2 in this simplified problem.",

        "explanation": "This example turns the multiplication in step 1 into addition by changing 'x' to '+', which subsequently changes '123 x ? = 62976' to '123 + ? = 62976'. The next step involves calculating the value of '?', which changes from '62976 / 123' in the original solution to '62976 - 123' in the transformed solution. Consequently, the result changes from '? = 512' to '? = 62853'.
