        "explanation": "This example turns the multiplication in step 1 into addition by changing 'x' to '+', which subsequently changes '123 x ? = 62976' to '123 + ? = 62976'. The next step involves calculating the value of '?', which changes from '62976 / 123' in the original solution to '62976 - 123' in the transformed solution. Consequently, the result changes from '? = 512' to '? = 62853'. It should be noted that the only operator in step 1 is incorrect, but its calculation is done correctly, leading to a different result from the original answer. The rest of the calculations are correct based on the transformed step.",

        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 1. Step 1 mistakenly uses addition instead of subtraction, and only one operator in the formula is incorrect, so it belongs to operator_error."
