        "explanation": "This example changes the subtraction in step 1 to addition, turning (12-6)/2 to (12+6)/2. This affects the calculation of height h, as h = sqrt(5^2 - ((12+6)/2)^2) turns into sqrt(25 - 81). Since the result under the square root becomes negative (-56), there is no real solution for the height h. As a result, the area A cannot be computed due to the lack of a real value for the height. All other steps retain the original form of calculation, but since the height h is not real, the final area A is not computable.",
