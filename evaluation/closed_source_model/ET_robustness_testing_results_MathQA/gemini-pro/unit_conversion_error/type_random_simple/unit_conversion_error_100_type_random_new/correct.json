        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes an incorrect unit conversion, stating there are 50 minutes in an hour instead of the correct 60 minutes. This error affects the ratio calculation, changing the correct ratio of 12 minutes to 1 hour from 12/60 = 1/5 to an incorrect value of 12/50 = 6/25 in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that only one step of unit conversion error is considered, and subsequent steps that are directly affected by the error are adjusted accordingly without affecting the previous or unrelated steps.",
