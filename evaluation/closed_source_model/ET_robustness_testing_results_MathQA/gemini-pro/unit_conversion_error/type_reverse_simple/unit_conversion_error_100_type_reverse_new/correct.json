        "original_solution": "The speed is calculated as distance / time. So, the speed is 80 feet / 4 seconds = 20 feet per second.\nTo convert feet per second to miles per hour, first convert feet to miles: 20 feet / 5280 feet per mile = 0.0037878788 miles per second.\nThen convert seconds to hours: 1 hour = 3600 seconds, so 0.0037878788 miles per second * 3600 = 13.64 miles per hour.\n#### 13.64",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 makes an incorrect unit conversion by stating that there are 5230 feet per mile instead of the correct 5280 feet per mile, resulting in the original_solution calculation 20 feet / 5280 feet per mile becoming 20 feet / 5230 feet per mile in the transformed_solution. The error affects the outcome of the second conversion step, changing from 0.0037878788 miles per second in the original_solution to 0.0038277512 miles per second in the transformed_solution. This incorrect conversion then propagates to the final calculation step where the speed in miles per second is multiplied by the correct number of seconds in an hour, affecting the subsequent related step and leading to a different transformed_answer of 13.78 miles per hour from the correct original_answer of 13.64 miles per hour.",
