        "explanation": "In this example, the wrong step is the final division (step 2), where it incorrectly divides 62976 by 120 instead of 123, leading to a transformed answer of approximately 524.67. The original multiplication step (step 1) remains unaffected because it precedes the incorrect division. There is only one error introduced, so it is considered a single error, and the explanation summarizes the error introduced and its impact on the subsequent step.",

        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 mistakenly uses division instead of multiplication, and only one operator in the formula is incorrect, so it belongs to operator_error."
