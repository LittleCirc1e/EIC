        "explanation": "In this example, the division step for calculating the time (step 2) is where the calculation error has been intentionally introduced. Instead of using the correct speed of 10 m/s, the calculation mistakenly uses 2 m/s. As a result, the time to pass the telegraph post is incorrectly calculated as 30 m / 2 m/s = 15 s instead of the correct 30 m / 10 m/s = 3 s. The previous step related to the speed conversion remains unaffected as it is not related to the miscalculation in the final answer. Here, the changed step 1 that leads to the miscalculation in step 2 is consistent in keeping the explanation relevant to the type of error, which is a calculation error, and only one error is considered for the transformation process.",
