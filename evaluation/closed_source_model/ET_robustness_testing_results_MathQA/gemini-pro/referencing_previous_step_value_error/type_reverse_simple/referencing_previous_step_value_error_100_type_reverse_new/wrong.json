        "question": "3 consecutive even numbers are such that thrice the first number exceeds double the third number by 7 . what is the third number ?",
        "original_solution": "Let the three consecutive even numbers be x, x+2, and x+4\n3x = 2(x+4) + 7\n3x = 2x + 8 + 7\n3x = 2x + 15\nx = 15\nThe third number is x + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19\n#### 19",
        "original_answer": 19.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let the three consecutive even numbers be x, x+2, and x+4\n3x = 2(x+4) + 7\n3x = 2x + 8 + 7\n3x = 2x + 13\nx = 13\nThe third number is x + 4 = 13 + 4 = 17\n#### 17",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references the number 15 as 13 and incorrectly changes 3x = 2x + 8 + 7 to 3x = 2x + 13. It should be noted that step 3 in the transformed_solution <3x = 2x + 8 + 7> should be the same as step 3 in the original_solution <3x = 2x + 8 + 7> and calculates its result correctly. Step 4 affects the subsequent steps 5 and 6 related to it. Step 5 incorrectly determines x as 13 (instead of the correct 15), and step 6 incorrectly calculates the third number as 17 (instead of the correct 19). The remaining calculations for steps 5 and 6 are correct based on the erroneous value obtained in step 4. Since only one error needs to be considered, all other steps that reference this result number still reference this number correctly.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_type": "none",
        "type_explanation": "The solution is correct because it correctly sets up the equation, solves for x, and then finds the third number."
