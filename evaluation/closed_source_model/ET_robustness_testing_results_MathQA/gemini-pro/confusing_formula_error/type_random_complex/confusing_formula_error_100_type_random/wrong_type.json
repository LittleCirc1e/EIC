The original solution correctly uses the area formula which includes trigonometric functions. The transformed solution incorrectly attempts to find a 'perimeter' by naively adding the two given sides with an assumed third side, which is improperly taken as half of one of the sides assuming a right triangle, which is not given in the problem. This confuses the concept of area with perimeter and also brings in an unrelated concept of a right triangle within an obtuse triangle. Note that the language description of step 1 < First, use the formula to find the area > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. The error affects the conclusion of the problem, changing the original answer from an area to a 'perimeter' measurement, despite perimeter not being relevant to the original question.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_type": "missing_step",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 4. Step 4 does not calculate the area of the triangle, but the perimeter of the triangle, which is the sum of the lengths of all three sides of the triangle. The area of a triangle is calculated using the formula A = (1/2) * b * h, where b is the length of the base of the triangle and h is the height of the triangle. Therefore, step 4 is missing the step of calculating the height of the triangle, which is necessary to calculate the area of the triangle. This error belongs to missing_step. The final answer is incorrect because step 4 uses the wrong formula to calculate the area of the triangle."
