The original_solution correctly states this as 6 * (16 cm * 16 cm). However, in the transformed_solution, the formula has been incorrectly changed to use the sum of the lengths of the edges squared, represented as (6 * (16 cm + 16 cm + 16 cm)^2), which results in an incorrect surface area calculation. The language description of 'The surface area of a cube is' remains unchanged, and the other calculation steps are still correctly portraying their respective formulas.",

        "original_solution": "Let the width be x meters\nThen the length is x+10 meters\nThe area of the field is given by length * width = (x+10)*x = 144\nExpanding the equation, we get x^2 + 10x - 144 = 0\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get x = (-10 + sqrt(10^2 - 4*1*(-144)))/2*1 = (-10 + 26)/2 = 16/2 = 8\nSo the width is 8 meters\nAnd the length is 8+10=18 meters\n#### 18",

However, the transformed solution replaces the formula for area with the formula for perimeter, resulting in an incorrect expansion of 2*((x+10) + x) = 144 instead of (x+10)*x = 144. This affects the subsequent related steps, changing the quadratics and their resolution to a linear equation and its resolution. Note that the language description of step 3 < The area of the field is given by > remains unchanged in the transformed_solution as < The perimeter of the field is given by >, causing the mistake by changing the formula used without modifying the descriptive text. It should be also noted that the only error occurs in step 3, and the initial steps and definitions remain correct.",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the volume and surface area of a cube. The question requires that the volume of the cube to be solved be equal to the side length cubed, not 3 times the square of the side length, which is a dimensionally incorrect representation of surface area (and not even the correct formula for surface area). This error results in the original equation x^3=64 being replaced by 3*x*x=64, thus solving for x gives an incorrect value, approximately 4.62 instead of the correct 4. The subsequent steps apply the incorrect side length to determine the new cube's measurements and volume. Therefore, step 2 from  x^3=64 has been modified to 3*x*x=64 in the transformed_solution, and this single incorrect application of a formula results in a subsequently incorrect computed volume of 787.305 cubic feet instead of the correct 512 cubic feet. The language description in step 2, <The original volume of the cube is> remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. All other operations and calculations remain correct, adhering to the instruction to only modify one step.",
