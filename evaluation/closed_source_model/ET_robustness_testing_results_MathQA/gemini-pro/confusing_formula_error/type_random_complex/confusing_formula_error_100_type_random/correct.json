        "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the area and circumference of a circle. The question requires that the radius of the circle to be solved be equal to the square root of the area divided by π, rather than being equal to the circumference divided by 2π, resulting in √(A/π) in the original_solution becoming 30/(2π) in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 3, changing the calculation from V = (1/3)π(30/π)(6) to V = (1/3)π(30/(2π))^2(6). Note that the language description of step 2 < To find the radius > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that only step 2 mistakenly uses the formula for the circumference of a circle, while the other steps correctly apply the formulas. The language description of the steps should remain unchanged except for the modification of the formula itself.",

        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 confuses the formula for the circumference of a circle and the formula for the radius of a circle, and it should calculate the radius of the base of the cone instead of the circumference of the base of the cone. That means, it should calculate 30 / (2 * pi) instead of 30 / (2 * pi * pi). Because it confuses the formula for the circumference of a circle and the formula for the radius of a circle, resulting in errors in both the operands and operators of the formula, it belongs to confusing_formula_error. Step 3, as the subsequent step of step 2, references the wrong result of step 2, resulting in the incorrect final answer."

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the area formula of a triangle with a sum operation. Instead of calculating the area using the correct formula (1/2) * base * height, the transformed_solution inaccurately uses a simple addition of base and height, which is not a formula for any geometrical measurement, resulting in the wrong calculation of 4 + 5 = 9 square meters. This is the first step in the transformed_solution, and no subsequent steps are present to be affected. This approach reflects a single error in the solution process where the description remains unchanged—the formula for calculating the area, however, is incorrectly transformed while the arithmetic operation based on the wrong formula is performed correctly.",
