        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the formula for surface area and volume of a cuboid. The question asks for the surface area, requiring the use of the formula 2*(l*w + w*h + h*l), but the transformed solution incorrectly uses the volume formula (l*w*h). The language description of step 1 < The surface area of the cuboid is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. However, the calculation changes to reflect volume instead, which affects the answer in the transformed_solution. In this example, only step 1 mistakes the formula for the cuboid surface area, while the other steps, including the language used and calculations, correctly calculate volume based on the revised step 1.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 1. Step 1 confuses the volume and surface area formulas of cuboid. The volume of a cuboid is equal to the length multiplied by width multiplied by height, while the surface area of a cuboid is equal to 2 * (length * width + width * height + height * length). Therefore, it should calculate 2 * (2b * b + b * b + b * 2b) instead of 2b^3. Because it confuses the volume and surface area formulas of cuboid, resulting in errors in both the operands and operators of the formula, it belongs to confusing_formula_error."
