The question requires that the volume of the hemisphere to be solved be equal to (2/3) * pi * r^3, rather than 4 * pi * r^2, which is equivalent to the surface area of a sphere, resulting in V = (2/3) * pi * r^3 in the original_solution becoming V = 4 * pi * r^2 in the transformed_solution. This leads to subsequent step 5 calculating the number of hemispheres required still using the original volume of 4 l for each hemisphere, although the calculated volume of a hemisphere has changed in step 4. As a result, the final answer changes, and the language descriptions remain unchanged.
