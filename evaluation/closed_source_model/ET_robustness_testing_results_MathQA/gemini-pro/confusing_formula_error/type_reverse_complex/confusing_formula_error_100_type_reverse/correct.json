The question calculates volume using the formula L*W*D for a normal block and then applies the same approach for a large block with modified dimensions (2W and 2D). However, in the transformed_solution, instead of using the volume formula L*(2W)*(2D), it mistakenly calculates what appears to be the surface area using an incorrect formula 2*(L*W + W*D + D*L).
