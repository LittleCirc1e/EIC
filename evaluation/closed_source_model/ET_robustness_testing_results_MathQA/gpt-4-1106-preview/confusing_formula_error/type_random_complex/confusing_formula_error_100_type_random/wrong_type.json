The language description of step 2 < Then, the surface area of the cube is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution.

The question requires that the area of the triangle to be solved be equal to the base multiplied by height divided by 2, rather than the sum of the sides of the triangle, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the triangle, resulting in (3 * 4) / 2 = 6 square units in the original_solution becoming (3 + 4 + 5) = 12 units in the transformed_solution. This does not affect any previous steps because they all correctly calculate the height using the Pythagorean theorem. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 4 mistakenly replaces the formula for triangle area with the formula for triangle perimeter, while the other calculation processes are still correct.",

The question requires that the percent composition be calculated using the total volume of the solution (540 gallons of sodium chloride plus the remaining water).
