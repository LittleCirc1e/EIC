        "explanation": "The confusion here is between the formula for the area of a triangle with two sides and an included angle and the perimeter formula of a triangle. The original solution correctly uses the area formula which includes trigonometric functions. The transformed solution incorrectly attempts to find a 'perimeter' by naively adding the two given sides with an assumed third side, which is improperly taken as half of one of the sides assuming a right triangle, which is not given in the problem. This confuses the concept of area with perimeter and also brings in an unrelated concept of a right triangle within an obtuse triangle. Note that the language description of step 1 < First, use the formula to find the area > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. The error affects the conclusion of the problem, changing the original answer from an area to a 'perimeter' measurement, despite perimeter not being relevant to the original question.",

The question requires that the volume of the cube to be solved be equal to the side length cubed, not 3 times the square of the side length, which is a dimensionally incorrect representation of surface area (and not even the correct formula for surface area). This error results in the original equation x^3=64 being replaced by 3*x*x=64, thus solving for x gives an incorrect value, approximately 4.62 instead of the correct 4. The subsequent steps apply the incorrect side length to determine the new cube's measurements and volume. Therefore, step 2 from  x^3=64 has been modified to 3*x*x=64 in the transformed_solution, and this single incorrect application of a formula results in a subsequently incorrect computed volume of 787.305 cubic feet instead of the correct 512 cubic feet.
