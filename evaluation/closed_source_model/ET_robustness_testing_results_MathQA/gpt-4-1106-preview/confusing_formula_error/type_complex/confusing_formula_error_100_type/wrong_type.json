The error results in s^2=289 in the original_solution being incorrectly changed to s=289 in the transformed_solution, following which the volume calculation becomes incorrect because it's based on the faulty dimension s.

The language description of step 2 < Then, the surface area of the cube is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution.
