        "explanation": "The transformation removes the first step which includes the formula for the area. The original step 2 references the result of step 1, which is the area formula. Without that step, the problem incorrectly applies the diagonal lengths directly without multiplying by (1/2) to find the area. The transformed_solution reflects direct multiplication without the division by 2 step, which indicates a miscalculation of the area. The first and only step in the transformed_solution also represents the first step that references an incorrect application of the formula, therefore the wrong_step is 1.",

        "pred_wrong_type": "none",
        "type_explanation": "The area of a rhombus is calculated by multiplying the lengths of its diagonals and dividing by 2. The solution correctly multiplies the diagonals (14 cm and 20 cm) but does not show the division by 2, which is implied in the final answer. Since the final answer is correct, it suggests that the division by 2 was accounted for but not explicitly shown in the solution steps."

        "original_answer": 3.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let the number be x.\nThen x^2 = (6+3)^2 = 36+54+9= 6(15) + 9, which means when the square of the number is divided by 6, the remainder is 9.\n#### 9",

The original solution uses x = 6a + 3 to form the base equation of the number before squaring it. By deleting this, the transformed solution directly references the remainder '3' when creating the square of the number, which should result in a form of (6 + 3)^2, but incorrectly transforms it into 36+54+9, implying the number to be squared was 9 instead of 6a+3. Consequently, the final step alters the remainder incorrectly from 3 to 9 when the number is squared.

        "type_explanation": "The solution correctly applies the properties of remainders. When a number x, which gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 6, is squared, the expression becomes (6k+3)^2, which simplifies to 36k^2 + 36k + 9. This can be further broken down to 6(6k^2 + 6k + 1) + 9, showing that when x^2 is divided by 6, the remainder is indeed 9. The solution correctly calculates this without any errors."

However, instead of simplifying this fraction to 2/25, an intentional error is introduced in the simplification process that results in an incorrect fraction of 4/50. Since the transformation starts from the middle of the original solution (skipping the explanation about dividing by 100), the wrong_step is 1.

It goes directly to the cross-multiplication step, which is typically derived from understanding the properties of the proportion. By skipping the proportion setup phase, the subsequent calculation uses direct cross-multiplication without stating the reason, jumping into the arithmetic part: 0.75*8 = 5*x. As the deleted step does not produce a numerical result for reference, and it's an intermediate step where the following step correctly references the numbers from the question, we use those numbers (0.75 and 8, choosing the larger one, which is 8) directly for the cross-multiplication. However, while the arithmetic operation in the transformed step 1 is correct, the ensuing calculation in step 2 incorrectly divides by 5 when it should correctly divide by 5 as in the original solution (and originally explained in the deleted step) but does not. As a consequence of this error, the derived answer of 1.5 in the transformed answer is distinct from the correct original answer of 1.2. It is step 2 in the transformed_solution, which is step 4 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing the incorrect number in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 2.",
