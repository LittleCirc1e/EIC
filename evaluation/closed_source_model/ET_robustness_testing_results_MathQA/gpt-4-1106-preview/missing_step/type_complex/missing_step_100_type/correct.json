It should be noted that the calculation of the new step after the transformation is still correct. It is changed to step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 3 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing the incorrect number in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 1.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_type": "missing_step",
        "type_explanation": "The first and only step in the solution fails to account for the change in distance from 600 km to 800 km. The solution only scales the diesel requirement based on the change in engine capacity, missing the step to scale the diesel requirement based on the change in distance as well. This missing step is necessary for the correct calculation, and its absence leads to the wrong final result."
