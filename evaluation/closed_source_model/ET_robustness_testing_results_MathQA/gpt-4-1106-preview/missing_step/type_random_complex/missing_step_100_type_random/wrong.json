Instead, step 1 directly calculates the modulo operation (which is the remainder of 853845 divided by 9). However, an intentional calculation error is introduced in step 2 where the result should remain as 6 which is the actual remainder of 853845 divided by 9, but it is inaccurately changed to 5. The wrong_step is 2 since that's where the incorrect number is first introduced in the transformed_solution.

Hence, the transformed_solution proceeds directly with converting 8% to a fraction as 8/100. However, instead of simplifying this fraction to 2/25, an intentional error is introduced in the simplification process that results in an incorrect fraction of 4/50. Since the transformation starts from the middle of the original solution (skipping the explanation about dividing by 100), the wrong_step is 1. Note that the fraction 4/50 is equivalent to 2/25, so to ensure the transformed_answer is different, we will choose 4/50.",

Hence, the total count of integer values changes from 50 to 49.
