        "explanation": "This example turns the addition in step 1 into subtraction, and by changing + to -, 0.5 - 0.5x + 0.2x = 0.4 becomes 0.5 - 0.5x - 0.2x = 0.4. This affects the subsequent related step 2. Step 2 now becomes incorrect because the term 0.2x should have been subtracted from -0.5x, but instead, it was mistakenly left as addition in the transformed solution. Therefore, the new equation after the incorrect transformation should have been 0.5 - 0.7x = 0.4, leading to -0.7x = -0.1 and x = -0.1/-0.7, which is approximately 0.14286. Hence, the explanation should reflect that an addition was incorrectly transformed into a subtraction in step 1, but the transformed solution did not correctly calculate the resultant change.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_type": "none",
        "type_explanation": "The solution correctly sets up an equation to represent the mixture of paints and solves for the fraction of the original paint that was replaced to achieve the desired intensity. The calculation is correct and leads to the correct final answer."
