        "explanation": "In this example, the multiplication operator in step 1 has been changed to division, thus incorrectly calculating the number of girls as 160 / 1/2 = 320 instead of 160 x 1/2 = 80. This results in an impossible count of boys, calculated in step 2 as 160 - 320 = -160, which is not a feasible number of students. The original count was 80 boys, so the transformation caused by the operator error in step 1 led to a nonsensical answer. Every step's calculation is correct except for the incorrect application of the operator in step 1.",

        "type_explanation": "The error is in the operator used to calculate the number of girls. Instead of dividing by 1/2, which would incorrectly double the number of students, the correct operation is to multiply 160 by 1/2 to find the number of girls."
