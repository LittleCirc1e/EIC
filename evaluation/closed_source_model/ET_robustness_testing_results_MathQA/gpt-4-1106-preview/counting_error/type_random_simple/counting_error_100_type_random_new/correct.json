        "original_solution": "In a month of 30 days, there will be 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays\nThe second Saturday and every Sunday are holidays, so there will be 2 Saturdays and 4 Sundays off\nTherefore, the total number of working days will be 30 - 2(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 24 days\n#### 24",

        "transformed_solution": "In a month of 30 days, there will be 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays\nThe second Saturday and every Sunday are holidays, so there will be 3 Saturdays and 4 Sundays off\nTherefore, the total number of working days will be 30 - 3(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 23 days\n#### 23",

The wrong step caused an overcounting error in the number of holidays (Saturdays off), and it further impacts the calculation in step 3, changing it from 30 - 2(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 24 to 30 - 3(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 23. This is the step where the counting error is made, and the other steps remain correctly calculated based on the progression of the transformed_solution, leading to a transformed_answer of 23 days which differs from the original_answer.",

The division by the number of days (which was 5 in reality but mistakenly counted as 4) is not relevant for the calculation of the percentage of books not sold.
