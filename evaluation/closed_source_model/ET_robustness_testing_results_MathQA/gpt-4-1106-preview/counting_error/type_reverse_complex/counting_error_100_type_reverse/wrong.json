        "question": "Gary’s gas station serves an average of 13 cars per hour on Saturdays, 10 cars per hour on Sundays, and 9 cars per hour on all other days of the week. If the station is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, how many cars does Gary’s station serve over the course of a typical week?",
        "original_solution": "The station is open for 16 hours on Saturday and Sunday, and 16 * 5 = 80 hours on all other days\nOn Saturday, the station serves 13 * 16 = 208 cars\nOn Sunday, the station serves 10 * 16 = 160 cars\nOn all other days, the station serves 9 * 80 = 720 cars\nThe total number of cars served in a typical week is 208 + 160 + 720 = 1088 cars\n#### 1088",
        "original_answer": 1088,
        "transformed_solution": "The station is open for 16 hours on Saturday and 16 hours on Sunday, and 16 * 6 = 96 hours on all other days\nOn Saturday, the station serves 13 * 16 = 208 cars\nOn Sunday, the station serves 10 * 16 = 160 cars\nOn all other days, the station serves 9 * 96 = 864 cars\nThe total number of cars served in a typical week is 208 + 160 + 864 = 1232 cars\n#### 1232",

        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 mistakenly counts the number of hours the station is open from Monday to Friday as 16 * 6 = 96 hours instead of 16 * 5 = 80 hours. This counting error also affects step 3, changing the calculation from 9 * 80 = 720 cars to 9 * 96 = 864 cars, and affects step 4, changing the total from 1088 cars to 1232 cars. The other calculation processes are still correct.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_type": "none",
        "type_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the number of hours the station is open each day, multiplies it by the average number of cars served per hour for each day, and then sums up the total for the week."

        "question": "John had a stock of 1400 books in his bookshop. He sold 75 on Monday, 50 on Tuesday, 64 on Wednesday, 78 on Thursday, and 135 on Friday. What percentage of the books were not sold?",
        "original_solution": "Total books sold from Monday to Friday is 75 + 50 + 64 + 78 + 135 = 402 books\nThe remaining books after these sales is 1400 - 402 = 998 books\nThe percentage of the books not sold is (998 / 1400) * 100 = 71.2857%\nThe percentage of the books not sold is approximately 71.29%\n#### 71.29",
        "original_answer": 71.29,
        "transformed_solution": "Total books sold from Monday to Friday is 75 + 50 + 64 + 78 + 135 = 402 books\nThe remaining books after these sales is 1400 - 402 = 998 books\nThe percentage of the books not sold is (998 / 1400) * 100 = 71.2857%\nThe percentage of the books not sold is approximately 71%\n#### 71",

        "wrong_step": 4,
        "wrong_type": "rounding_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, the final step inaccurately rounds the percentage from 71.2857% to 71% instead of the correct 71.29% as per the original solution. This causes the transformed answer to be different from the original answer, creating a rounding error at step 4. It's important to note that the counting in earlier steps is unchanged, with only the final rounding step being affected.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_type": "none",
        "type_explanation": "The solution correctly follows the steps to calculate the total books sold, the remaining books, and the percentage of books not sold without any errors in the process."
