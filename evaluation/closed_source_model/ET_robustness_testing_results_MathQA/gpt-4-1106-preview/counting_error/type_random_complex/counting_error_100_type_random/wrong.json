        "question": "John had a stock of 1400 books in his bookshop. He sold 75 on Monday, 50 on Tuesday, 64 on Wednesday, 78 on Thursday, and 135 on Friday. What percentage of the books were not sold?",
        "original_solution": "Total books sold from Monday to Friday is 75 + 50 + 64 + 78 + 135 = 402 books\nThe remaining books after these sales is 1400 - 402 = 998 books\nThe percentage of the books not sold is (998 / 1400) * 100 = 71.2857%\nThe percentage of the books not sold is approximately 71.29%\n#### 71.29",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, the final step inaccurately rounds the percentage from 71.2857% to 71% instead of the correct 71.29% as per the original solution. This causes the transformed answer to be different from the original answer, creating a rounding error at step 4. It's important to note that the counting in earlier steps is unchanged, with only the final rounding step being affected.",

        "type_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the total books sold, the remaining books, and the percentage of books not sold, following the correct mathematical procedures and rounding to the nearest whole number."

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 erroneously counts the number of Sundays in a month as 4 instead of 5. The transformation affects step 1 where the calculation should be 510 * 5 = 2550 but was modified to 510 * 4 = 2040. Consequently, step 2 changes the number of days in the month that are not Sunday from 25 to 26, resulting in a change from 240 * 25 = 6000 to 240 * 26 = 6240. Step 3 and 4 are adjusted accordingly to result in a different average. The previous and unrelated steps are not affected.",

        "type_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the total number of visitors on Sundays and other days, adds them to find the total number of visitors in the month, and then divides by the number of days in the month to find the average number of visitors per day."
