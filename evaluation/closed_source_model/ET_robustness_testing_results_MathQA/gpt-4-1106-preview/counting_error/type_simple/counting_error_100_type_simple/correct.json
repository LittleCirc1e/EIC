        "original_solution": "On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday she works 8 hours/day, so in total 8 * 3 = 24 hours\nOn Tuesday and Thursday she works 6 hours/day, so in total 6 * 2 = 12 hours\nThe total hours she works in a week is 24 + 12 = 36 hours\nTo find her hourly wage, we divide her weekly earnings by the total hours worked, 504 / 36 = 14\n#### 14",

        "explanation": "The mistake happens in step 1 where it counts Monday, Wednesday, and Friday as 2 days instead of 3 days, resulting in 8 * 3 = 24 hours becoming 8 * 2 = 16 hours. The subsequent step 3 and 4 that rely on the total hours are affected: step 3 changes from 24 + 12 = 36 hours to 16 + 12 = 28 hours, and step 4 changes from 504 / 36 = 14 to 504 / 28 = 18.
