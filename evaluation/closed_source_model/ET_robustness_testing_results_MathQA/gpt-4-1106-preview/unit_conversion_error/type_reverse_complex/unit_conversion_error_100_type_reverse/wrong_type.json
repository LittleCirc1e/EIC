And it affects the subsequent related step 4, which changes from 7x + 210 = 5x - 1050 to 7x + 210 = 5x - 700. Step 5 changes from 2x = -1260, so x = -630 to 2x = -910, so x = -455. The final correct distance remains positive; thus, the child is 455 meters from his school in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",
