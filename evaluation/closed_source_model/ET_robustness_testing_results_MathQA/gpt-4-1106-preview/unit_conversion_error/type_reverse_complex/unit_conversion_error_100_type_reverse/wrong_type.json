        "explanation": "Here, step 3 makes an incorrect unit conversion, which means the half an hour earlier arrival time is wrongly calculated as 20 minutes earlier (half an hour should be 30 minutes), resulting in x/7 - 30 in the original_solution becoming x/7 - 20 in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 4, which changes from 7x + 210 = 5x - 1050 to 7x + 210 = 5x - 700. Step 5 changes from 2x = -1260, so x = -630 to 2x = -910, so x = -455. The final correct distance remains positive; thus, the child is 455 meters from his school in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",
