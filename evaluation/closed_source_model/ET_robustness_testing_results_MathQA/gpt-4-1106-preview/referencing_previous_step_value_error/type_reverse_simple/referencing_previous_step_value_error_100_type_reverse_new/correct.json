        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references 25 as 20 from step 3 and changes 4 * 25 = 100 cm to 4 * 20 = 80 cm. It should be noted that step 3 in the transformed_solution <The side length of the square is √625 = 25 cm.> should be the same as step 3 in the original_solution <The side length of the square is √625 = 25 cm.> and calculates its result 25 correctly. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all steps is still correct.",
