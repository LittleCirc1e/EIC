The error occurs again in the subtraction step (4/5 * x - 5/5 * x = 12), resulting in an arithmetic error that leads to a negative time, which doesn't make sense in the real-world context. As this is the root error, only this step is considered incorrect, and the following steps correctly apply the erroneous result from this step: Step 4 correctly subtracts -5/5 * x from 4/5 * x, giving -1/5 * x = 12, and Step 5 correctly solves for x, getting x = -60. However, the answer makes no sense as time cannot be negative, showing the influence of the initial error in Step 2.",
