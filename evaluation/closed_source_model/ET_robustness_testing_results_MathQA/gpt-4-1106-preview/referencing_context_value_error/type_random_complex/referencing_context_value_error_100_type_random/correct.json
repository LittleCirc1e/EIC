Its subsequent related steps will be affected, calculating 225 - 35 = 190 instead of 225 - 30 = 195 in step 2, calculating 190 / 0.25 = 760 instead of 195 / 0.25 = 780 in the final step. Please note that you should only consider one error, so the subsequent related steps of this erroneous step will only inherit its erroneous result and be calculated correctly.",
