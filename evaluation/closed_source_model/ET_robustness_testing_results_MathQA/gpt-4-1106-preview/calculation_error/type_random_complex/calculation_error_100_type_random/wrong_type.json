        "original_answer": 5.0,

        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "To transform the solution, we change the number of positive integers less than 50 that are multiples of 9 from 5 to 6 in step 2. This is a calculation error that does not affect the previous step, which correctly lists the multiples of 9. Since the subsequent step only includes concluding the count, it inherits this modified number, but the calculation to obtain that number is not shown and hence not affected in the steps provided. The previous steps of listing the multiples are correct and remain unchanged. The transformed answer differs from the original answer as a result of the mistaken count.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "type_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 incorrectly counts the number of positive integers less than 50 that are multiples of 9, stating there are 6 when there are actually 5. This error only involves an incorrect count of items, so it belongs to counting_error."
