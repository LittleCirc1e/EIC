        "any_explanation": "The solution is incorrect. The error is in the step where 36 is divided by 0.5. The correct way to divide 36 by 50% is to multiply 36 by 2, which is the reciprocal of 0.5. The correct solution should be: 3/5N = 36 / 0.5 3/5N = 36 * 2 3/5N = 72 N = 72 / (3/5) N = 72 / 0.6 N = 120 Therefore, the number is 120."

They first find the number of revolutions each gear makes in one minute, then find the difference in the number of revolutions made by the two gears in one minute. They then divide this difference by the number of revolutions gear l makes in one minute to find the number of minutes it takes for gear r to make 6 more revolutions than gear l. Finally, they convert this time to seconds."
