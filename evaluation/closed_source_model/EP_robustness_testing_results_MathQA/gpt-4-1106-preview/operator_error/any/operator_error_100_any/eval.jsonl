What is the maximum distance someone could travel with $4.90?", "transformed_solution": "Each additional quarter of a mile costs $0.15, so (4.90 - 1.85) / 0.15 = 20.33\nThe maximum distance someone could travel is 20 * 0.25 = 5 miles\n#### 5", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "no", "any_explanation": "The calculation of the number of additional quarters of a mile is incorrect because it does not take into account that the result should be a whole number since you cannot travel a fraction of a quarter mile for a set fare. The correct calculation should round down the number of additional quarters to the nearest whole number."}
{"question": "circular gears l and r start to rotate at the same time at the same rate . gear l makes 20 complete revolutions per minute and gear r makes 40 revolutions per minute . how many seconds after the gears start to rotate will gear r have made exactly 6 more revolutions than gear l ?", "transformed_solution": "In one minute, gear l makes 20*60 = 1200 revolutions\nIn one minute, gear r makes 40*60 = 2400 revolutions\nIn one minute, gear r makes 2400-1200 = 1200 more revolutions than gear l\nIn one minute, gear r makes 1200/20 = 60 more revolutions than gear l\nGear r will make exactly 6 more revolutions than gear l in 60/10 = 6 seconds\n#### 6", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "no", "any_explanation": "The calculation of revolutions per minute is incorrect. Gear l makes 20 revolutions per minute, not 1200, and gear r makes 40 revolutions per minute, not 2400. The correct approach is to find the difference in revolutions per minute between the two gears and then calculate the time it takes for gear r to make 6 more revolutions than gear l."}
{"question": "If 853845 bars of chocolate need to be placed in little boxes and each box can contain at most 9 bars of chocolate, how many bars of chocolate will be in the last unfilled box?", "transformed_solution": "The number of bars of chocolate in the last unfilled box is the remainder after dividing 853845 by 9.\nSo, the number of bars of chocolate in the last unfilled box is 6.\n#### 6", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "no", "any_explanation": "The solution provided does not show the actual calculation or the correct remainder when 853845 is divided by 9."}
{"question": "if xy = 25 , x / y = 36 , for positive numbers x and y , y = ?", "transformed_solution": "x = 25 / y\n25 / y / y = 36\ny^2 = 25 / 36\ny = sqrt(25 / 36)\ny = 5 / 6\n#### 5 / 6", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "no", "any_explanation": "The solution incorrectly simplifies the equation. The correct steps should be: x = 25/y, then x/y = (25/y)/y = 25/y^2 = 36. This leads to y^2 = 25/36, and taking the square root of both sides should give y = sqrt(25)/sqrt(36), which simplifies to y = 5/6. However, the solution incorrectly simplifies 25/y/y to 25/y^2 instead of 25/y^2 = 36."}
{"question": "if x is an integer such that 1 < x < 9 , 2 < x < 15 , 7 > x > \u2013 1 , 4 > x > 0 , and x + 1 < 5 , then x is", "transformed_solution": "The overlapping intervals are:\n2 < x < 5\nTherefore the possible values of x are 3 and 4\n#### 3, 4", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "no", "any_explanation": "The solution correctly identifies the overlapping interval as 2 < x < 5, but fails to consider that x must be an integer. The condition x + 1 < 5 implies that x < 4. Therefore, the only integer value that x can take that satisfies all the given conditions is 3."}
