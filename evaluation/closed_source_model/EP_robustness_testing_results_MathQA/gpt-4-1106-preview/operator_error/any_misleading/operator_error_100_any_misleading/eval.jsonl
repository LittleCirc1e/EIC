{"question": "How to resolve this question: 2, 5, 10, 17, ...?", "transformed_solution": "The series is increasing by 3, 5, 7, ... \nTo get the next number in the sequence, add 2 to the previous difference, 7. \n17 + 9 = 26 \n#### 26", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "yes", "any_explanation": "The student correctly identified the pattern of increasing differences (3, 5, 7) and correctly added 9 to the last number in the sequence to find the next number."}
{"question": "jar x is 1 / 3 full of water . jar y , which has half the capacity of jar x , is 1 / 2 full of water . if the water in jar y is poured into jar x , then jar x will be filled to what fraction of its capacity ?", "transformed_solution": "Jar y is 1/2 full, so it is 1/2 * (1/2) = 1/4 full of the capacity of jar x.\nAfter pouring the water from jar y into jar x, jar x will be 1/3 + 1/4 = 7/12 full of its capacity.\n#### 7/12", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "yes", "any_explanation": "The student correctly calculated that jar y, which is half the capacity of jar x, is effectively 1/4 of jar x's capacity when it is 1/2 full. Adding this to the 1/3 of jar x that is already full gives 1/3 + 1/4, which is correctly calculated as 7/12. Therefore, the final answer of 7/12 is correct."}
{"question": "the speed of a car is 90 km in the first hour and 30 km in the second hour . what is the average speed of the car ?", "transformed_solution": "The total distance traveled is 90 + 30 = 120 km\nThe total time taken is 1 + 1 = 2 hours\nThe average speed is 120 / 2 = 60 km/h\n#### 60", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "yes", "any_explanation": "The student correctly added the distances for the two hours to find the total distance and correctly added the time to find the total time. Then, they correctly divided the total distance by the total time to find the average speed."}
{"question": "Maxwell leaves his home and walks toward Brad's house at the same time that Brad leaves his home and runs toward Maxwell's house. If the distance between their homes is 36 kilometers, Maxwell's walking speed is 3 km/h, and Brad's running speed is 6 km/h. What is the distance traveled by Maxwell when they meet in the middle?", "transformed_solution": "Let the time they meet be t hours.\nBrad's distance = 6t\nMaxwell's distance = 3t\nTotal distance = 36\n6t + 3t = 36\n9t = 36\nt = 4\nMaxwell's distance = 3 x 4 = 12\n#### 12", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "yes", "any_explanation": "The student correctly set up the equations to find the time when Maxwell and Brad meet and then used that time to calculate the distance Maxwell traveled.

{"question": "if 50 % of 3 / 5 of a number is 36 , then the number is ?", "transformed_solution": "3/5N = 36 / (50%) \n3/5N = 36 / 0.5 \n3/5N = 72 \nN = 72 / (3/5) \nN = 72 / 0.6 \nN = 120 \n#### 120", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "yes", "any_explanation": "The student correctly converted 50% to 0.5, then divided 36 by 0.5 to find the value of 3/5 of the number. After that, they correctly solved for N by dividing 72 by 3/5, which is the same as multiplying by 5/3, resulting in the correct answer of 120."}
{"question": "A taxi company charges $1.85 for the first quarter of a mile and fifteen cents for each additional quarter of a mile. What is the maximum distance someone could travel with $4.90?", "transformed_solution": "Each additional quarter of a mile costs $0.15, so (4.90 - 1.85) / 0.15 = 20.33\nThe maximum distance someone could travel is 20 * 0.25 = 5 miles\n#### 5", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "no", "any_explanation": "The calculation of the number of additional quarters of a mile is incorrect. After subtracting the initial charge of $1.85 from the total amount of $4.90, the remaining amount is $3.05. Dividing this by the cost per additional quarter mile, $0.15, gives 20.33, which should be rounded down to 20 because you cannot travel a fraction of a quarter mile for a fixed rate. Therefore, the total distance includes the first quarter mile plus 20 additional quarters, or 20.25 miles in total, not 5 miles."}
{"question": "circular gears l and r start to rotate at the same time at the same rate . gear l makes 20 complete revolutions per minute and gear r makes 40 revolutions per minute . how many seconds after the gears start to rotate will gear r have made exactly 6 more revolutions than gear l ?", "transformed_solution": "In one minute, gear l makes 20*60 = 1200 revolutions\nIn one minute, gear r makes 40*60 = 2400 revolutions\nIn one minute, gear r makes 2400-1200 = 1200 more revolutions than gear l\nIn one minute, gear r makes 1200/20 = 60 more revolutions than gear l\nGear r will make exactly 6 more revolutions than gear l in 60/10 = 6 seconds\n#### 6", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "no", "any_explanation": "The student's calculations are incorrect. Gear l makes 20 revolutions per minute, not 1200. Gear r makes 40 revolutions per minute, not 2400. The difference in revolutions per minute between gear r and gear l is 40 - 20 = 20 revolutions. To find out how many seconds it takes for gear r to make 6 more revolutions than gear l, we divide the number of extra revolutions gear r makes per minute by the number of minutes in an hour, and then multiply by 60 to convert minutes to seconds. The correct calculation is 6 revolutions / 20 revolutions per minute * 60 seconds per minute = 18 seconds."}
{"question": "If 853845 bars of chocolate need to be placed in little boxes and each box can contain at most 9 bars of chocolate, how many bars of chocolate will be in the last unfilled box?", "transformed_solution": "The number of bars of chocolate in the last unfilled box is the remainder after dividing 853845 by 9.\nSo, the number of bars of chocolate in the last unfilled box is 6.\n#### 6", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "no", "any_explanation": "The student's final answer is incorrect. The remainder of 853845 divided by 9 is not 6. The correct remainder needs to be calculated to determine the number of bars in the last unfilled box."}
