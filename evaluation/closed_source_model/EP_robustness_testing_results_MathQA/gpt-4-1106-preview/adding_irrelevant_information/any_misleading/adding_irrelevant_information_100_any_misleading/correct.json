        "transformed_solution": "Let the time they meet be t hours.\nBrad's distance = 6t\nMaxwell's distance = 3t\nTotal distance = 36\n6t + 3t = 36\n9t = 36\nt = 4\nMaxwell's distance = 3 x 4 = 12\n#### 12",

        "any_explanation": "The student correctly set up the equations to find the time when Maxwell and Brad meet by using their speeds and the total distance. After finding the time, the student correctly calculated the distance Maxwell traveled by multiplying his speed by the time."

        "transformed_solution": "Each additional quarter of a mile costs $0.15, so (4.90 - 1.85) / 0.15 = 20.33\nThe maximum distance someone could travel is 20 * 0.25 = 5 miles\n#### 5",

        "any_explanation": "The calculation (4.90 - 1.85) / 0.15 is correct and results in approximately 20.33, which means the customer can afford 20 additional quarters of a mile after the first quarter mile. However, the total distance should include the first quarter mile. Therefore, the total distance should be 20 * 0.25 + 0.25 = 5.25 miles, not 5 miles."

        "transformed_solution": "In one minute, gear l makes 20*60 = 1200 revolutions\nIn one minute, gear r makes 40*60 = 2400 revolutions\nIn one minute, gear r makes 2400-1200 = 1200 more revolutions than gear l\nIn one minute, gear r makes 1200/20 = 60 more revolutions than gear l\nGear r will make exactly 6 more revolutions than gear l in 60/10 = 6 seconds\n#### 6",

        "any_explanation": "The student's calculations are incorrect. Gear l makes 20 revolutions per minute, not 1200. Gear r makes 40 revolutions per minute, not 2400. The difference in revolutions per minute between gear r and gear l is 40 - 20 = 20 revolutions. To find out how many seconds it takes for gear r to make exactly 6 more revolutions than gear l, we divide the number of extra revolutions gear r makes in a minute by the number of extra revolutions we are looking for: 20 revolutions per minute / 6 revolutions = 3.33 minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, it takes 3.33 * 60 = 200 seconds for gear r to make 6 more revolutions than gear l."
