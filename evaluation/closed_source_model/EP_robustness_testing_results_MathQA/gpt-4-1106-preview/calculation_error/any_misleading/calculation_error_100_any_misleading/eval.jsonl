After that, they correctly solved for N by dividing 72 by 3/5, which is the same as multiplying by 5/3, resulting in the correct answer of 120."}
{"question": "A taxi company charges $1.85 for the first quarter of a mile and fifteen cents for each additional quarter of a mile. What is the maximum distance someone could travel with $4.90?", "transformed_solution": "Each additional quarter of a mile costs $0.15, so (4.90 - 1.85) / 0.15 = 20.33\nThe maximum distance someone could travel is 20 * 0.25 = 5 miles\n#### 5", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "no", "any_explanation": "The calculation of the number of additional quarters of a mile is incorrect. After subtracting the initial charge of $1.85 from the total amount of $4.90, the remaining amount is $3.05, which should be divided by $0.15 to find the number of additional quarters of a mile. The correct calculation is (4.90 - 1.85) / 0.15 = 20.3333, which should be rounded down to 20 because you cannot travel a fraction of a quarter mile for a fixed rate. However, the total distance should include the first quarter mile. Therefore, the total distance is 20 quarters of a mile plus the initial quarter of a mile, which is 21 quarters of a mile or 21 * 0.25 = 5.25 miles. The final answer should be 5.25 miles, not 5 miles."}
{"question": "circular gears l and r start to rotate at the same time at the same rate . gear l makes 20 complete revolutions per minute and gear r makes 40 revolutions per minute . how many seconds after the gears start to rotate will gear r have made exactly 6 more revolutions than gear l ?", "transformed_solution": "In one minute, gear l makes 20*60 = 1200 revolutions\nIn one minute, gear r makes 40*60 = 2400 revolutions\nIn one minute, gear r makes 2400-1200 = 1200 more revolutions than gear l\nIn one minute, gear r makes 1200/20 = 60 more revolutions than gear l\nGear r will make exactly 6 more revolutions than gear l in 60/10 = 6 seconds\n#### 6", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "no", "any_explanation": "The student's calculations are incorrect. Gear l makes 20 revolutions per minute, not 1200. Gear r makes 40 revolutions per minute, not 2400. The difference in revolutions per minute between gear r and gear l is 40 - 20 = 20 revolutions. To find out how many seconds it takes for gear r to make 6 more revolutions than gear l, we divide the number of extra revolutions gear r makes per minute by the number of revolutions we are interested in (6), and then convert minutes to seconds. The correct calculation is 6 revolutions / (40 revolutions/minute - 20 revolutions/minute) = 6 / 20 revolutions per minute = 0.3 minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, it takes 0.3 * 60 = 18 seconds for gear r to make 6 more revolutions than gear l."}
