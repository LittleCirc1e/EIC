However, the final step in the calculation is incorrect.\n\nLet's correct the calculation:\n\nFirst, we subtract the initial charge from the total amount:\n$4.90 - $1.85 = $3.05\n\nNext, we divide the remaining amount by the cost per additional quarter mile:\n$3.05 / $0.15 = 20.33\n\nSince we can't travel a fraction of a quarter mile for a fraction of the cost, we can only travel for a whole number of quarters. Therefore, we can travel 20 additional quarters of a mile.\n\nNow, we add the initial quarter mile to the 20 additional quarters:\n20 quarters + 1 initial quarter = 21 quarters\n\nFinally, we convert quarters of a mile to miles:\n21 quarters * 0.25 miles/quarter = 5.25 miles\n\nThe correct maximum distance is 5.25 miles, not 5 miles.
