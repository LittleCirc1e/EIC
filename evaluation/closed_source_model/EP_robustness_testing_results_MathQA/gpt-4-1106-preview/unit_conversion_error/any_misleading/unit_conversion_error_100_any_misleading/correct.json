The correct approach is to understand that the difference in speed with and without stoppages is due to the time lost during stoppages. Since the speed of the bus without stoppages is 60 km/hr and with stoppages is 20 km/hr, this means that for every hour, the bus travels 60 km without stoppages and only 20 km with stoppages. The distance is the same in both cases, so we can set up the equation 60*(60-x)/60 = 20, where x is the time stopped in minutes. Solving for x gives us x = 40 minutes.
