The correct total amount of water is 15/20 + 16/20 = 31/20, which is greater than 1 and not possible since the total amount in each glass cannot exceed 1. The correct calculation should ensure that the total amount of water is the remainder of the glass after the milk has been accounted for, which would be 3/4 + 4/5 = 15/20 + 16/20 = 31/20, but since each glass can only hold a total of 1 unit of liquid, the correct total for water should be 3/4 from the first glass plus 4/5 from the second glass, both of which need to be converted to a common denominator of 20: 3/4 = 15/20 and 4/5 = 16/20. However, since we cannot have more than 20/20 in each glass, we must adjust the calculation. The correct total amount of water is (3/4 + 4/5) * (20/20) = (15/20 + 16/20) * (20/20) = 31/40.
