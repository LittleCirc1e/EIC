The student also incorrectly concluded that gear r makes 1200 more revolutions than gear l, which is not the case."}
{"question": "If 853845 bars of chocolate need to be placed in little boxes and each box can contain at most 9 bars of chocolate, how many bars of chocolate will be in the last unfilled box?", "transformed_solution": "The number of bars of chocolate in the last unfilled box is the remainder after dividing 853845 by 9.\nSo, the number of bars of chocolate in the last unfilled box is 6.\n#### 6", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "no", "any_explanation": "The student's final answer is incorrect. The remainder of 853845 divided by 9 is not 6. The correct remainder must be calculated to determine the number of bars in the last unfilled box."}
{"question": "if xy = 25 , x / y = 36 , for positive numbers x and y , y = ?", "transformed_solution": "x = 25 / y\n25 / y / y = 36\ny^2 = 25 / 36\ny = sqrt(25 / 36)\ny = 5 / 6\n#### 5 / 6", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "no", "any_explanation": "The student incorrectly solved for x first instead of directly solving for y. Also, the student made a calculation error when simplifying y^2 = 25 / 36, which would give y = \u00b15/6, but since the question specifies positive numbers, only the positive root would be considered. However, the student's final answer is incorrect given the correct process would yield y = 5/6, not 5/6 as the student wrote, which implies a misunderstanding of the square root operation."}
{"question": "if x is an integer such that 1 < x < 9 , 2 < x < 15 , 7 > x > \u2013 1 , 4 > x > 0 , and x + 1 < 5 , then x is", "transformed_solution": "The overlapping intervals are:\n2 < x < 5\nTherefore the possible values of x are 3 and 4\n#### 3, 4", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "yes", "any_explanation": "The student correctly identified the overlapping intervals and constraints, and concluded that the only possible integer values for x are 3 and 4, which satisfy all the given conditions."}
