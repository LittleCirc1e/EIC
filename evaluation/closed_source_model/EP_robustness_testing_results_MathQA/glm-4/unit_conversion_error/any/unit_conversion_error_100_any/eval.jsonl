{"question": "circular gears l and r start to rotate at the same time at the same rate . gear l makes 20 complete revolutions per minute and gear r makes 40 revolutions per minute . how many seconds after the gears start to rotate will gear r have made exactly 6 more revolutions than gear l ?", "transformed_solution": "In one minute, gear l makes 20*60 = 1200 revolutions\nIn one minute, gear r makes 40*60 = 2400 revolutions\nIn one minute, gear r makes 2400-1200 = 1200 more revolutions than gear l\nIn one minute, gear r makes 1200/20 = 60 more revolutions than gear l\nGear r will make exactly 6 more revolutions than gear l in 60/10 = 6 seconds\n#### 6", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "no", "any_explanation": "The solution incorrectly calculates the number of revolutions per minute for each gear and does not correctly determine the time it takes for gear r to make 6 more revolutions than gear l."}
{"question": "If 853845 bars of chocolate need to be placed in little boxes and each box can contain at most 9 bars of chocolate, how many bars of chocolate will be in the last unfilled box?", "transformed_solution": "The number of bars of chocolate in the last unfilled box is the remainder after dividing 853845 by 9.\nSo, the number of bars of chocolate in the last unfilled box is 6.\n#### 6", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "no", "any_explanation": "The solution did not show the division process to find the remainder, and simply stated the answer without explanation. To be correct, it should have demonstrated how 853845 is divided by 9 to yield a remainder of 6."}

It should start with x = 36y instead of x = 25/y, because x/y = 36 is given."}
