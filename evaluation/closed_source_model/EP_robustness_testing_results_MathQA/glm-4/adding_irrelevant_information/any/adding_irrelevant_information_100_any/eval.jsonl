The motorist travels for 6 hours, so the first half, which is 3 hours, should be multiplied by the speed of 60 kmph, and the second half, also 3 hours, should be multiplied by the speed of 48 kmph."}
{"question": "How to resolve this question: 2, 5, 10, 17, ...?", "transformed_solution": "The series is increasing by 3, 5, 7, ... \nTo get the next number in the sequence, add 2 to the previous difference, 7. \n17 + 9 = 26 \n#### 26", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "yes", "any_explanation": "The sequence provided has a pattern of adding an odd number to each term. Starting with 3, the differences between consecutive terms are 5, 7, and the next would be 9 (as each difference increases by 2). The solution correctly identifies this pattern and applies it to find the next term, which is indeed 26."}
{"question": "jar x is 1 / 3 full of water . jar y , which has half the capacity of jar x , is 1 / 2 full of water . if the water in jar y is poured into jar x , then jar x will be filled to what fraction of its capacity ?", "transformed_solution": "Jar y is 1/2 full, so it is 1/2 * (1/2) = 1/4 full of the capacity of jar x.\nAfter pouring the water from jar y into jar x, jar x will be 1/3 + 1/4 = 7/12 full of its capacity.\n#### 7/12", "label": "yes", "is_correct": "no", "any_explanation": "The solution incorrectly calculates the fraction of Jar y's capacity relative to Jar x. Since Jar y has half the capacity of Jar x, when it is 1/2 full, it is actually 1/2 of Jar y's capacity, which is equivalent to 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 of Jar x's capacity. However, the solution incorrectly adds 1/3 and 1/4 as if they were both fractions of Jar x's capacity. The correct calculation should be 1/3 + 1/4, but expressed as a common fraction of Jar x's capacity, which is 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12. The explanation provided is incorrect in how it arrives at the 1/4 fraction."}
