Jar y has half the capacity of jar x and is 1/2 full, so it is actually 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 of jar x's capacity.

The correct calculation should be 1/3 + 1/4 = 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12, but since jar y is only 1/4 of jar x, the water it contains is equivalent to 1/4 of jar x's capacity, not 1/2."}

The time 't' at which they meet should be 36 km divided by their combined speed (3 km/h + 6 km/h = 9 km/h), which is 36 km / 9 km/h = 4 hours. However, the student has correctly identified that Maxwell's distance is half of Brad's because Maxwell is walking at half the speed. The error is in the final calculation of Maxwell's distance, which should be 3 km/h * 4 hours = 12 km, not '3 x 4 = 12'.
