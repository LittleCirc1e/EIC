On the second day, he holds it for 20 seconds. On the third day, he holds it for 30 seconds. After realizing that he can hold it for ten extra seconds each day, he realizes he can calculate how many days it is until he reaches 90 if he keeps up the same pace. So how many days until he can hold his breath for 90 seconds?",
        "original_solution": "He still has to improve by 60 more seconds because 90 - 30 = 60\nThis will take 6 days because 60 / 10 = 6\n#### 6",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The first step of the original solution has been removed. Originally, this step calculates the remaining seconds by subtracting 30 (the result of the third day) from 90. After removing this step, the 60 seconds of improvement mentioned in the result no longer has context, and the solution incorrectly assumes that Chris is starting from 0 seconds, which leads to dividing 90 by 10 to recommend 9 days of training. Since the deleted first step referenced the number 30 from the question, the transformed answer should still reflect the additional 60 seconds of improvement needed. However, the error in the transformation directly references 90 instead of the correct context, which is why the wrong_step is 1.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "The pattern is that Chris is adding 10 seconds each day. So the time he can hold his breath is given by the formula: 10 * day = time in seconds. We need to find the day when the time is at least 90 seconds.",
        "corrected_answer": 8.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "To find the day when Chris can hold his breath for 90 seconds, we solve the equation 10 * day = 90. Dividing both sides by 10, we get day = 9. However, since Chris starts counting from day 1, it will actually be the 8th day when he reaches 90 seconds."

He has decided to purchase a two-ton truck with several added features: a king cab upgrade, a towing package, leather seats, running boards, and the upgraded exterior light package. The base price of the truck is $30,000, and the other features are at extra cost. The king cab is an extra $7,500, leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1500. What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?",
        "original_solution": "The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, at a cost of $7,500/3=$2500.\nThe running boards are $500 less than the leather seats at a cost of $2500-$500=$2000\nThe total cost of the truck is $30,000+$7500+$2500+$2000+$1500=$43,500\n#### 43,500",

In the original_solution, step 1 calculates the cost of the leather seats as one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, and step 2 references the result $2500 from step 1. Therefore, after deleting step 1, step 2 should reference the calculation for the cost of the leather seats directly as one-third of the cost of the king cab upgrade and then subtracting $500. The language in the transformed_solution is updated to combine the deleted step's calculation with the next step into 'The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats which are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, at a cost of $7500/3-$500=$2000'. Step 3 is adjusted accordingly to reference the recalculated price for the running boards and provide a new total cost, changing from $30,000+$7500+$2500+$2000+$1500=$43,500 to $30,000+$7500+($7500/3)+$2000+$1500=$42,000.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so they are $2500 - $500 = $2000. The upgraded exterior light package is $1500. Adding all these to the base price of the truck gives us the total cost: $30,000 + $7,500 + $2500 + $2000 + $1500 = $45,000.",

In step 5, which previously added up Jeff's total skips, the number 15 from step 1 is replaced by 16, the number in the question, adjusting the total.

It then adds the transformed steps from the third step of the original solution. The weight of the soda, which is 1000 pounds, is not added in the transformed_solution, so the final transformed_answer is 23000 pounds, which results from omitting the weight of the soda.
