        "original_solution": "Adam had twice as many sheep as the cows, so 2 sheep/cow * 12 cows = 24 sheep.\nFor every sheep, he bought 3 pigs, so he bought 3 pigs/sheep * 24 sheep = 72 pigs.\nIn total on the farm, there were 72 pigs + 24 sheep + 12 cows = 108 animals.\n#### 108",

        "explanation": "Here, the first step has been removed. In the original_solution, step 1 calculates the number of sheep based on the number of cows, and this result is used in step 2 to calculate the number of pigs. After deleting step 1, the number of sheep is missing in the modified solution, and step 2 should change the formula from 3 pigs/sheep * 24 sheep to 3 pigs/sheep * (2 * 12 cows). However, this has been incorrectly omitted, and the calculation of pigs is directly based on the number of sheep from the removed step, resulting in an unaccounted number of sheep in step 2. The subsequent step 3, which originally summed up pigs, sheep, and cows, now incorrectly sums up just pigs and cows, leading to a wrong total count of animals on the farm. It is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 3 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step with the unaccounted number in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 1.",

It also correctly implies that Adam's total number of animals after the transaction is the sum of his original animals (12 cows and 24 sheep) plus the new pigs (72 pigs), which equals 108 animals. No correction is needed."

The original_solution's first step calculates the number of pies Eddie bakes in 7 days, and the subsequent steps calculate the sister's and mother's output, before summing them all in the final step. After deleting step 1, the final step needs to change to directly reference the number of pies Eddie can bake without calculating it separately. Originally Eddie's contribution is 3 * 7 = 21, but since we're no longer calculating this, we directly use 3*7 in the sum, hence the new formula becomes 3*7 + 42 + 56 = 119. However, an error was introduced in the transformed solution: instead of summing up the correct numbers to maintain the original answer, the total was incorrectly added as 3*7 + 42 + 56 = 133. Due to this error, the transformed answer differs from the original. The wrong_step is 3 which is the first step that has the incorrect reference in the transformed_solution.

Since the first step is missing, we need to adjust the final summation step (original Step 5) to compensate for this removal.

By removing the first day's 2 paintings and not adjusting the final sum to account for this absence, it results in an error in calculation. Specifically, the final sum should still be 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 as in the original solution. However, in the transformed step, the summation incorrectly doubles the calculated total to 124, which becomes the transformed_answer. Therefore, the wrong_step is the last remaining one (number 5 in the sequence of steps that have not been deleted), as it improperly adjusts for the missing step and incorrectly doubles the total count, showing a calculation error.",

It should be noted that while the calculation itself is algebraically correct, the premise is wrong because it does not consider the entire trip.
