        "question": "Paul lives in a 5th story apartment. He makes 3 trips out from and back to his apartment throughout the day each day of a week. How many feet does he travel vertically in total over the week if each story is 10 feet tall?",
        "original_solution": "Since Paul makes 3 trips per day, and each trip involves going both down and up, this means he travels the full vertical distance of his apartment complex 3*2=6 times a day.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, this means he makes this trip 6*7=42 times a week.\nSince each story is 10 feet tall, that means with 5 stories he travels 5*10=50 feet each trip.\nSince he made 42 trips of 50 feet each, this means he traveled 50*42=2100 feet in a week.\n#### 2100",
        "original_answer": 2100.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Since Paul makes 3 trips per day, and each trip involves going both down and up, this means he travels the full vertical distance of his apartment complex 3/2=1.5 times a day.\n",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example replaces multiplication with division in step 1, changing '3*2=6' to '3/2=1.5'. The result of this incorrect operator change is then used in step 2, changing '6*7=42' to '1.5*7=10.5'. Since step 3 correctly calculates the height of one trip, step 4 correctly multiplies the height of one trip by the incorrect number of total trips, changing '50*42=2100' to '50*10.5=525'. This change affects subsequent steps, but all the calculations after the wrong step are correctly performed based on the wrong intermediate result.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates that Paul makes 1.5 trips up and down each day, as each trip involves going down and then back up."

        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example changes the subtraction in the original solution step 1 to addition, turning '20-6 = 14 inches' into '20+6 = 26 inches'. Subsequently, step 2, which calculates the length of Kate's hair based on the length of Emily's hair, now uses the incorrect figure from step 1 but does the calculation correctly. Thus, '14/2= 7 inches' is transformed into '26/2= 13 inches'. The transformed answer is therefore different from the original answer due to the introduced operator error in step 1.",

        "explanation": "In this example, the addition in step 3 is changed to subtraction, which is an operator error. By changing + to -, the equation 3 1/2 * B + 4 1/2 * B = 8B becomes 3 1/2 * B - 4 1/2 * B = -1B. This error results in a transformed solution that incorrectly implies that they sold a negative number of bars, which impacts the final calculation of the number of bars in a box. Subsequent steps are affected; step 4 calculates the number of chocolate bars in a box based on the incorrect total number of bars sold, but it is calculated correctly based on the erroneous quantity. The calculation after changing the operator is correct for the new erroneous context, resulting in a transformed answer that is different from the original.",

In step 2, the equation is now '9 - 2 = 7' resulting from the changed age of Corey, and in step 3, the equation becomes '7 - 5 = 2' due to Amy being 5 years older than Jackson, which has now been calculated based on the incorrect age of Amy. It should be noted that other than the erroneous operator change in step 1, the calculations in all other steps correctly follow through from the error.",
