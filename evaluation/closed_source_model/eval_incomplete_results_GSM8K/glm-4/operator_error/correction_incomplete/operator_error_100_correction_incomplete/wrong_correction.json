        "question": "Steve's new book sells 1,000,000 copies. He got an advance to pay for 100,000 copies. He gets $2 for each copy of the book sold. His agent takes 10% of that. How much money did he keep not counting the money from the advance?",
        "original_solution": "He sold 1,000,000-100,000=900,000 not counting the advance\nSo he made 900,000*2=$1,800,000 from selling the books\nHis agent took 1,800,000*.1=$180,000\nThat means he kept 1,800,000-180,000=$1,620,000\n#### 1620000",
        "original_answer": 1620000.0,

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example turns the subtraction in step 1 into addition, and by changing - to +, 1,000,000-100,000=900,000 becomes 1,000,000+100,000=1,100,000. This affects the subsequent related step 2, 3, and 4. Step 2 changes from 900,000*2=$1,800,000 to 1,100,000*2=$2,200,000, step 3 changes from 1,800,000*.1=$180,000 to 2,200,000*.1=$220,000, and step 4 changes from 1,800,000-180,000=$1,620,000 to 2,200,000-220,000=$1,980,000. It should be noted that only the operator in step 1 is incorrect, but its calculation is correct, which leads to its result being incorrect. This affects the subsequent steps of using its results, but all the calculation of the steps affected by step 1 is correct.",

        "corrected_solution": "He sold 1,000,000 - 100,000 = 900,000 copies not counting the advance.\nHe earns $2 per copy, so he made 900,000 * $2 = $1,800,000 from selling these copies.\nHis agent takes 10% of this amount, which is $1,800,000 * 0.10 = $180,000.\nSo Steve kept $1,800,000 - $180,000 = $1,620,000 not counting the advance.",
        "corrected_answer": 1.62,
        "corrected_explanation": "The explanation correctly calculates the number of copies sold not counting the advance, multiplies this by the amount Steve gets per copy, and then subtracts the agent's 10% commission to find out how much Steve kept."

        "original_solution": "We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = 200 books.\nSo the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = 600 books.\n#### 600",

        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example changes the addition of 44 + 66 to multiplication, 44 * 66, in step 1. As a result, the total number of books that were sold is incorrectly increased from 200 to 2940 books, affecting the calculation in the subsequent step. The calculation for the total number of unsold books then becomes 800 - 2940 = -2140, which is an incorrect number because you cannot have a negative number of books unsold. It should be noted that the error is only in the operator changed in step 1, but the calculations for step 1 and step 2 are done correctly based on the erroneous operation.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "To find the total number of books sold, we add the number of books sold each day: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = 210 books.\nThen, to find the number of books not sold, we subtract the total sold from the initial stock: 800 - 210 = 590 books.",
        "corrected_answer": 590.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The original solution incorrectly added the number of books sold on Thursday and Friday, and seems to have multiplied them instead of adding. The correct calculation is to add all the numbers together to find the total sold, then subtract that from the initial stock to find the number of books not sold."

        "explanation": "This example changes the subtraction operator in step 3 to division, turning 80 seconds - 7 seconds into 80 seconds / 7 seconds. The result of the modified step 3 is calculated correctly based on the operator change, which is 11.43 seconds for Tiffany's time. This affects the overall calculation in step 4, where the total time for the team is now incorrectly computed based on the new, incorrect time for Tiffany, resulting in the sum of 80 + 40 + 30 + 11.43 seconds. All other steps and calculations are performed correctly, but the modified step 3 impacts the related final step, thereby altering the final result to be incorrect.",

        "corrected_answer": 40.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly divided Mary's time by 7 instead of subtracting 7. The times for each runner should be added to get the total time: Jen's 30 seconds + Susan's 40 seconds + Mary's 80 seconds + Tiffany's 73 seconds."
