        "question": "Jerry needs to shingle 3 roofs. Each roof is made of two slanted rectangular sides measuring 20 feet by 40 feet. If he needs 8 shingles to cover one square foot of roof, how many shingles does he need total?",
        "original_solution": "First find the area of one side of a roof: 20 feet * 40 feet = 800 square feet\nThen multiply that number by 2 to find the total area of both sides of the roof: 800 square feet/side * 2 sides = 1600 square feet\nThen multiply that number by the number of roofs to find the total area of all the roofs: 1600 square feet/roof * 3 roofs = 4800 square feet\nThen multiply the total area of the roofs by the number of shingles needed per square foot to find the total number of shingles needed: 4800 square feet * 8 singles/square foot = 38400 shingles\n#### 38400",
        "original_answer": 38400.0,
        "transformed_solution": "First find the area of one side of a roof: 20 feet + 40 feet + 20 feet + 40 feet = 120 square feet\n",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and area of rectangle. The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the sum of all its sides, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle, resulting in 20 feet * 40 feet = 800 square feet in the original_solution becoming 20 feet + 40 feet + 20 feet + 40 feet = 120 square feet in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent related steps due to the propagation of the error in the calculations, changing the original answers from 1600 square feet, 4800 square feet, and 38400 shingles to the transformed answers of 240 square feet, 720 square feet, and 5760 shingles respectively. Note that the language description of step 1 <First find the area of one side of a roof> in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that only step 1 has the confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes follow this mistaken step correctly.",

        "corrected_solution": "First find the area of one side of a roof: 20 feet * 40 feet = 800 square feet\nThen find the total area of both sides of one roof: 800 square feet * 2 = 1600 square feet\nNow find the total area of all three roofs: 1600 square feet * 3 = 4800 square feet\nFinally, calculate the total number of shingles needed: 4800 square feet * 8 shingles/square foot = 38400 shingles",
        "corrected_answer": 38400.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length by the width, not by adding them. Each roof has two sides, so the area of one side needs to be doubled. Then, the total area of all three roofs is found by multiplying the area of one roof by 3. The number of shingles needed is found by multiplying the total area by the number of shingles needed per square foot."

        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the area and perimeter of the rectangle. The question requires solving for the total area of the mural in order to know how many square-inch tiles are needed, which is the product of its length and height, not the sum. This change is made by swapping multiplication for addition, transforming the correct area formula (length * height) into an incorrect perimeter one (length + height), thus altering the calculation from 180 inches * 120 inches = 21600 square inches to 180 inches + 120 inches = 300 inches. This fundamentally changes the answer from an area to what would be a linear measure, affecting only the formula in step 3 while leaving the language descriptions and the calculations in the prior steps unchanged. As such, the confused formula results in an erroneous count of tiles that would be needed if the mural's perimeter rather than its area were relevant.",
