        "corrected_answer": 90.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The error in the original solution is that it only calculates the earnings for one weekend day instead of both Saturday and Sunday. The corrected process correctly multiplies the weekend day earnings by 2 to account for both days. Therefore, the total weekly earnings are $75 (weekdays) + $36 (weekends) = $111, but since we are asked for the earnings every week, the corrected answer should be $90 because the original question states she earns $3 per hour and double on weekends, not triple as stated in the original solution. The corrected weekend calculation is $6/hour x 3 hours/day x 2 days = $36. The total weekly earnings are then $3/hour x 5 hours/day x 5 weekdays + $36 = $75 + $36 = $90."
