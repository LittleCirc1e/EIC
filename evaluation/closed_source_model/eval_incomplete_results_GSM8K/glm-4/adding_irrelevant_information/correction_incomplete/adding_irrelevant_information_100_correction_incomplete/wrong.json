        "original_solution": "He needs food for 21 days because 3 x 7 = 21\nThe puppy will eat 7 cups of food because 21 x (1/3) = 7\nHe needs 2 bags of food because 7 / 3.5 = 2\nThe food will cost him $4 because 2 x 2 = 4\nIt will cost $14 in total because 10 + 4 = 14\n#### 14",

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the amount of food needed for 3 weeks and the corresponding cost. It correctly determines that 7 cups of food are required, which is exactly what 2 bags of 3.5 cups each will provide. The cost calculation of $4 for the food is also correct. Additionally, the initial cost of the puppy is stated as $10. Therefore, the total cost, which is not explicitly calculated in the solution, would be $10 (puppy) + $4 (food) = $14."
