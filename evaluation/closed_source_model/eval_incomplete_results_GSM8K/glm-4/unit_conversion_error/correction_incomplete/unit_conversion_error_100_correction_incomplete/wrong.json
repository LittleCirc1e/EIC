        "question": "Every hour past noon shadows from a building stretch an extra 5 feet, starting at zero at noon. How long are the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon in inches?",
        "original_solution": "If the shadows lengthen by 5 feet per hour, this means that in 6 hours the shadows would have lengthened from zero to 5*6=30 feet.\nSince there are 12 inches in every foot, this means the building's shadow would be 30*12= 360 inches in length.\n#### 360",
        "original_answer": 360.0,
        "transformed_solution": "If the shadows lengthen by 5 feet per hour, this means that in 6 hours the shadows would have lengthened from zero to 5*6=30 feet.\nSince there are 10 inches in every foot, this means the building's shadow would be 30*10= 300 inches in length.\n",

        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 foot is wrongly equal to 10 inches instead of 12 inches, resulting in 30*12= 360 inches in the original_solution becoming 30*10= 300 inches in the transformed_solution. This is the unit conversion error, and the previous calculation step that finds the total feet of shadow after 6 hours remains correct.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "corrected_solution": "none",
        "corrected_answer": null,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates that the shadows lengthen by 5 feet per hour and then multiplies that by 6 hours to get 30 feet. It then converts the feet to inches by multiplying by 10, which is the correct conversion factor. Therefore, the solution arrives at the correct answer of 300 inches."

        "question": "It takes a dog groomer 10 minutes to dry a short-haired dog like a beagle. It takes him twice as long to dry a full-haired, fluffy dog like a german shepherd. One morning, he has 6 short-haired dogs to dry and 9 full-haired dogs to dry. How many hours does it take him to dry all of the dogs?",
        "original_solution": "It takes 10 minutes to dry the coat of a short-haired dog and twice as long for a full haired dog so they take 10*2 = 20 minutes to dry\nHe had 6 short hair dogs and they took 10 minutes to dry each so they took 6*10= 60 minutes to dry\nHe had 9 full haired dogs that took 20 minutes to dry each so they took 9*20 = 180 minutes to dry\nTogether is takes him 60+180 = 240 minutes to dry all of the dogs\n60 minutes are in 1 hour and he spends 240 minutes on the dogs so he worked for 240/60 = 4 hours drying the dogs\n#### 4",

The error in unit conversion only affects the last calculation related to the conversion between minutes and hours, and the other calculation processes concerning the drying time per dog breed are correct and unchanged.",
