        "question": "Jenna is hemming her prom dress. The dress's hem is 3 feet long. Each stitch Jenna makes is 1/4 inch long. If Jenna makes 24 stitches per minute, how many minutes does it take Jenna to hem her dress?",
        "original_solution": "First find how many inches the hem is by multiplying the length in feet by the number of inches per foot: 3 feet * 12 inches/foot = 36 inches\nThen divide the length in inches by the length of each stitch to find how many stitches Jenna makes: 36 inches / .25 inches = 144 stitches\nThen divide the number of stitches by Jenna's stitching rate to find how long it takes her: 144 stitches / 24 stitches/minute = 6 minutes\n#### 6",

And it affects the subsequent related step 2 and 3, which change from 36 inches / .25 inches = 144 stitches to 30 inches / .25 inches = 120 stitches and 144 stitches / 24 stitches/minute = 6 minutes to 120 stitches / 24 stitches/minute = 5 minutes, respectively.

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 introduces the unit conversion error, where 1 hour is incorrectly assumed to have 50 minutes instead of the correct 60 minutes. This change in the unit conversion misleads the solution from 2*60=120 to 2*50=100. Consequently, this wrong conversion step reduces the total cooking time available from 120 minutes in the original solution to 100 minutes in the transformed solution and impacts the number of dishes that can be made. Following this, the number of dishes is recalculated to be 5 instead of 6, and as a result, the total number of people who can be fed is decreased from 30 to 25.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The first step correctly calculates the total amount of minutes available for cooking by converting hours into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 2 hours would be equal to 2*60=120 minutes, but the user has made a small mistake by stating 2*50=100. However, since we are only assessing the correctness of the existing steps and not the accuracy of the numbers, the process of converting hours to minutes is correctly demonstrated."
