It should be noted that step 3 in the transformed_solution <The total number of questions that Meryll has to write is 35 questions + 15 questions = 50 questions.> should be the same as the step 3 in the original_solution <The total number of questions that Meryll has to write is 35 questions + 15 questions = 50 questions.> and calculates its result 50 correctly. Step 4 affects the subsequent step 5 related to it, changing from 50 questions - 19 questions = 31 questions more to 50 questions - 20 questions = 30 questions more.

It also correctly adds the total number of questions she needs to write (35 multiple-choice + 15 problem-solving = 50 questions) and the total number she has already written (14 multiple-choice + 5 problem-solving = 19 questions). Therefore, to find out how many more questions she needs to write, one would subtract 19 from 50, which the solution implies but does not explicitly state."

However, the final calculation is missing from the provided solution. The correct calculation would be 385 hens * 3 eggs/hen = 1155 eggs."
