        "question": "Harry is counting the hours that he sleeps. On Monday night, he sleeps for 8 hours. On Tuesday night, he sleeps for 7 hours. On Wednesday night, he sleeps for 8 hours. On Thursday night, he sleeps for 10 hours. On Friday night he sleeps for 7 hours. What is the average number of hours that Harry sleeps in one night?",
        "original_solution": "Across Monday through Friday, the total number of hours Harry sleeps is 8 + 7 + 8 + 10 + 7 = 40 hours\nThe total number of days from Monday through Friday is 5 days\nThe average number of hours Harry sleeps in one night is 40 / 5 = 8 hours\n#### 8",
        "original_answer": 8.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Across Monday through Friday, the total number of hours Harry sleeps is 8 + 7 + 8 + 10 + 7 = 40 hours\nThe total number of days from Monday through Thursday is 4 days\n",

        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 erroneously counts Monday to Thursday as 4 days instead of including Friday to make 5 days. This modification led to a miscalculation in step 3, changing it from 40/5=8 to 40/4=10. It should be noted that only the counting error in step 2 was considered, with all subsequent steps being affected by this error while the previous steps remain correct. This led to a different transformed_answer of 10, compared to the original_answer of 8.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the total number of hours Harry sleeps and the total number of days, and then divides the total hours by the total days to find the average number of hours slept per night."

On each of Wednesday and Thursday, twice the number of cars that passed through the toll booth on Monday went through the toll booth. If, for the remaining of the days of the week, an equal number of vehicles passed through the toll booth, calculate the total number of cars that passed the toll both in each of the remaining days.",

He drank nine liters of water on Monday, Thursday and Saturday and 8 liters of water on Tuesday, Friday and Sunday. Unfortunately, no data was input on Wednesday. How many liters of water did he drink on Wednesday?",
        "original_solution": "Gumball's total water intake on Monday, Thursday, and Saturday is 9 x 3 = 27 liters.\nAnd his total water intake on Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday is 8 x 3 = 24 liters.\nSo his total water intake for 6 days is 24 + 27 = 51 liters.\nTherefore Gumball's water intake on Wednesday is 60 - 51 = 9 liters.\n#### 9",
