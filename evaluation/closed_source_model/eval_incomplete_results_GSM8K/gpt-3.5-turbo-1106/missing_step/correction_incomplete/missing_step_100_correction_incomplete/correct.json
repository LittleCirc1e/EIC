        "explanation": "This example removes intermediate step 1. In the original_solution, step 1 calculates the amount Gina pays for tuition and step 3 references the result 6300 from step 1. After removing step 1, step 3's reference to 6300 has no prior context, so it ends up being incorrectly added as an additional number without the correct calculation. To correct step 2 in transformed_solution, which is also step 3 in original_solution, the tuition should be added correctly by multiplying her number of credits by the cost per credit (14 * 450) then adding the result to textbooks and facilities fee. Therefore, the error in the transformed solution occurs in missing the multiplication of 14 credits by the cost per credit, leading to an additional $200 sum in the total for no reason, raising the transformed answer to $7300 instead of the correct $7100. So, the wrong_step is referenced as 2.",
