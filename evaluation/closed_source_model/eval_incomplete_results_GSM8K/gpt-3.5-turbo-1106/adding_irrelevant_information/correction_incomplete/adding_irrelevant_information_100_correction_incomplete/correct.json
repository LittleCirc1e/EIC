        "original_solution": "The reseller wants to get $3000 x 15/100 = $450 profit.\nThus, she needs to sell it for $3000 + $450 = $3450.\n#### 3450",
        "original_answer": 3450.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The reseller wants to get $3000 x 15/100 = $450 profit. Because she provides premium packaging which costs $50, the total cost increases to $3050.\n",

This affects step 2, changing the sum from $3000 + $450 to $3050 + $450. The transformed_answer is thus changed to $3500. It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct.",
