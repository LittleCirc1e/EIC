The clothes take 30 minutes to wash. The towels take twice as long as the clothes to wash. The sheets take 15 minutes less time to wash than the towels. How many minutes total will it take for Naomi to wash everything?",
        "original_solution": "The clothes take 30 minutes to wash and the towels take twice as long, 30 x 2 = 60 minutes to wash the towels.\nThe sheets take 15 minutes less than the towels, 60 - 15 = 45 minutes to wash the sheets.\nIt takes 30 minutes + 60 minutes + 45 minutes = 135 minutes to wash everything.\n#### 135",

        "transformed_solution": "The clothes take 30 minutes to wash and the towels take twice as long, 30 x 2 = 60 minutes to wash the towels.\nBecause Naomi also needs to wash a delicate blouse which takes the same amount of time as the clothes, the sheets take 15 minutes less than the towels, 60 - 15 = 45 minutes to wash the sheets.\nIt takes 30 minutes for clothes + 30 minutes for the delicate blouse + 60 minutes for towels + 45 minutes for sheets = 165 minutes to wash everything.\n",
