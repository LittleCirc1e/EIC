One machine can produce 2 kg of material every hour. The factory sells the produced material for $50 per 1 kg. How much can this factory earn in one day?",
        "original_solution": "The total runtime for the first three machines is 3 machines * 23 hours/day/machine = 69 hours/day.\nSo these machines could produce 69 hours/day * 2 kg/hour = 138 kg/day.\nThe fourth machine could produce 12 hours/day * 2 kg/hour = 24 kg/day of material.\nIn total all the machines would produce 138 kg/day + 24 kg/day = 162 kg/day of material.\nThe factory would therefore earn 162 kg/day * $50/kg = $8100/day.\n#### 8100",

        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references the total produced by the first three machines as 138 kg/day and the fourth machine as 20 kg/day (implicitly, since 156 - 138 = 18, which could be misconstrued as 12 hours * 1.5 kg/hour for a total of 18 kg/day) from steps 2 and 3 by changing the correct sum 138 kg/day + 24 kg/day = 162 kg/day to an incorrect sum 138 kg/day + 24 kg/day = 156 kg/day. It should be noted that steps 2 and 3 in the transformed_solution should be the same as the steps 2 and 3 in the original_solution and should have their result numbers calculated correctly. Step 5, as the subsequent step of step 4, is affected and changes the total earning from 162 kg/day * $50/kg = $8100/day to 156 kg/day * $50/kg = $7800/day. The referencing error only occurs at step 4, and thus all calculations for the other steps are still correct. The consequence of this single referencing error is that the transformed_answer changes to $7800, which is different from the original_answer of $8100.",
