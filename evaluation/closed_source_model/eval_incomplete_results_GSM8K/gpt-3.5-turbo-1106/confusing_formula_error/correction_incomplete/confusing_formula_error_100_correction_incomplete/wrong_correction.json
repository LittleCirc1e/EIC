        "question": "Jill is going to resod her front yard. The plot of land in front of her house is 200 feet wide by 50 feet. Her house has a sidewalk that is 3 feet wide and 50 feet long. There are also four flower beds: two right in front of the house that are 4 feet deep by 25 feet long, one that is 10 feet by 12 feet, and a fourth that is 7 feet by 8 feet. How many square feet of sod will she need to cover her yard, minus the sidewalk and flower beds?",
        "original_solution": "The area of the whole front yard is 200 feet by 50 feet, or 200 ft * 50 ft = 10,000 sq.ft.\nThe sidewalk is 3 feet by 50 feet, or 3ft * 50ft = 150 sq.ft.\nEach of the flower beds right in front of the house is 4 feet by 25 feet, or 4 ft * 25 ft = 100 sq.ft. There are two, so that's 2 * 100 sq.ft. = 200 sq.ft.\nThe third flower bed is 10 feet by 12 feet, or 10ft * 12ft = 120 sq.ft.\nThe fourth flower bed is 7 feet by 8 feet, or 7ft * 8ft = 56 sq.ft.\nThe total area of the sidewalk and flower beds is 150 sq.ft + 200 sq.ft + 120 sq.ft + 56 sq.ft = 526 sq. ft.\nSo Jill will need a total of 10,000 sq.ft - 526 sq.ft = 9,474 sq.ft. of sod.\n#### 9474",

The original solution correctly uses the formula for the perimeter of a square (4*side), replacing this with the area calculation formula (side*side) in the transformed solution. As a result, the original calculation for the perimeter: 4*20 = 80 cm is incorrectly changed to an area calculation: 20*20 = 400 cm, which falsely represents the perimeter of the square paper instead of its area. This error then affects step 2, where the sum calculates the height of the computer screen using the mistaken value, changing from 20+80 = 100 cm to 20+400 = 420 cm. The language descriptions in the solution steps remain the same; only the formula used is altered to create the erroneous transformed solution.

        "original_solution": "First find the area of one side of a roof: 20 feet * 40 feet = 800 square feet\nThen multiply that number by 2 to find the total area of both sides of the roof: 800 square feet/side * 2 sides = 1600 square feet\nThen multiply that number by the number of roofs to find the total area of all the roofs: 1600 square feet/roof * 3 roofs = 4800 square feet\nThen multiply the total area of the roofs by the number of shingles needed per square foot to find the total number of shingles needed: 4800 square feet * 8 singles/square foot = 38400 shingles\n#### 38400",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and area of rectangle. The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the sum of all its sides, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle, resulting in 20 feet * 40 feet = 800 square feet in the original_solution becoming 20 feet + 40 feet + 20 feet + 40 feet = 120 square feet in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent related steps due to the propagation of the error in the calculations, changing the original answers from 1600 square feet, 4800 square feet, and 38400 shingles to the transformed answers of 240 square feet, 720 square feet, and 5760 shingles respectively. Note that the language description of step 1 <First find the area of one side of a roof> in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that only step 1 has the confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes follow this mistaken step correctly.",

        "corrected_answer": 7680.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The area of one side of the roof is 20 feet * 40 feet = 800 square feet. Since there are two sides to each roof, the total area for one roof is 800 square feet * 2 = 1600 square feet. Therefore, the total area for 3 roofs is 1600 square feet * 3 = 4800 square feet. Multiplying by 8 shingles per square foot gives 4800 square feet * 8 shingles = 38400 shingles."

        "original_solution": "The marble statue has a volume of 2*2*8=32 cubic meters\nSo that means it has a weight of 2700*32=86,400 kg\n#### 86,400",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and volume calculations. The original_solution properly calculates the volume of the rectangular prism by multiplying the side of the square base with itself and then by the height (2*2*8), but the transformed_solution incorrectly treats the calculation as if finding the perimeter of the base (2+2+2+2). By changing the formula from volume to perimeter, the result is an incorrect volume calculation, influencing the subsequent weight calculation in step 2. As a result, the original_solution's correct volume of 32 cubic meters used to find the weight (2700*32) is erroneously transformed to an incorrect volume of 8 cubic meters (2+2+2+2) and the subsequent incorrect weight (2700*8). It's important to note that only step 1 has been modified to introduce the confusing formula error, affecting the related step 2, while no language description has been changed.",

Then, multiply the volume by the density (2700) to get the weight, which equals 86400 kg. Converting this to metric tons gives 86.4 tons."
