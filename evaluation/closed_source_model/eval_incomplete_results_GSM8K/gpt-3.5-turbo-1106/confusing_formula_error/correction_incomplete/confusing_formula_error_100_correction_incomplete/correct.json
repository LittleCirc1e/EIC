The question requires that the values of two sides be added—since it’s a linear measure of perimeter—resulting in 40+50=90 cm in the original solution. By changing the addition to multiplication (40*50=2000 cm), we make an error reflecting confusion between linear and area measures. This affects the subsequent step 2 (the calculation for the remaining side), changing the correct subtraction from 160-90=70 cm to an incorrect subtraction 160-2000=-1840 cm.
