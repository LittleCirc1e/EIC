        "question": "A school needs to paint the classroom, which is 9 meters long, 8 meters wide, and 3 meters high. The classroom has 4 windows, 2 blackboards, and 2 doors. The windows are 1m by 1.5m, the blackboards are 6m by 1m, and the doors are 2m by 1m. It is known that the paint fee is $4.80 per square meter. How much does it cost to paint a classroom?",
        "original_solution": "Because the floor does not require painting, the total surface area of the classroom excluding the floor, is 9 * 8+8 * 3 * 2+9 * 3 * 2=174 square meters.\n One window has an area of 1 * 1.5=1.5 square meters.\n Four windows have an area of 4 * 1.5=6 square meters.\n One blackboard has an area of 6 * 1=6 square meters.\n Two blackboards have an area of 2 * 6=12 square meters.\n One door has an area of 2 * 1=2 square meters.\n Two doors have an area of 2 * 2=4 square meters.\n And the area that needs to be painted is 174-6-12-4=152 square meters.\n Because the paint fee of $4.80 is required per square meter, painting a classroom costs 152 * 4.8=$729.6.\n#### 729.6",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the sum of lengths and the surface area. The question requires that the surface area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by the width for the walls, resulting in the correct formula 9*8 for the roof and 8*3*2+9*3*2 for the walls in the original_solution. In the transformed_solution, the formula incorrectly changes to the sum of lengths in step 1, leading to 9 + 8 + 8 + 9 + 3 * 2 + 3 * 2 = 44. Consequently, the transformed solution incorrectly estimates the area of the classroom, which directly affects the subsequent calculation of the total cost of the paint. Note that only the formula at step 1 was changed to confuse the perimeter with the surface area, while all other calculations related to areas of windows, blackboards, and doors, as well as the cost calculation, continue correctly based on the initial incorrect surface area.",

In the original solution, we correctly add 2 ft to each side (length and width), which in the context of the problem, should only be a single addition to represent the extension on one side. However, in the transformed solution, the step has been altered to adding 2 ft on each side twice, implying that the length and width are being extended on both sides of each dimension, effectively doubling the intended extension. This mistake alters both the new length and the new width calculations, and thus changes the new area of the bathroom calculation. Note that the language description of step 2 and 3 in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution.
