        "question": "Amanda is figuring out how many bags of grass seed she needs to buy to cover a new lot the city is turning into a park. The lot measures 120 feet by 60 feet. One section that measures 40 feet by 40 feet will be covered with concrete, and the rest needs to be covered in grass seeds. Each bag of grass seeds covers 56 square feet. How many bags of grass seeds does Amanda need?",
        "original_solution": "First find the area of the lot by multiplying the width and the length: 120 ft * 60 ft = 7200 sq ft.\nThen find the area of the square covered in concrete: 40 ft * 40 ft = 1600 sq ft.\nThen subtract the concrete area from the total area to find the grassy area: 7200 sq ft - 1600 sq ft = 5600 sq ft.\nFinally, divide this area by the area each bag covers to find the number of bags: 5600 sq ft / 56 sq ft/bag = 100 bags.\n#### 100",

In the transformed_solution, step 2 incorrectly computes the perimeter of the square when the question is actually asking for the area that will be covered in concrete. This confusion between calculating the area and perimeter of the concrete section leads to a miscomputation of the grassy area needing seeds and hence the number of bags required. The transformed solution, therefore, inadvertently calculates the perimeter using 40 ft + 40 ft + 40 ft + 40 ft = 160 ft instead of the area using 40 ft * 40 ft = 1600 sq ft. All other steps in the transformed_solution correctly use the formulas and calculations based on this incorrect step, resulting in a different transformed_answer from the original_answer.",
