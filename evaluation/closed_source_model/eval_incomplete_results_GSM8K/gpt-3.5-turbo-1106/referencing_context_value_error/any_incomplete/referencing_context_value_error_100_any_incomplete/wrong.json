        "question": "In soccer, players receive yellow cards when they are cautioned and red cards when they are sent off. Coach Tim has a team of 11 players, 5 of them didn't receive cautions, the rest received one yellow card each. How many red cards would the whole team collect, knowing that each red card corresponds to 2 yellow cards?",
        "original_solution": "In coach Tim's team, 5 out of 11 players did not receive any caution, so 11 - 5 = 6 players were cautioned.\nEach cautioned player received a yellow card, so all the cautioned players received 6 * 1 = 6 yellow cards.\nKnowing that each red card corresponds to 2 yellow cards, the team would have 6 / 2 = 3 red cards.\n#### 3",
        "original_answer": 3.0,
        "transformed_solution": "In coach Tim's team, 10 out of 11 players did not receive any caution, so 11 - 10 = 1 player was cautioned.\n",

Its subsequent related steps will be affected by the erroneous result but still be calculated correctly. Step 2 changes from 6 * 1 = 6 yellow cards to 1 * 1 = 1 yellow card, and step 3 changes from 6 / 2 = 3 red cards to 1 / 2 = 0.5 red cards. Please note that you should only consider one error, so step 2 and 3 still correctly calculate results based on the erroneous first step.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The solution correctly identifies that 1 player out of 11 received a yellow card. Since each red card corresponds to 2 yellow cards, the team would collect 1/2 = 0.5 red cards, which is not possible, so the answer is 0 red cards."

        "question": "The rim of a standard basketball hoop is 10 feet above the ground.  Additionally, most experts will say that a player must be able to reach at least 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball.  Suppose a basketball player is 6 feet tall and can reach 22 inches above their head using the wingspan of their arms.  How high must this player be able to jump to reach 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball?",
        "original_solution": "In inches, the height of the rim is 10*12 = 120 inches.\nThus, the height that the player needs to be able to reach is 120 + 6 = 126 inches.\nWithout jumping, the player can reach their height plus an additional 22 inches, or a total of 6*12 + 22 = 94 inches.\nTherefore, the player needs to jump 126 - 94 = 32 inches to reach the height required to dunk a basketball.\n#### 32",
