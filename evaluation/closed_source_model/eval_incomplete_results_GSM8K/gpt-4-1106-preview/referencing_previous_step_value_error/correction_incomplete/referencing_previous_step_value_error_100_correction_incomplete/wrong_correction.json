        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references B + B + 7 = 43 as B + B/2 + 7 = 43, changing 2B + 7 = 43 to 1.5B + 7 = 43 and as a result, changing the calculation in step 5 to 2B + B = 36 incorrectly. The subsequent steps 6, 7, and 8 are affected by this error and calculate new and erroneous values for B, David, and Lily, but still follow the correct calculation process based on the incorrect value. It should be noted that step 3 in the transformed_solution <B + B/2 + 7 = 43> is the point where the referencing error occurs, while the equivalent step 3 in the original_solution <B + B + 7 = 43> and its result 2B = 36 should remain unchanged, ensuring the error occurs only at the point of reference and that all calculations following the erroneous reference are internally consistent and correct.",

        "corrected_answer": 13,
        "corrected_explanation": "The correct process is to set up the equation with B representing the number of insects Bodhi collected. David found half as many as Bodhi, so David found B/2. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (B/2) + 7. The sum of insects found by all three is B + (B/2) + (B/2) + 7 = 43. Simplifying the equation, we get 3B + 7 = 43. Solving for B gives us B = 12. Therefore, David found 6 insects, and Lily found 13 insects."
