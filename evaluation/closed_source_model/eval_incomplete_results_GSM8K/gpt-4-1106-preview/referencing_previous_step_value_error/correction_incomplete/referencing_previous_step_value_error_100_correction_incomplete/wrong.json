        "explanation": "Step 5 mistakenly references 75 as 80 from step 4 and changes 75=(3/2)x to 80=(3/2)x. It should be noted that step 4 in the transformed_solution <70=(3/2)x-5> should be the same as the step 4 in the original_solution <70=(3/2)x-5> and calculates its result 75 correctly. The changed reference affects only the subsequent steps that directly involve the value from the erroneous step but still uses correct arithmetic. Therefore, step 6 is affected by step 5 and changes from 75=(3/2)x to 80=(3/2)x, leading to an incorrect value for x. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all other steps is still correct.",

Since Lionel can make only 5 cheesecakes with the 15 packets of Oreos, he will use 10 boxes of Graham crackers (2 boxes per cheesecake). He originally had 14 boxes, so after making 5 cheesecakes, he will have 14 - 10 = 4 boxes of Graham crackers left over.

It should be noted that steps 2 and 3 in the transformed_solution should be the same as the steps 2 and 3 in the original_solution and should have their result numbers calculated correctly.
