        "question": "Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's hair. Emily’s hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair. If Logan hair is 20 inches, how many inches is Kate’s hair?",
        "original_solution": "Emily’s hair is 20-6 = 14 inches long.\nKate's hair 14/2= 7 inches long.\n#### 7",
        "original_answer": 7.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Emily’s hair is 20+6 = 26 inches long.\n",
        "transformed_answer": 13.0,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example changes the subtraction in the original solution step 1 to addition, turning '20-6 = 14 inches' into '20+6 = 26 inches'. Subsequently, step 2, which calculates the length of Kate's hair based on the length of Emily's hair, now uses the incorrect figure from step 1 but does the calculation correctly. Thus, '14/2= 7 inches' is transformed into '26/2= 13 inches'. The transformed answer is therefore different from the original answer due to the introduced operator error in step 1.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "corrected_solution": "none",
        "corrected_answer": null,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates Emily's hair length by adding 6 inches to Logan's hair length, which is 20 inches. Then, since Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's, and Emily's hair is 26 inches, Kate's hair would indeed be half of 26 inches, which is 13 inches. The solution does not explicitly state this final step, but the process is correct."
