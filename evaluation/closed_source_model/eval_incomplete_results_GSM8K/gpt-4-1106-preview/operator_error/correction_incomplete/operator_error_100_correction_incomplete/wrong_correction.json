        "explanation": "The error is introduced by changing the subtraction of (X - 1) to addition in the second step. This turns the equation 15 - X - 2X - (X-1) = 16 = 4X into 15 - X - 2X + (X-1) = 16 = 2X, incorrectly simplifying the ages.

Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?",
        "original_solution": "Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $2 on the jogger jeans.\nSo, he saved $6 - $2 = $4 on the tattered jeans.\nThe original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.\nCole bought the tattered jeans for $28\nHence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.\nTherefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $8 more than the tattered jeans.\n#### 8",

        "explanation": "This example changes the subtraction in step 2 to an addition, transforming $6 - $2 = $4 into $6 + $2 = $8. This affects subsequent related step 4 and step 5. Step 4 remains unchanged because no other steps affected the purchase price of the tattered jeans. However, the revised savings calculation in step 5, $28 + $8 = $36, leads to the changed conclusion in step 6, stating that jogger jeans originally cost $36 - $24 = $12 more than the tattered jeans instead of $8.

He saved 1/3 of the total savings on the jogger jeans, which is $6 * 1/3 = $2.\nHe saved the rest on the tattered jeans, which is $6 - $2 = $4.\nThe jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so their original price was $28 - $6 = $22.\nSince Cole saved $2 on the jogger jeans, their sale price was $22 - $2 = $20.\nSince Cole saved $4 on the tattered jeans, their sale price was $28 - $4 = $24.\nTo find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we subtract the original price of the tattered jeans from the original price of the jogger jeans: $28 - $22 = $6.",

This affects the subsequent step where the quantity of milk required is calculated. Instead of dividing the number of cookies by the correct number of cookies baked per half-gallon, the number of cookies is divided by an incorrectly inflated amount due to the operator change.
