        "question": "John builds a box. The box is 26 inches by 26 inches by 14 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick on each side. How much is the internal volume in cubic feet?",
        "original_solution": "The walls take away 2*1=2 inches from each dimension\nSo the longer sides are 26-2=24 inches\nThat is 24/12=2 feet\nThe smaller dimension is 14-2=12 inches\nThat is 12/12=1 foot\nSo the internal volume is 2*2*1=4 cubic feet\n#### 4",
        "original_answer": 4.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The walls take away 2*1=2 inches from each dimension\nSo the longer sides are 26-2=24 inches\nThat is 24/12=2 feet\nThe smaller dimension is 14-2=12 inches\nThat is 12/12=1 foot\n",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 5 confuses the volume and surface area of a cube or cuboid. The question requires that the volume of the cuboid to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width multiplied by height, rather than the sum of products of each pair of dimensions, which is used for calculating perimeter of base or lateral surface area in rectangles. The original solution where the internal volume is calculated as 2*2*1=4 is replaced by a mistaken calculation suggesting the sum of products of dimensions: (2*2)+(2*1)+(1*2)=8 in the transformed_solution. This change in formula for volume results in an incorrect internal volume of 8 cubic feet, while all previous steps that correctly calculated the dimensions in feet remain unchanged.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The solution correctly subtracts 2 inches from each dimension to account for the wall thickness and then converts the internal dimensions from inches to feet."

        "question": "The size of a bathroom is 96 sq ft. If the width of the bathroom is 8 feet and the owner wants to extend it by 2 feet on each side, what is the new area of the bathroom?",
        "original_solution": "The original length of the bathroom is 96 sq ft/8 ft = 12 ft\nThe new length of the bathroom is 12ft + 2 ft = 14 ft\nThe new width of the bathroom is 8 ft + 2 ft = 10 ft\nThe new area of the bathroom is 14ft x 10 ft = 140 sq ft\n#### 140",
        "original_answer": 140.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The original length of the bathroom is 96 sq ft/8 ft = 12 ft\nThe new length of the bathroom is 12ft + 2 ft + 2 ft = 16 ft\n",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, the wrong step involves confusing the process of extending the length and width of the bathroom. In the original solution, we correctly add 2 ft to each side (length and width), which in the context of the problem, should only be a single addition to represent the extension on one side. However, in the transformed solution, the step has been altered to adding 2 ft on each side twice, implying that the length and width are being extended on both sides of each dimension, effectively doubling the intended extension. This mistake alters both the new length and the new width calculations, and thus changes the new area of the bathroom calculation. Note that the language description of step 2 and 3 in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that only this one step has been modified with the confusing formula error, and all the other calculation processes are still correct.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The steps provided in the solution correctly calculate the original length of the bathroom by dividing the area by the width, and then correctly add 2 feet to each side to find the new length."
