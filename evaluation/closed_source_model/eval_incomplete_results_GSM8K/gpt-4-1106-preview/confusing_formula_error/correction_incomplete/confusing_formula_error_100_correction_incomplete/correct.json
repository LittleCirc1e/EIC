        "explanation": "Here, step 6 confuses the volume and surface area of the cuboid. The question requires that the volume of the cuboid to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width multiplied by height, rather than 2 times the sum of the products of the pairs of different dimensions, which is equivalent to the surface area of the cuboid, resulting in 2*2*1=4 in the original_solution becoming 2*(2*1+1*2+2*1)=12 in the transformed_solution.

        "corrected_solution": "First convert the length of the mural to inches: 15 feet * 12 inches/foot = 180 inches\nThen convert the height of the mural to inches: 10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches\nThen multiply the length and the height to find the total area of the mural in square inches: 180 inches * 120 inches = 21600 square inches\nSince each tile is 1 square inch, the number of tiles needed is equal to the area of the mural in square inches.\n",
        "corrected_answer": 21600.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly calculated the perimeter instead of the area. The number of tiles needed is equal to the area of the mural in square inches, not the perimeter. The area is found by multiplying the length by the height, both in inches."

        "question": "John carves a giant marble rectangular prism 8 meters tall with a 2-meter square base. It has a density of 2700 kg per cubic meter. How much does it weigh?",
        "original_solution": "The marble statue has a volume of 2*2*8=32 cubic meters\nSo that means it has a weight of 2700*32=86,400 kg\n#### 86,400",
        "original_answer": 86400.0,

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and volume calculations. The original_solution properly calculates the volume of the rectangular prism by multiplying the side of the square base with itself and then by the height (2*2*8), but the transformed_solution incorrectly treats the calculation as if finding the perimeter of the base (2+2+2+2). By changing the formula from volume to perimeter, the result is an incorrect volume calculation, influencing the subsequent weight calculation in step 2. As a result, the original_solution's correct volume of 32 cubic meters used to find the weight (2700*32) is erroneously transformed to an incorrect volume of 8 cubic meters (2+2+2+2) and the subsequent incorrect weight (2700*8). It's important to note that only step 1 has been modified to introduce the confusing formula error, affecting the related step 2, while no language description has been changed.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "The volume of the marble statue is calculated by multiplying its height by the area of the base. The area of the base is 2 meters * 2 meters = 4 square meters. The volume is then 4 square meters * 8 meters = 32 cubic meters. The weight of the statue is then calculated by multiplying the volume by the density. Weight = 32 cubic meters * 2700 kg/cubic meter = 86400 kg.",
        "corrected_answer": 86400.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution provided incorrectly calculates the volume of the rectangular prism. The correct method is to multiply the area of the base by the height of the prism to find the volume, and then multiply the volume by the density to find the weight."
