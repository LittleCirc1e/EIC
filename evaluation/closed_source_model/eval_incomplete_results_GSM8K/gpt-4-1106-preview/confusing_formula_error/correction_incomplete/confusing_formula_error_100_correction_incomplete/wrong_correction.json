The surface area includes the walls and ceiling, not the floor, and should be calculated using the formula for area, not perimeter. The original solution used the correct approach to calculate surface area, but the transformed solution incorrectly calculates the classroom's perimeter instead, resulting in the formula (9+8)*2+8 * 3 * 2+9 * 3 * 2=90 in the transformed_solution. Subsequent calculations subtract the area of windows, doors, and blackboards from this incorrect value. All steps following the initial perimeter calculation are based on the mistaken concept of painting the perimeter of the classroom, not its surface area.",
