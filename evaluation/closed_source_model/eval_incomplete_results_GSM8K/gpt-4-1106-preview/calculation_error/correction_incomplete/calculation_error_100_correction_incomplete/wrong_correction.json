        "original_solution": "Each of her aunts and uncles have a family unit of 1 son + 1 daughter + 1 aunt/uncle = 3 people.\nIris has a total of 3 uncles + 4 aunts = 7 aunts or uncles in these family units.\nSo among her aunts, uncles, and cousins, there will be 7 family units * 3 people in each family unit = 21 people.\nIncluding her mother and brother, there will be a total of 21 people + 1 mother + 1 brother = 23 people coming to her party.\n#### 23",

This error then changes the expected number of people from each family unit and alters all the subsequent steps that rely on this number.

        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Iris has 3 uncles and 4 aunts, each with 1 son and 1 daughter, making 3 + 4 = 7 family units. Each family unit consists of 1 uncle or aunt + 1 son + 1 daughter = 3 people. So, 7 family units * 3 people each = 21 people from the uncles and aunts.

        "corrected_solution": "Mario's $18 cut on Monday would have been 50% more expensive on Sunday.

After correcting the total vacuuming time, we divide by the battery life of the vacuum cleaner to find out how many full charges are needed. Since the vacuum cleaner lasts 10 minutes and it takes 20 minutes to vacuum all rooms, Mary will need to charge it twice. However, since she can't charge it for just half the time needed for the last room, she will actually need to charge it three times to have enough battery to complete the task."
