        "question": "It takes a dog groomer 10 minutes to dry a short-haired dog like a beagle. It takes him twice as long to dry a full-haired, fluffy dog like a german shepherd. One morning, he has 6 short-haired dogs to dry and 9 full-haired dogs to dry. How many hours does it take him to dry all of the dogs?",
        "original_solution": "It takes 10 minutes to dry the coat of a short-haired dog and twice as long for a full haired dog so they take 10*2 = 20 minutes to dry\nHe had 6 short hair dogs and they took 10 minutes to dry each so they took 6*10= 60 minutes to dry\nHe had 9 full haired dogs that took 20 minutes to dry each so they took 9*20 = 180 minutes to dry\nTogether is takes him 60+180 = 240 minutes to dry all of the dogs\n60 minutes are in 1 hour and he spends 240 minutes on the dogs so he worked for 240/60 = 4 hours drying the dogs\n#### 4",

        "transformed_solution": "It takes 10 minutes to dry the coat of a short-haired dog and twice as long for a full haired dog so they take 10*2 = 20 minutes to dry\nHe had 6 short hair dogs and they took 10 minutes to dry each so they took 6*10= 60 minutes to dry\nHe had 9 full haired dogs that took 20 minutes to dry each so they took 9*20 = 180 minutes to dry\nTogether is takes him 60+180 = 240 minutes to dry all of the dogs\n",
        "transformed_answer": 4.8,
        "wrong_step": 4,
        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 4 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 hour is wrongly equal to 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes, resulting in 240/60 = 4 hours in the original_solution becoming 240/50 = 4.8 hours in the transformed_solution. The error in unit conversion only affects the last calculation related to the conversion between minutes and hours, and the other calculation processes concerning the drying time per dog breed are correct and unchanged.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the time taken to dry each type of dog and sums them to find the total time in minutes."
