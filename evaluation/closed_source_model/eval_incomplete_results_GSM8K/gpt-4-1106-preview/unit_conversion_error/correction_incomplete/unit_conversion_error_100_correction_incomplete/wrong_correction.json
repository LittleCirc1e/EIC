        "original_solution": "We have 60 minutes per hour.\nSo, in 24 hours we have 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes.\nSo, the volume of air Ross inhaled in 24 hours is: 17 breaths/minute * 5/9 L/breath * 1440 minutes = 122400 / 9 = 13600 liters.\nThe volume of air inhaled is 13600 liters.\n#### 13600",

Therefore, he can drive 18 miles/gallon * 15 gallons = 270 miles before refilling. He will need to refill 600 miles / 270 miles = 2.22 times, which we round up to 3 times since he can't refill a fraction of a time.
