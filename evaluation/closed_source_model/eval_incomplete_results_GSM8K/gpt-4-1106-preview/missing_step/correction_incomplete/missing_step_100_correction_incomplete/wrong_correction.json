        "question": "Loisa wants to buy a tablet that costs $450 cash. Since she does not have enough money, the store offered her an installment plan for 12 months. She will pay $100 as a down payment and pay $40 for the first 4 months; then $35 for the next four months; then $30 for the last four months. How much will Loisa save if she will buy the tablet in cash instead of on installment?",
        "original_solution": "Loisa will pay a total of $40 x 4 = $160 for the first 4 months.\nShe will pay a total of $35 x 4 = $140 for the next four months.\nAnd she will pay a total of $30 x 4 = $120 for the last four months.\nThus, she will pay a total of $100 + $160 + $140 + $120 = $520 for 12 months including the down payment.\nTherefore, Loisa can save $520 - $450 = $70 if she buys the tablet in cash.\n#### 70",

        "explanation": "This example removes the intermediate step 2 from the original_solution, which calculates the total cost of the tablet for the next four months. After removing this step, step 3 of the transformed_solution makes an error by referencing the result $160 from step 1 again instead of the original $140 for the cost of the middle four months. Consequently, the result $540 incorrectly combines $160 twice instead of using $140. The impact of this error is carried forward in the next calculation, which then assesses the total savings as $540 - $450 = $90. The wrong_step is identified as step 3 because it is the first step that uses the incorrect cost reference from the deleted step in the original_solution.",

On Tuesday, Daisy had 3 dog toys left after losing some, and her owner went to the store and got her 3 more. On Wednesday, all of Daisy's old and new dog toys were missing, so her owner went to the store and bought her 5 more. If Daisy's owner found all the lost dog toys, including the new dog toys, how many dog toys would Daisy have now?",

This makes the calculation now 5 (original toys) + 5 (new toys on Wednesday) instead of 8 (from previous step 1) + 5 (new toys on Wednesday). Subsequently, subsequent steps that would have referenced the 8 now reference the 5. It results in a new total of 5+5=10 dog toys if none were lost, which is different from the original answer, and complies with the requirement that the transformed_solution should have one less step compared to the original_solution.

Uncertain of how many pairs he had of each color, he began to sort his socks. He discovered that he had three more pairs of blue socks than he had pairs of black socks. He had one less pair of red socks than he had pairs of white socks. He had twice as many blue socks as he had of red socks. And he counted a total of 6 red socks. What is the total number of Joseph's socks?",

The change leads to calculating 0 black socks instead of 6, and the remaining steps that calculate the total number of socks refer to this new value. Therefore, removing step 4 causes a fundamental miscalculation in the number of black socks, leading to the first erroneous reference at step 5 in the transformed solution. It should be noted that the number 3 from step 5, referring to how many fewer pairs of black socks there are compared to blue, remains intact as the required reference from the question.
