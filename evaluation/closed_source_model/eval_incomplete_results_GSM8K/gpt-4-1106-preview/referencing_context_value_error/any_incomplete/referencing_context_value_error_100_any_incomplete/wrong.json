        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 1 references 64 in the question as 68 wrongly, and calculates 14-2*k=68 instead of 14-2*k=64. Its subsequent related steps will be affected, calculating 2*k=68+14=82 in step 2, 2k=82 in step 3, and k=82/2=41 in step 4. Please note that you should only consider one error, so step 2 still references 14 in the question correctly.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The solution correctly sets up an equation to represent the problem. The next step would be to solve for k, which represents the number of koi fish in the pond."
