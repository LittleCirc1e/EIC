        "question": "Christina walks 7km to school every day from Monday to Friday. She returns home covering the same distance. Last Friday her mother asked her to pass by her friend, which is another 2km away from the school in the opposite distance from home. How many kilometers did Christina cover that week?",
        "original_solution": "One trip to school is 2 * 7 km = 14km.\nIn one week, Christina walks 14 km/day * 5 days/week = 70km to school.\nThe extra trip to her mum's friend added 2 km * 2 = 4km to her travel distance.\nHer total distance was thus 70 km + 4 km = 74 km\n#### 74",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 erroneously counts the number of days from Monday to Friday as 4 days instead of 5 days, resulting in 14 km/day * 4 days/week = 56km, which affects the calculation of her weekly school travel distance. Subsequent related step 4 also reflects this change, altering the final sum of her total distance from 70 km + 4 km = 74 km to 56 km + 4 km = 60 km. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of counting error, and other calculation processes are still correct.",

        "corrected_solution": "One trip to school and back home is 7 km + 7 km = 14 km.\nFrom Monday to Thursday, Christina walks 14 km/day * 4 days = 56 km.\nOn Friday, she walks to school and back, plus an extra 2 km to her mother's friend, so that's 14 km + 2 km = 16 km.\nTotal distance covered in the week is 56 km + 16 km = 72 km.",
        "corrected_answer": 72.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly calculates the distance Christina walks to school and back in one day as 2 * 7 km, which would imply she only walks one way. The correct calculation is 7 km to school and 7 km back home, totaling 14 km per day. From Monday to Thursday, she covers 56 km in total. On Friday, she walks an additional 2 km to her mother's friend, making it 16 km for that day. The total for the week is 56 km + 16 km = 72 km."

This affects the following step where the total number of slices needed for 52 weeks is also halved from 312 to 156. Subsequently, the calculation in the last step is based on this new total, resulting in the transformed_answer being half of the original_answer. This single counting error of the number of times french toast is made per weekend directly leads to the halved result in the final step of the transformed_solution.",

        "corrected_solution": "She and her husband have 1 slice each and her daughters split 1 slice, so that's 1+1+0.5 = 2.5 slices per day.\nSince she makes french toast on both Saturday and Sunday, the total for the weekend is 2.5 slices/day * 2 days = 5 slices per weekend.\nThere are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of slices needed for the year is 5 slices/weekend * 52 weekends = 260 slices.\nEach loaf contains 12 slices, so the number of loaves needed is 260 slices / 12 slices/loaf.\nTo find out how many whole loaves she needs, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per loaf and round up, because she can't buy a fraction of a loaf.\n260 slices / 12 slices/loaf = 21.6667 loaves.\nRounding up, she will need 22 loaves of bread.",
        "corrected_answer": 22.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly calculated the number of slices per weekend. It should be 2.5 slices per day times 2 days for the weekend, totaling 5 slices per weekend.
