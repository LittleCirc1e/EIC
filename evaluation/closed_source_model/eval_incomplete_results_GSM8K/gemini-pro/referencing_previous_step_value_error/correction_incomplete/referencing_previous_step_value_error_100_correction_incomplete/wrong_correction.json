The solution multiplied the number of cupcakes by $0.75, which does not account for the fact that she threw away some cupcakes. The correct way to calculate the cost of making the cupcakes is to multiply the number of cupcakes she actually sold by the cost per cupcake. Therefore, the corrected solution is: The number of cupcakes she sold is 72-24-5-4 = 39, which she sold at $2.00 each. So, she earned 39 * 2 = $78.00. The cost of making the cupcakes is 39 * $0.75 = $29.25. Her net profit is $78.00 - $29.25 = $48.75."
