        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, the error is introduced in step 2 by counting Monday to Saturday as 5 days instead of 6 days, thereby affecting the final computed total distance covered in a week. The 190 miles/day is erroneously multiplied by 5 days to get 950 miles instead of the correct value of 1,140 miles from the original solution.
