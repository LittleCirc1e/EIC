        "question": "The rim of a standard basketball hoop is 10 feet above the ground.  Additionally, most experts will say that a player must be able to reach at least 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball.  Suppose a basketball player is 6 feet tall and can reach 22 inches above their head using the wingspan of their arms.  How high must this player be able to jump to reach 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball?",
        "original_solution": "In inches, the height of the rim is 10*12 = 120 inches.\nThus, the height that the player needs to be able to reach is 120 + 6 = 126 inches.\nWithout jumping, the player can reach their height plus an additional 22 inches, or a total of 6*12 + 22 = 94 inches.\nTherefore, the player needs to jump 126 - 94 = 32 inches to reach the height required to dunk a basketball.\n#### 32",
        "original_answer": 32.0,
        "transformed_solution": "In inches, the height of the rim is 11*12 = 132 inches.\n",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 1 references 10 in the question as 11 wrongly and calculates 11*12=132 instead of 10*12=120. Its subsequent related steps, step 2 and 4, will be affected. Step 2 changes from 120+6=126 to 132+6=138, and step 4 changes from 126-94=32 to 138-94=44. Please note that you should only consider one error, so step 3 still references 6 in the question correctly.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The solution is correct. It first converts the height of the rim from feet to inches, and then subtracts the player's height and the distance they can reach above their head from the height of the rim to find the height they need to jump."

        "question": "Val has three times as many dimes as nickels. If she accidentally finds twice as many nickels as she has in her older brother's treasure box, and takes them for herself, what would be the value of money she has, in dollars, if she had 20 nickels before finding the new ones from her brother's treasure box?",
        "original_solution": "If Val currently has 20 nickels and finds twice as many nickels as she has in her older brother's treasure box, she will have 2*20=40 more nickels.\nThe total number of nickels she'll have is 40+20=60\nSince nickel is worth $0.05, the value of the nickels Val is having is 60*0.05=$3\nVal had three times as many dimes as nickels before she found the 40 new nickels, a total of 3*20=60 dimes\nSince a dime has a value of $0.10, the value of the dimes that Val has is 60*$0.10=$6\nTogether, the value of the dimes and nickels Val has is worth $6+$3=$9\n#### 9",
