A third of the rest of it will have trellises for vining plants, and the rest will be devoted to raised beds. How big will the raised bed section of the garden be?",
        "original_solution": "The garden is 220 * 120 = 26,400 square feet.\nThe tilled land will take up half the area, and the trellises and raised beds will be the other half. Each half is 26,400 / 2 = 13,200 square feet.\nThe trellises will take up 1/3 of the remaining land, so the raised beds will take 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 of the remaining land.\nSo the total area of the raised bed area will be 13,200 square feet * (2 / 3) = 8,800 square feet.\n#### 8800",

The original solution calculates the area correctly with the formula 220 * 120, but the transformed solution incorrectly calculates the perimeter with the formula 220 + 120 + 220 + 120. This confusion of formula leads to the incorrect result of 680 square feet for the perimeter instead of 26,400 square feet for the area.

So the total perimeter is (28 + 28 + 11 + 11 + 16 + 16) inches = 108 square inches. Now consider the total surface area inside the box: the two long sides and the two short sides are joined at the edges, so only half of their perimeters should be considered. So the total perimeter after accounting this is (28/2 + 28/2 + 11 + 11 + 16 + 16) inches = 72 square inches. Then calculate the area of the top and the bottom: since the area is given as 40 square inches, the length of the sides of the top and the bottom should be sqrt(40) inches. Now calculate the area of the long sides: the length of the long sides should be 72 inches minus 2 times sqrt(40) inches, so the area of the long sides is 2 * (72 inches minus 2 times sqrt(40) inches) * 6 inches = 144 square inches. Similarly, calculate the area of the short sides: the length of the short sides is 72 inches minus 2 times sqrt(40) inches, so the area of the short sides is 2 * (72 inches minus 2 times sqrt(40) inches) * 5 inches = 100 square inches.

The original solution correctly calculates the perimeter as 2 * 225 feet for the length and 2 * 125 feet for the width, resulting in 700 feet. However, the transformed solution mistakenly calculates the area by multiplying the length (225 feet) by the width (125 feet) to get 28125 square feet. This leads to the incorrect subtraction of the gate widths from the area rather than the perimeter, culminating in an erroneous transformed answer of 28112 feet.

This affects the subsequent related steps, so the calculation for the total area becomes a calculation for the total perimeter, ultimately affecting the total number of shingles needed. Note that the language description of step 1 < First find the area of one side of a roof > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. Likewise, the wrong_type should remain consistent as 'confusing_formula_error' since the formula used for calculation has been mistakenly used from the perimeter instead of the area, and it is still a single error affecting all the subsequent steps based on the area calculation.",
