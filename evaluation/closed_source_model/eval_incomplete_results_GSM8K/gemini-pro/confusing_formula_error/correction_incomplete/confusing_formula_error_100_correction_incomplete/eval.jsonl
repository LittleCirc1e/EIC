The original_solution properly calculates the volume of the rectangular prism by multiplying the side of the square base with itself and then by the height (2*2*8), but the transformed_solution incorrectly treats the calculation as if finding the perimeter of the base (2+2+2+2). By changing the formula from volume to perimeter, the result is an incorrect volume calculation, influencing the subsequent weight calculation in step 2. As a result, the original_solution's correct volume of 32 cubic meters used to find the weight (2700*32) is erroneously transformed to an incorrect volume of 8 cubic meters (2+2+2+2) and the subsequent incorrect weight (2700*8). It's important to note that only step 1 has been modified to introduce the confusing formula error, affecting the related step 2, while no language description has been changed.", "is_correct": "no", "corrected_solution": "The volume of the rectangular prism is 8 x 2 x 2 = 32 cubic meters. The weight of the statue is 32 cubic meters x 2700 kg per cubic meter = 86,400 kg.", "corrected_answer": 86400, "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly calculated the volume of the rectangular prism. The correct volume is 32 cubic meters, not 8 cubic meters."}
