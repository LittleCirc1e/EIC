        "question": "The region east of plain A is 50 square miles less than the region east of plain B. If plain B has 200 square miles, how many square miles do the plains have in total?",
        "original_solution": "The region of plain A has a total of 200 - 50 = 150 square miles.\nThe total number of square miles for both plains is 150 square miles for plain A + 200 square miles for plain B = 350 square miles\n#### 350",
        "original_answer": 350.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The region of plain A has a total of 200 - 50 = 150 square miles.\nBecause plain C also needs to be considered which is 60 square miles, the total number of square miles for all plains is 150 square miles for plain A + 200 square miles for plain B + 60 square miles for plain C = 410 square miles\n",
        "transformed_answer": 410.0,
        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "adding_irrelevant_information",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 2 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <Because plain C also needs to be considered which is 60 square miles>, resulting in step 2 changing from 150 square miles for plain A + 200 square miles for plain B = 350 square miles in the original_solution to 150 square miles for plain A + 200 square miles for plain B + 60 square miles for plain C = 410 square miles in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The solution is correct. It correctly calculates the area of plain A by subtracting 50 square miles from the area of plain B, and then adds the area of plain C to get the total area of all plains."
