        "original_solution": "His hair grew 36 inches - 6 inches = 30 inches\nHair grows at a rate of 12 months/year * 0.5 inches/month =6 inches/year\nIt took him 30 inches / 6 inches/year = 5 years to grow his hair out.\n#### 5",

        "explanation": "In the transformed_solution, the first step is altered and contains a mathematically incorrect operation. Instead of subtracting the starting length from the current length (36 inches - 6 inches), the current length is incorrectly multiplied by the number of months in a year (36 inches * 12 months/year), leading to a result of 432 inches. The transformed solution's step 1 results in an incorrect calculation that does not represent the hair growth correctly, therefore directly leading to the wrong answer that it took 72 years for Bob to grow out his hair. The sequence of steps in the transformed_solution erroneously inflated the hair growth, directly affecting the subsequent computations, which are also incorrect but follow from the initial error in step 1. The error is classified as a calculation error and wrong_step is identified as 1 because that is where the first incorrect operation occurred.",

        "original_answer": 135.0,

        "explanation": "In this case, we remove the first step from the original_solution. The original first step calculates how many peaches are fresh, based on the total count of 250 peaches, while the second step subtracts those that are too small from the fresh count. By removing the first step, we change the order of the calculations: first subtract the 15 too-small peaches from the total count, then calculate 60% of this new total. This sequence represents the transformed solution. The value changes because instead of calculating 60% of 250 and then subtracting 15, we first subtract 15 from 250 and calculate 60% of the remaining 235 peaches. Hence, the transformed_answer is 141 peaches, which is based on calculating the percent of 235 instead of 250. This error occurs in the first step of the transformed_solution because it changes the base number from which the percentage is calculated, making it the wrong step.",

        "explanation": "This example removes intermediate step 1 from the original_solution. In the original_solution, step 1 references the number 183 and 30 from the question, and step 4 references the result 5490 from step 1. Therefore, after deleting step 1, step 4 should reference the result 182 from step 2 to calculate the total miles for the rest of the days with 30 miles per day, which changes the formula from 35*182=6370 to 30*182=5460. Steps 3 and 4, as subsequent related steps, are affected by the error in step 2. Step 3 will shift from calculating the miles for the remaining days with 35 miles per day (originally from step 3 in the original solution) to 30 miles per day, resulting in 5460 miles instead of 6370. Then, step 4 will change from adding the original total of 5490+6370=11,860 to 183*30+5460=11,460.
