Since in our transformation we remove step 1, we then modify step 2 to include only one 50m trip, changing the formula from 140m - 100m = 40 meters to 140m - 50m = 90 meters. It should be noted that while the calculation itself is algebraically correct, the premise is wrong because it does not consider the entire trip. The first step (now also the wrong_step) references the correct number from the question and no intermediate steps are present, thus making the entire reasoning incorrect and leading to a different transformed answer.",

This incorrect modification affects the calculation of yellow pebbles resulting in a different answer, as the division would then include the blue pebbles in the count.
