        "question": "Lucille made an agreement with her mom that she would earn six cents for every weed she pulled in her mom's garden. There are eleven weeds in the flower bed, fourteen in the vegetable patch, and thirty-two in the grass around the fruit trees. Lucille weeded the flower bed, the vegetable patch, and half the grass before she took a break. She bought a soda for 99 cents on her break with some of her earnings. How many cents does Lucille have left?",
        "original_solution": "Lucille weeded half the grass, so she pulled 32 / 2 = 16 weeds around the fruit frees.\nShe pulled 11 + 14 + 16 = 41 weeds before her break.\nFrom that, she earned 41 * 6 = 246 cents.\nAfter buying her soda, Lucille has 246 - 99 = 147 cents left.\n#### 147",

        "explanation": "This example changes the subtraction operator to division when calculating the remaining money after buying the soda, changing 246 - 99 = 147 to 246 / 99 = 2. The original statement calculates the money left by subtracting the cost of the soda from the total earnings. By using division instead, the process implies dividing the total earnings by the cost of the soda, which generates an incorrect result for this context. The error affects only the final step, and all calculations are performed correctly by applying the changed operator. The rest of the steps before this wrong step are correctly calculated, which means their subsequent reliance on previous steps is fitting. The transformed answer of 2 is incorrect in the context of the question.",
