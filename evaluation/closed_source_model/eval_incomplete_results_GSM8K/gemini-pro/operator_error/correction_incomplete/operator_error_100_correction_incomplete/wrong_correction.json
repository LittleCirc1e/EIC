        "original_solution": "To buy 100 pencils the school needs 100 * $1.80 = $180.00.\nEach ice pop sells for $1.50 but costs $.90 to make, for a net profit of $1.50 - $.90 = $.60.\nSo in order to raise $180.00, the school will need to sell $180.00 / $.60 per ice-pop = 300 ice-pops.\n#### 300",

        "explanation": "This example changes the subtraction in step 2 into addition, modifying the net profit calculation from $1.50 - $.90 = $.60 to $1.50 + $.90 = $2.40. As a consequence, the number of ice-pops needed to raise $180.00 changes in step 3 due to the increased net profit per ice-pop, converting from $180.00 / $.60 per ice-pop = 300 ice-pops to $180.00 / $2.40 per ice-pop = 75 ice-pops. The operator in step 2 has been changed incorrectly, but the calculation following the error is correctly performed. This single error in operator leads to a transformed answer that is different from the original answer.",
