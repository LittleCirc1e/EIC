This incorrect conversion affects all the subsequent related steps, changing the amounts of snow measured in inches.

She has 240/20 = 12 units of cherries to pit\nIt takes 10 minutes to pit a unit of cherries and she has 12 units so it will take her 10*12 = 120 minutes\n60 minutes are in 1 hour and it takes her 120 minutes so that’s 120/60 = 2 hours\n#### 2",

        "explanation": "Here, step 4 contains an incorrect unit conversion, erroneously stating that 50 minutes are in an hour instead of the correct 60 minutes. This error alters the computation from 120/60 = 2 hours in the original solution to 120/50 = 2.4 hours in the transformed solution. This error affects only the related unit conversion in the final step, while previous calculations remain unaffected.",

        "original_solution": "If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12*1=12 inches=1 foot.\nSince Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, then Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4*1=4 feet.\nAnd since Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami. then Naruto can lift a mountain 10*4=40 feet.\n#### 40",

        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 12 inches is wrongly equal to 2 feet instead of 1 foot, resulting in Saskay being able to lift 12 inches = 1 foot in the original_solution becoming Saskay being able to lift 12 inches = 2 feet in the transformed_solution. This incorrect conversion impacts the subsequent related calculations for Kagiyami and Naruto, affecting steps 2 and 3. Step 2 changes from Kagiyami lifting 4*1=4 feet in the original_solution to 4*2=8 feet in the transformed_solution. Similarly, step 3 changes from Naruto lifting a mountain 10*4=40 feet to 10*8=80 feet. It should be noted that only the unit conversion error is made, without affecting the previous steps and the multiplication process itself, only the value used has changed due to the conversion error.",

Therefore, the original 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes is transformed to 2 hours * 50 minutes/hour = 100 minutes. This affected the subsequent related step 4, changing 120 minutes – 30 minutes - 15 minutes = 75 minutes to the incorrect 100 minutes – 30 minutes - 15 minutes = 55 minutes.
