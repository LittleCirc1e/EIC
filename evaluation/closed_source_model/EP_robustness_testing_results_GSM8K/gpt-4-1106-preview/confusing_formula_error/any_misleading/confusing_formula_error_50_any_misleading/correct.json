The correct calculation should be 1 case for the top level, 4 cases for the second level (2*2), 9 cases for the third level (3*3), and 16 cases for the fourth level (4*4), which adds up to 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30 cases."

        "explanation": "In this case, the confusing_formula_error occurred at step 3 where the original solution correctly uses the formula for area of a rectangle (L * W) to find the width and length (80 = L * W). The transformation incorrectly uses the perimeter formula (L + W) instead of the area formula, modifying the equation to 100 = L + W. The following steps are updated based on this error, leading to the incorrect calculation of width and length. The perimeter formula is incorrect in this context since the question specifies the area of the rectangle. The rest of the solution correctly follows the erroneous formula, resulting in the final transformed answer of 80 m for the length of the rectangle, which is different from the original answer.",

        "any_explanation": "The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width, not by adding them. The correct equation should be 100 = L * W. After substituting L with 4W, the equation becomes 100 = 4W * W or 100 = 4W^2. The student incorrectly added L and W instead of multiplying them."

        "transformed_solution": "First translate the feet to inches or 10 feet * 12 inches per foot = 120 inches.\nThen use length + width + length + width which is 120 + 120 + 120 + 120 = 480 square inches.\n#### 480",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the area of a square with its perimeter. The original solution properly calculates the area by using length * width. In the transformed solution, the formula for perimeter is mistakenly used instead, which is adding up all the sides of the square (length + width + length + width), leading to an incorrect calculation of 120 + 120 + 120 + 120 = 480 square inches for the room area. The first step of converting feet to inches is correct and therefore remains unchanged.
