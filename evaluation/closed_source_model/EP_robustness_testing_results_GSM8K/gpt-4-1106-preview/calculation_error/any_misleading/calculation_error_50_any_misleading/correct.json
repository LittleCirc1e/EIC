The correct approach is to first find the price of each shirt by dividing Jessica's total purchase of $20 by the 2 shirts she bought, which gives $10 per shirt. Then, using the correct price per shirt, calculate the total cost of shirts in Peter's purchase (5 shirts * $10 = $50) and subtract this from Peter's total ($62) to find the cost of the 2 pairs of pants. Finally, divide by 2 to find the cost of one pair of pants."
