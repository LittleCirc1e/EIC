        "question": "John had a son James when he was 19. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. How old will John's youngest son, who was born when John was 32, be in 3 years?",
        "original_solution": "Dora is 12-3=9\nSo James is 9*2=18 years old\nThat means John is 18+19=37\nJohns youngest son is 37-32=5 years old\nSo he will be 5+3=8 in 3 years\n#### 8",
        "original_answer": 8.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Dora is 12+3=15\nSo James is 15*2=30 years old\nThat means John is 30+19=49\nJohns youngest son is 49-32=17 years old\nSo he will be 17+3=20 in 3 years\n#### 20",

        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example turns the subtraction in step 1 into addition by changing - to +, turning 12-3=9 into 12+3=15. This affects the subsequent related step 2, where now James is 15*2=30 years old instead of 9*2=18. The impact further cascades to step 3 and 4, where John now is calculated to be 30+19=49, and consequently, his youngest son is 49-32=17 years old. Step 5 inherits this result, changing the youngest son's age in 3 years from 5+3=8 to 17+3=20. It should be noted that the only incorrect thing in the solution is the operator in step 1, but the calculations carried out after the change in the operator are correct, leading to a different result from the original answer.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The solution correctly follows the steps to determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years. Dora's current age is calculated correctly, which is then used to find James's age. John's age is then determined based on James's age, and subsequently, the age of John's youngest son is found. Finally, the age of the youngest son in 3 years is correctly calculated.",

        "transformed_solution": "First figure out how many square feet the original bolt of fabric was: 16 feet * 12 feet = 192 square feet\nThen figure out how much fabric Ann took for the living room curtains: 4 feet * 6 feet = 24 square feet\nThen figure out how much fabric Ann took for the bathroom curtains: 2 feet * 4 feet = 8 square feet\nFinally, subtract the square footage of both sets of curtains from the total square footage: 192 - 24 - 8 = 160 square feet\n#### 160",

If Tara wants to pay an additional $20 for the down payment, how much will her balance be after paying for 4 months?",
        "transformed_solution": "Tara has to make a $1000 x 20/100 = $200 down payment.\nSince Tara wants to pay $20 more for the down payment, her total down payment will be $200 + $20 = $220.\nSo her remaining balance payable over a year is $1000 - $220 = $780.\nTara has to make a monthly payment of $780/year / 12 months/year = $65/month.\nThe total cost of her payments for 4 months is $65/month x 4 months = $260.\nTherefore, Tara's balance after 4 months is $780 - $260 = $520.\n#### 520",

        "any_explanation": "The solution incorrectly calculates the total cost of her payments for 4 months. It should be $65/month x 4 months = $260, but since this is an installment payment, the initial down payment should not be subtracted from the total cost before calculating the monthly payments.
