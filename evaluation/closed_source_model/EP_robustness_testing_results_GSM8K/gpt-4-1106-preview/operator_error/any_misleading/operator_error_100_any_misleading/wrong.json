        "original_solution": "Emily’s hair is 20-6 = 14 inches long.\nKate's hair 14/2= 7 inches long.\n#### 7",
        "original_answer": 7.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Emily’s hair is 20+6 = 26 inches long.\nKate's hair 26/2= 13 inches long.\n#### 13",

        "explanation": "This example changes the subtraction in the original solution step 1 to addition, turning '20-6 = 14 inches' into '20+6 = 26 inches'. Subsequently, step 2, which calculates the length of Kate's hair based on the length of Emily's hair, now uses the incorrect figure from step 1 but does the calculation correctly. Thus, '14/2= 7 inches' is transformed into '26/2= 13 inches'. The transformed answer is therefore different from the original answer due to the introduced operator error in step 1.",

        "question": "On a school trip to the seashore, Alan and his friends collected shells. Alan collected four times as many shells as Ben did. Ben got a late start and only collected a third of what Laurie did. If Laurie collected 36 shells how many did Alan collect?",

        "any_explanation": "The student incorrectly divided the number of shells Laurie collected by 3 to find the number Ben collected. Since Ben collected a third of what Laurie did, the correct calculation should be 36 * 1/3. The student then correctly multiplied by 4 to find how many shells Alan collected, but because the initial number for Ben's shells was incorrect, the final answer is also incorrect."

        "transformed_solution": "Arnel shared 5 x 8 = 40 pencils with his friends.\nSo, he had 10 + 40 = 50 pencils in all.\nTherefore, each box had 50/10 = 5 pencils inside.\n#### 5",
        "label": "yes",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "any_explanation": "The student's calculation of the total number of pencils is incorrect. Arnel shared 40 pencils with his friends and kept 10 for himself, making it 50 pencils. However, these 50 pencils represent the pencils he had after removing ten boxes worth of pencils. To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils from the ten boxes. Since his friends got 8 pencils each from the shared amount, and he has 5 friends, the shared pencils are 5 friends * 8 pencils/friend = 40 pencils. Adding the 10 pencils Arnel kept, we have 40 + 10 = 50 pencils that were not in boxes. To find the number of pencils that were originally in the ten boxes, we need to add these 50 pencils to the total. Since we don't have the total number of pencils, we cannot determine the number of pencils in each box from the information provided."

The correct calculation is 3 days * (2/3) miles/day = 2 miles/day * 3 days = 6 miles, not 2 miles. Therefore, Jesse has 30 - 10 - 6 = 14 miles left to run, not 18. The average Jesse needs to run over the final three days is 14 miles / 3 days = 4.67 miles/day, not 6. Mia's calculations are correct. The average they both need to run is not simply the sum of their individual averages divided by two, but rather the sum of the miles they each need to run divided by the total number of days left and then divided by two. The correct average for both combined over the final three days is (14 miles for Jesse + 18 miles for Mia) / 3 days / 2 people = 32 miles / 3 days / 2 people = 5.33 miles/day."
