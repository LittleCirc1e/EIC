        "transformed_solution": "The cow initially weighs 400*1.5=600 pounds\nSo it gained 600 - 400 = 200 pounds\nSo its value increased by 200*$3 = $600\n#### 600",

        "any_explanation": "The student incorrectly calculated the cow's weight after gaining. The correct calculation should be 400 pounds * 1.5 = 600 pounds, which is the final weight, not the weight gained. The weight gained should be 600 - 400 = 200 pounds. The value increase should be calculated with the weight gained, so the correct calculation for the value increase is 200 pounds * $3 = $600. However, the initial statement of the cow's weight after gaining is incorrect."

        "transformed_solution": "The number of books borrowed on Friday is higher by 40 * 40/100 = 16 books.\nThere are 5 days from Monday to Friday inclusive, so Krystian borrows an average of 5 * 40 = 200 books during that time.\nWith Friday's increase in borrowings, during one week Krystian borrows 200 + 16 = 216 books.\n#### 216",

        "any_explanation": "The student incorrectly calculated the total number of books borrowed in a week. The student added the 16 extra books borrowed on Friday to the total of 200 books borrowed from Monday to Thursday, instead of calculating the number of books borrowed on Friday separately. The correct calculation should be 4 days at 40 books per day plus 1 day at 40 books plus 40% of 40 books (which is 16), so Friday's total is 56 books. The correct total for the week is 4 * 40 + 56 = 216 books."

The correct calculation should account for whether it is a leap year or not."

Half the books on the bottom section of the cart were mystery books, which she quickly put back into place. Then, she shelved the remaining books from the bottom of the cart, including 5 Western novels and 6 biographies. How many books did she have on the book cart when she started?",
        "transformed_solution": "Half of the books on the bottom section of the cart are mystery books, which means they are the same as the number of Western novels and biographies put together. So there are 5 + 6 = 11 mystery novels.\nAdd them all together, and there are 12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 11 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies = 46 books total\n#### 46",

        "is_correct": "no",
        "any_explanation": "The student incorrectly assumed that the number of mystery books is equal to the sum of Western novels and biographies. Instead, the mystery books should be double the sum of Western novels and biographies because half of the books are mystery books. Therefore, the correct number of mystery books should be (5 Western + 6 biographies) * 2 = 22 mystery books. The correct total should be 12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 22 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies = 57 books."

        "transformed_solution": "Hector gave to Alisha twice as many as he had given Todd, for a total of 4*2=8 gumballs,\nHector gave 5 less than four times as many to Bobby as he had given to Alisha, or a total of (8*4)-5=27 gumballs.\nIf Hector had 6 gumballs remaining, he originally purchased 4+8+27+6=45 gumballs.\n#### 45",

The correct total should be 4 (to Todd) + 8 (to Alisha) + 27 (to Bobby) + 6 (remaining) = 45 gumballs. However, the student's process incorrectly calculates 8*4 as 27 instead of 32, so the final answer should be 4+8+32-5+6=45."
