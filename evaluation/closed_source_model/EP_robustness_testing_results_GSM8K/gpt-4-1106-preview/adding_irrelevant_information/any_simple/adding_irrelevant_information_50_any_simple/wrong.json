        "original_solution": "The first 3 pieces each cost 45000/3=$15,000\nSo the next piece was 15,000*.5=$7,500 more expensive\nThat means it cost 15,000+7,500=$22,500\nThat means in total he spent 45,000+22,500=$67,500\n#### 67,500",

        "transformed_solution": "The first 3 pieces each cost 45000/3=$15,000\nSo the next piece was 15,000*.5=$7,500 more expensive\nBecause John also bought a frame for the more expensive piece for $1,500, that means it cost 15,000+7,500+1,500=$24,000\nThat means in total he spent 45,000+24,000=$69,000\n#### 69,000",

        "explanation": "Step 3 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <Because John also bought a frame for the more expensive piece for $1,500>, resulting in step 3 changing from 15,000+7,500=$22,500 in the original_solution to 15,000+7,500+1,500=$24,000 in the transformed_solution. The final sum in step 4 also changes as a consequence of the added cost, from 45,000+22,500=$67,500 to 45,000+24,000=$69,000. It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct.",
