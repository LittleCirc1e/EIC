The question only asks for the profit calculation based on the repairs, retail shop sales, and fixed expenses. The parking fine should not be included in the calculation.\n\nLet's recalculate the profit without the parking fine:\n\n- Profit from tire repairs: $15 profit per repair * 300 repairs = $4500\n- Profit from complex repairs: $250 profit per repair * 2 repairs = $500\n- Profit from retail shop sales: $2000\n- Total profit from all activities: $4500 (tire repairs) + $500 (complex repairs) + $2000 (retail) = $7000\n- Subtracting fixed expenses: $7000 - $4000 (rent and other fixed expenses) = $3000\n\nThe correct profit calculation should be $3000, not $2700.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'no'."
