        "original_solution": "Liam's age two years ago was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.\nVince's age two years ago was 14/2 = 7 years old because Liam's age is twice his.\nSo Vince age now is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.\n#### 9",
        "original_answer": 9.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Vince's age two years ago was 16/2 = 8 years old because Liam's age is twice his.\nSo Vince's age now is 8 + 2 = 10 years old.\n#### 10",

        "explanation": "In the original_solution, step 1 calculates Liam’s age two years ago. However, the transformed_solution removes this first step. As a consequence, step 1 in the transformed_solution, which originally is step 2 in the original_solution, directly references the number 16 from the question, which leads to Vince’s age being half of 16 instead of half of Liam’s age two years ago. This results in a transformed answer of 10, which is incorrect. The error in the new step 1 is due to the fact that it incorrectly calculates Vince’s age as half of Liam’s current age rather than half of Liam’s age two years ago. Since the original step 1 is absent, the subsequent related step (the new step 1) becomes the wrong step.",

        "original_solution": "He plays video games for 4/2=2 hours a day\nHe watches TV for 4*7=28 hours a week\nHe plays video games for 3*2=6 hours\nSo in total he spends 6+28=34 hours on those activities\n#### 34",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 has been removed. In the original_solution, step 1 references the number 4 from the question, and step 3 references the result 2 from step 1. So after deleting step 1, step 3 should change the formula from 3*2=6 hours to 3*4=12 hours, directly referencing the number 4 from the question. It should be noted that the calculation in step 2 after the transformation is still correct. The changed step 3 represents an alteration of the original step 3 in the transformed solution, so the wrong_step is 2. Since the original step 3 referred to the result of step 1, and now it refers to the number in the question due to the deletion of step 1, wrong_step is 2.",
