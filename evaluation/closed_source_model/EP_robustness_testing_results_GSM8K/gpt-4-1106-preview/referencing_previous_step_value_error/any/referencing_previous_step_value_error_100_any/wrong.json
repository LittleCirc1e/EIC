        "question": "In a factory, there are 3 machines working 23 hours a day. The owner decided to buy a fourth machine, which works only 12 hours a day. One machine can produce 2 kg of material every hour. The factory sells the produced material for $50 per 1 kg. How much can this factory earn in one day?",
        "original_solution": "The total runtime for the first three machines is 3 machines * 23 hours/day/machine = 69 hours/day.\nSo these machines could produce 69 hours/day * 2 kg/hour = 138 kg/day.\nThe fourth machine could produce 12 hours/day * 2 kg/hour = 24 kg/day of material.\nIn total all the machines would produce 138 kg/day + 24 kg/day = 162 kg/day of material.\nThe factory would therefore earn 162 kg/day * $50/kg = $8100/day.\n#### 8100",

        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references the total produced by the first three machines as 138 kg/day and the fourth machine as 20 kg/day (implicitly, since 156 - 138 = 18, which could be misconstrued as 12 hours * 1.5 kg/hour for a total of 18 kg/day) from steps 2 and 3 by changing the correct sum 138 kg/day + 24 kg/day = 162 kg/day to an incorrect sum 138 kg/day + 24 kg/day = 156 kg/day. It should be noted that steps 2 and 3 in the transformed_solution should be the same as the steps 2 and 3 in the original_solution and should have their result numbers calculated correctly. Step 5, as the subsequent step of step 4, is affected and changes the total earning from 162 kg/day * $50/kg = $8100/day to 156 kg/day * $50/kg = $7800/day. The referencing error only occurs at step 4, and thus all calculations for the other steps are still correct. The consequence of this single referencing error is that the transformed_answer changes to $7800, which is different from the original_answer of $8100.",

        "transformed_solution": "First figure out how many square feet the original bolt of fabric was: 16 feet * 12 feet = 192 square feet\nThen figure out how much fabric Ann took for the living room curtains: 4 feet * 6 feet = 24 square feet\nThen figure out how much fabric Ann took for the bathroom curtains: 2 feet * 4 feet = 8 square feet\nFinally, subtract the square footage of both sets of curtains from the total square footage: 192 - 24 - 8 = 160 square feet\n#### 160",

        "transformed_solution": "Tara has to make a $1000 x 20/100 = $200 down payment.\nSince Tara wants to pay $20 more for the down payment, her total down payment will be $200 + $20 = $220.\nSo her remaining balance payable over a year is $1000 - $220 = $780.\nTara has to make a monthly payment of $780/year / 12 months/year = $65/month.\nThe total cost of her payments for 4 months is $65/month x 4 months = $260.\nTherefore, Tara's balance after 4 months is $780 - $260 = $520.\n#### 520",
