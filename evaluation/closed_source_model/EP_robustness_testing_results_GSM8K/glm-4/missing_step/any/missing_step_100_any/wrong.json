        "explanation": "In the transformation, step 1 of the original_solution, which calculates the weight difference, was deleted. Therefore, the transformed_solution should have started with the calculation based on the 60 pounds Jack weighs. However, instead of calculating the weight difference from step 1 and dividing that by the weight of each rock, the transformed_solution incorrectly refers directly to Jack's weight. This leads to a calculation of 60 pounds divided by 4 pounds per rock, equaling 15 rocks. The correct intermediate calculation of the weight difference was not considered, resulting in the number of needed rocks being artificially increased to 15. The referenced number 60 in the transformed solution's first step, which is step 1, is the weight of Jack from the question, so the wrong_step is 1.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The calculation correctly determines that Jack needs to add 15 rocks, each weighing 4 pounds, to his side of the see-saw to balance the weights. 60 pounds (Jack's weight) minus 40 pounds (Anna's weight) equals 20 pounds. Since each rock adds 4 pounds, 20 pounds divided by 4 pounds per rock equals 5 rocks. However, the solution incorrectly states the calculation as 60 pounds divided by 4 pounds per rock, which is not the correct approach. The number of rocks should be based on the weight difference, not Jack's total weight. Despite this, the final answer of 15 rocks is correct because it would balance the see-saw if Jack adds 15 rocks to his side, making the total weight on both sides equal (60 + 15*4 = 100 pounds for Jack and 100 pounds for Anna).",
