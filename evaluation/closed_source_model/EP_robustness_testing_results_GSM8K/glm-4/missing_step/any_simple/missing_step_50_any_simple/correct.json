        "explanation": "In this example, intermediate step 2 from the original_solution has been removed, which calculated the weight of the catfish. In the original_solution, it references the result 4.5 from step 2. Step 4, the summation step, originally references all three results from steps 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, after removing step 2, step 4 in the transformed_solution needs to change from referencing result 4.5 to the number in the question it should reference, which is 8 (the weight of the trout, since 4 trout at 2 pounds each equals 8 pounds), thus changing the formula from 8 + 4.5 + 12.5 = 25 to 8 + 4.5 + 12.5 = 20.5. However, this introduces an error because the result incorrectly leaves out the weight of the catfish, which should have also been included in the calculation. It is step 2 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 4 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing incorrect numbers in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 2.",

The deleted step 1 would normally reference the numbers 5 and 4 from the question. However, since we're deleting the first step and not recalculating the number of species with the new additions, we're incorrectly using the original number of species (5). The subsequent step that originally referenced the result of step 1 now incorrectly references the original number of species (5), leading to the calculation of 5 * 6 = 30 minutes instead of the correct 9 * 6 = 54 minutes. The wrong_step is 1 because it is the first step performed in the transformed_solution, which references the incorrect number (5) instead of the new total (9).",

The calculation of step 2 after the transformation is still correct. However, it incorrectly assumes that Evan's dog weighs the same as Ivan's dog after multiplying Evan's dog's weight by 7. It is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 2 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing an incorrect number in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 1.",

Since the first step is missing, we need to adjust the final summation step (original Step 5) to compensate for this removal. The original solution went through 5 steps to show the progression of paintings from Day 1 to Day 5. By removing the first day's 2 paintings and not adjusting the final sum to account for this absence, it results in an error in calculation. Specifically, the final sum should still be 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 as in the original solution.
