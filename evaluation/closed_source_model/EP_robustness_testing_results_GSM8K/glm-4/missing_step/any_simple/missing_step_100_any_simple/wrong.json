The original step 1 references number 20 from the question to calculate the number of tanks and step 2 references the result from step 1 to calculate the total. After deleting step 1, reference to the number of tanks is replaced by the direct calculation of 5 times the number of trucks (5*20) in the formula for the total number of trucks and tanks. This results in a single formula that serves as step 1 for the calculation: 5*20+20 = 120. The transformed solution does not have the wrong intermediate step, and hence wrong_step is 1 since it's the first step in the transformed_solution that has an error, being the step that references the result of the deleted step. The result of the total calculation is different from the original answer, ensuring that the transformed_answer is 120, not 140, which is also a logic error in the original_solution since the correct total is in fact 120.",

Similarly, the final step, which calculates the sum of the sentences, shifts from referencing 12 years for arson to directly referencing the arithmetic producing 12 years, effectively changing 12 years to 6 years/count * 2 counts.
