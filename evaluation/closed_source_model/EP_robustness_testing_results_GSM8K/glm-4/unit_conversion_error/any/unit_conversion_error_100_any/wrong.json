        "transformed_solution": "The number of books borrowed on Friday is higher by 40 * 40/100 = 16 books.\nThere are 5 days from Monday to Friday inclusive, so Krystian borrows an average of 5 * 40 = 200 books during that time.\nWith Friday's increase in borrowings, during one week Krystian borrows 200 + 16 = 216 books.\n#### 216",

If Sally makes $6 per day and Bob makes $4 per day, how much money will they both have saved for their trip after a year?",
        "transformed_solution": "Saly saves 1/2 * $6/day = $3/day.\nSince each year have 365 days, the total amount of money Sally will save in a year is $3/day * 365 days/year = $1095/year\nBob saves 1/2 * $4/day = $2/day.\nThe total amount of money Bob will have saved in a year is $2/day * 365 days/year = $730/year\nIn total, Sally and Bob would have saved $730 + $1095 = $1825\n#### 1825",

The daily savings for Sally should be $3 and for Bob should be $2, but the explanation incorrectly adds these daily amounts without dividing by 2."
