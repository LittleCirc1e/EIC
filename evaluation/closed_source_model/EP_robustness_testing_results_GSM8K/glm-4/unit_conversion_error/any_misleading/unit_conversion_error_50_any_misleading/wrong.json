        "question": "Jenna is hemming her prom dress. The dress's hem is 3 feet long. Each stitch Jenna makes is 1/4 inch long. If Jenna makes 24 stitches per minute, how many minutes does it take Jenna to hem her dress?",
        "original_solution": "First find how many inches the hem is by multiplying the length in feet by the number of inches per foot: 3 feet * 12 inches/foot = 36 inches\nThen divide the length in inches by the length of each stitch to find how many stitches Jenna makes: 36 inches / .25 inches = 144 stitches\nThen divide the number of stitches by Jenna's stitching rate to find how long it takes her: 144 stitches / 24 stitches/minute = 6 minutes\n#### 6",

And it affects the subsequent related step 2 and 3, which change from 36 inches / .25 inches = 144 stitches to 30 inches / .25 inches = 120 stitches and 144 stitches / 24 stitches/minute = 6 minutes to 120 stitches / 24 stitches/minute = 5 minutes, respectively.
