        "original_solution": "Jessica will drive 20 minutes, twice every school day (to and from school), so 20 minutes x 2 trips = 40 minutes each day.\nThere are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so 50 hours of driving x 60 minutes/hour = 3000 minutes.\nIf you take the 3000 minutes she needs to drive / 40 minutes driving each day = 75 school days to drive 50 hours.\n#### 75",

        "explanation": "Here, steps 4 and 5 make multiple incorrect unit conversions, which results in multiple errors in subsequent calculations. The 1-hour break is increased from 10 minutes to 15 minutes, altering the total additional minutes for breaks from 120 minutes to 180 minutes. The snack breaks also change from 10 minutes each to 15 minutes each, altering the total additional minutes for snack breaks from 30 minutes to 45 minutes. Finally, the minute-to-hour conversion rate is also altered incorrectly from 60 minutes per hour to 50 minutes per hour. These changes lead to a modification of the total study and break hours required, changing the end result from the original answer of 4 days to the transformed answer of 5 days. The explanation should pinpoint the incorrect minute-to-hour conversion rate as this is the fundamental error introduced.",
