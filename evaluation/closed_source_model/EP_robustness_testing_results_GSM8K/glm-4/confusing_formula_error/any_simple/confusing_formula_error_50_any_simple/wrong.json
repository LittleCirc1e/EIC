        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the correct approach to find twice the height with an incorrect approach that would add the width back twice instead of subtracting it to find the perimeter, creating an erroneous solution. The question requires that twice the height be found by subtracting the total width of both sides from the perimeter, resulting in 30 inches - 2 * 4 inches in the original_solution, which has been incorrectly transformed into 30 inches - 4 inches + 4 inches in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 2, changing from 22 inches / 2 to 30 inches / 2 to find the height, and ultimately, the step 3, changing from the correct area of 4 inches * 11 inches to an incorrect area of 15 inches * 4 inches. Note that the language description of each step in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should also be noted that only one step has the confusing formula error, while the formulas for other steps are correct, and the transformed_answer is different from the original_answer.",

The question requires calculating the area of the square rooms which is side length multiplied by side length, rather than the sum of all sides of the square which equals its perimeter.

The subsequent steps that depend on the area of the bedrooms are affected, altering the calculations in step 2 from 121 * 4 = 484 square feet to 44 * 4 = 176 square feet and consequently the rest of the calculation leading up to the kitchen area from 530/2 = 265 to 838/2 = 419 square feet.
