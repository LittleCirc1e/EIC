Jack removes a number of marbles equal to double the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. How many marbles are left in the box?",
        "original_solution": "20 of 50 marbles are white so there are 50-20 = 30 red and blue marbles\nThe number of red marbles and blue marbles is the same, so there are 30/2 = 15 of each color\nThe difference between the number of white marbles and blue marbles is 20-15 = 5\nDouble the difference is 5*2 = 10 marbles\n10 marbles are removed to leave 50-10 = 40 marbles\n#### 40",

It should be noted that step 3 in the transformed_solution <The difference between the number of white marbles and blue marbles is 20-15 = 5> should be the same as the step 3 in the original_solution <The difference between the number of white marbles and blue marbles is 20-15 = 5> and calculates its result 5 correctly. Step 4 is affected by the erroneous referencing and changes 5*2 = 10 to 5*2 = 16. The subsequent step 5, which is the only step affected by step 4, correctly calculates the new number of marbles left as 50-16 = 34. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all steps is still correct.",

The subsequent steps 6, 7, and 8 are affected by this error and calculate new and erroneous values for B, David, and Lily, but still follow the correct calculation process based on the incorrect value.
