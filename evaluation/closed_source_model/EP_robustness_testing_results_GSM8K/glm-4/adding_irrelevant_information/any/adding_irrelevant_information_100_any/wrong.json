        "question": "Nancy, the librarian, is shelving books from the cart. She shelved 12 history books, 8 romance books, and 4 poetry books from the top section of the cart. Half the books on the bottom section of the cart were mystery books, which she quickly put back into place. Then, she shelved the remaining books from the bottom of the cart, including 5 Western novels and 6 biographies. How many books did she have on the book cart when she started?",
        "original_solution": "Half of the books on the bottom section of the cart are mystery books, which means they are the same as the number of Western novels and biographies put together. So there are 5 + 6 = 11 mystery novels.\nAdd them all together, and there are 12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 11 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies = 46 books total\n#### 46",
        "original_answer": 46.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Half of the books on the bottom section of the cart are mystery books, which means they are the same number as the sum of Western novels, biographies, and an additional 3 literature textbooks that Nancy forgot to count initially. So there are 5 Western novels + 6 biographies + 3 literature textbooks = 14 books that are not mystery novels.\nThe mystery books are the same amount, so there are also 14 mystery novels.\nTo find the total, we sum up all the categories: 12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 14 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies + 3 literature = 52 books total\n#### 52",

        "explanation": "The modified step 1 adds information that is not mentioned in the original question statement <and an additional 3 literature textbooks that Nancy forgot to count initially>, resulting in the transformation of the step from \"5 + 6 = 11 mystery novels\" in the original_solution to \"5 Western novels + 6 biographies + 3 literature textbooks = 14 books that are not mystery novels\" in the transformed_solution. This affects the following summation step, changing the total from \"12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 11 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies = 46 books\" to \"12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 14 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies + 3 literature = 52 books\".

        "transformed_solution": "First figure out how many square feet the original bolt of fabric was: 16 feet * 12 feet = 192 square feet\nThen figure out how much fabric Ann took for the living room curtains: 4 feet * 6 feet = 24 square feet\nThen figure out how much fabric Ann took for the bathroom curtains: 2 feet * 4 feet = 8 square feet\nFinally, subtract the square footage of both sets of curtains from the total square footage: 192 - 24 - 8 = 160 square feet\n#### 160",

Salmon made up half of the remaining weight it had needed to gain. How many pounds did it gain eating small animals?",
        "transformed_solution": "The bear gained 1 / 5 * 1000 = 200 pounds from berries.\nIt gained 2 * 200 = 400 pounds from acorns.\nIt still needed 1000 - 200 - 400 = 400 pounds.\nThus, it gained 400 / 2 = 200 pounds from salmon.\nTherefore, the bear gained 400 - 200 = 200 pounds from small animals.\n#### 200",

        "transformed_solution": "Tara has to make a $1000 x 20/100 = $200 down payment.\nSince Tara wants to pay $20 more for the down payment, her total down payment will be $200 + $20 = $220.\nSo her remaining balance payable over a year is $1000 - $220 = $780.\nTara has to make a monthly payment of $780/year / 12 months/year = $65/month.\nThe total cost of her payments for 4 months is $65/month x 4 months = $260.\nTherefore, Tara's balance after 4 months is $780 - $260 = $520.\n#### 520",

However, the balance after 4 months should be the remaining balance after subtracting the down payment and the 4 monthly payments from the original price of the laptop, which is $1000 - $220 - $260 = $520, not $780 - $260 as stated in the solution."
