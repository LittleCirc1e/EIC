        "explanation": "This example changes the multiplication in step 1 to addition, turning 4 x 2 = 8 pounds into 4 + 2 = 6 pounds of feed consumed by one pig a day. This affects the subsequent related step 2, step 3, and step 4. Step 2 changes from 8 x 5 = 40 pounds to 6 x 5 = 30 pounds, step 3 changes from 40 x 7 = 280 pounds to 30 x 7 = 210 pounds, and step 4 changes from 300 - 280 = 20 pounds to 300 - 210 = 90 pounds of feed left. It should be noted that only the operator in step 1 is incorrect, and its calculation after the operator change is correct. This leads to a different result in step 1, which affects the subsequent steps that use the result of step 1, but all calculations in the affected steps are correct.",

The subsequent step that calculates the cost per person now uses the transformed total cost to give a new answer of $2400 / 8 = $300 instead of the original $500.
