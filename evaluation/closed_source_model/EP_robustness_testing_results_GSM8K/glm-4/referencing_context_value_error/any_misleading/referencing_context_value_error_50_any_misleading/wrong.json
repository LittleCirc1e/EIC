        "original_solution": "Brooke will take 15 x 2 = 30 minutes to answer all math problems.\nIt will take him 6 x 30 seconds = 180 seconds to answer all social studies problems.\nIn minutes, this is equal to 180/60 = 3 minutes.\nIt will take him 10 x 1.5 minutes = 15 minutes to answer all science problems.\nTherefore, Brooke will take 30 + 3 + 15 = 48 minutes to finish his homework.\n#### 48",
