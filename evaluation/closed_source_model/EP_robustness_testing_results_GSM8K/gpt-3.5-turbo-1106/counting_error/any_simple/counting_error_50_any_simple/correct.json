        "original_solution": "The total distance covered from Monday to Wednesday is 12 + 18 + 21 = 51 miles.\nSo the average distance traveled per day is 51/3 = 17 miles.\n#### 17",

        "transformed_solution": "The total distance covered from Monday to Wednesday is 12 + 18 + 21 = 51 miles.\nThe average distance traveled per day is counted as 51/2 = 25.5 miles because Wednesday is mistakenly excluded.\n#### 25.5",
