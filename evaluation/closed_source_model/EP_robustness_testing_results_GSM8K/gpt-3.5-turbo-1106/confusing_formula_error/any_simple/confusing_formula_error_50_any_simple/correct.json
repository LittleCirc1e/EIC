Each half is 26,400 / 2 = 13,200 square feet.\nThe trellises will take up 1/3 of the remaining land, so the raised beds will take 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 of the remaining land.\nSo the total area of the raised bed area will be 13,200 square feet * (2 / 3) = 8,800 square feet.\n#### 8800",

The question asks for the area, which should be calculated by multiplying the length by the width (original_solution step 2: 7 inches * 28 inches = 196 square inches). Instead, the formula used in the transformed_solution is for the perimeter, summing up all four sides of the rectangle (transformed_solution step 2: 7 inches + 7 inches + 28 inches + 28 inches = 70 inches), which results in a different calculation. The description of the process in step 2 remains language-wise identical to the original_solution, but the mathematical formula has been altered incorrectly. The subsequent answer in transformed_solution is affected by this error (70 instead of 196), while keeping earlier steps correct.",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and area of rectangle. The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width, which gives the total area available for the trees: 4 miles * 6 miles = 24 square miles in the original_solution. However, step 1 of the transformed_solution mistakenly uses the formula for calculating the perimeter of the rectangle: 4 miles + 4 miles + 6 miles + 6 miles = 20 square miles. This results in the total number of trees being recalculated in step 2, changing from 600 trees/square mile * 24 square miles = 14400 trees to 600 trees/square mile * 20 square miles = 12000 trees in the transformed_solution.
