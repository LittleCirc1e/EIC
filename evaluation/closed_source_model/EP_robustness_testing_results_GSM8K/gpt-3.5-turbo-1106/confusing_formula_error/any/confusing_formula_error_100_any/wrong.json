        "original_solution": "First convert the length of the mural to inches: 15 feet * 12 inches/foot = 180 inches\nThen convert the height of the mural to inches: 10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches\nThen multiply the length and the height to find the total area of the mural: 180 inches * 120 inches = 21600 square inches. Since each tile is 1 square inch, this is also the number of tiles she needs.\n#### 21600",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the area and perimeter calculations. The question requires finding the area by multiplying the length by the height, rather than adding them which would calculate perimeter. This results in transforming the correct formula '180 inches * 120 inches = 21600 square inches' from the original_solution into the incorrect '180 inches + 120 inches = 300 inches' for the transformed_solution. The language description 'Then multiply the length and the height to find the total area of the mural' in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution despite the formula being incorrectly changed to reflect perimeter calculation. The subsequent step is affected as it incorrectly assumes 300 inches is the number of tiles needed. Other previous steps and language descriptions remain the same since only one step has been transformed and it is the first error in the sequence.",

        "question": "John carves a giant marble rectangular prism 8 meters tall with a 2-meter square base. It has a density of 2700 kg per cubic meter. How much does it weigh?",
        "original_solution": "The marble statue has a volume of 2*2*8=32 cubic meters\nSo that means it has a weight of 2700*32=86,400 kg\n#### 86,400",
        "original_answer": 86400.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The marble statue has a volume of 2+2+2+2=8 cubic meters\nSo that means it has a weight of 2700*8=21,600 kg\n#### 21,600",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and volume calculations. The original_solution properly calculates the volume of the rectangular prism by multiplying the side of the square base with itself and then by the height (2*2*8), but the transformed_solution incorrectly treats the calculation as if finding the perimeter of the base (2+2+2+2). By changing the formula from volume to perimeter, the result is an incorrect volume calculation, influencing the subsequent weight calculation in step 2. As a result, the original_solution's correct volume of 32 cubic meters used to find the weight (2700*32) is erroneously transformed to an incorrect volume of 8 cubic meters (2+2+2+2) and the subsequent incorrect weight (2700*8). It's important to note that only step 1 has been modified to introduce the confusing formula error, affecting the related step 2, while no language description has been changed.",

        "transformed_solution": "First figure out how many square feet the original bolt of fabric was: 16 feet * 12 feet = 192 square feet\nThen figure out how much fabric Ann took for the living room curtains: 4 feet * 6 feet = 24 square feet\nThen figure out how much fabric Ann took for the bathroom curtains: 2 feet * 4 feet = 8 square feet\nFinally, subtract the square footage of both sets of curtains from the total square footage: 192 - 24 - 8 = 160 square feet\n#### 160",
