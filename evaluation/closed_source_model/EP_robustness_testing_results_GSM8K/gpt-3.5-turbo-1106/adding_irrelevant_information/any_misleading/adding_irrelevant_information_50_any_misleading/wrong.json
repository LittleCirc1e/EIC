        "original_solution": "She strength trains 3*1=3 hours a week\nShe does boxing training 4*1.5=6 hours a week\nSo she trains a total of 3+6=9 hours a week\n#### 9",
        "original_answer": 9.0,
        "transformed_solution": "She strength trains 3*1=3 hours a week\nBecause Kat also spends an additional 0.5 hours on stretching after each strength training, her total strength training time is 3+(3*0.5)=4.5 hours a week\nShe does boxing training 4*1.5=6 hours a week\nSo she trains a total of 4.5+6=10.5 hours a week\n#### 10.5",

The statement has been modified to include this additional half an hour per strength training session, which affects her total weekly training hours in step 4, changing from a total of 3+6=9 hours a week to 4.5+6=10.5 hours a week.

The sentence <Chris buys 48 golf balls> in the original_solution has been altered to <Chris buys 48 + 12 = 60 golf balls> in the transformed_solution.
