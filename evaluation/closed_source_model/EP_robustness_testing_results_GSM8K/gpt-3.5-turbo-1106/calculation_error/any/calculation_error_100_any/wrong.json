This is the first and only modification step, resulting in the remaining steps staying the same. Since the postal requirements for the electric bill have not changed, inserting the error at this final juncture ensures that previous calculations remain unaltered and only the affected step is changed, resulting in a different transformed_answer compared to the original_answer.",
