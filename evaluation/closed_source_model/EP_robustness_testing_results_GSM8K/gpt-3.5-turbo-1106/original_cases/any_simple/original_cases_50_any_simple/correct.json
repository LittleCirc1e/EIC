However, she was only able to do 19 situps on Tuesday. How many situps would Shawna have to do on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal and make up for the ones she didn't do?",
        "transformed_solution": "On Monday, Shawna was short of 30 - 12 = 18 situps\nOn Tuesday, Shawna was short of 30 - 19 = 11 situps\nOn Wednesday, Shawna would have to do 30 + 18 + 11 = 59 situps\n#### 59",
