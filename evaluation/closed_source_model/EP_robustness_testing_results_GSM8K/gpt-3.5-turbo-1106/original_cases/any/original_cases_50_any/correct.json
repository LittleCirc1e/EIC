        "transformed_solution": "First figure out how many square feet the original bolt of fabric was: 16 feet * 12 feet = 192 square feet\nThen figure out how much fabric Ann took for the living room curtains: 4 feet * 6 feet = 24 square feet\nThen figure out how much fabric Ann took for the bathroom curtains: 2 feet * 4 feet = 8 square feet\nFinally, subtract the square footage of both sets of curtains from the total square footage: 192 - 24 - 8 = 160 square feet\n#### 160",

How many kilograms of butter are left after making those three kinds of cookies?",
        "transformed_solution": "Liza used 10/2 = 5 kilograms of butter for the chocolate chip cookies.\nThen, she used 10/5 = 2 kilograms of butter for the peanut butter cookies.\nShe used 5 + 2 = 7 kilograms of butter for the chocolate and peanut butter cookies.\nSo, only 10 -7 = 3 kilograms of butter was left.\nThen, Liza used 3/3 = 1 kilograms of butter for the sugar cookies.\nTherefore, only 3-1 = 2 kilograms of butter were left.\n#### 2",

If each game lasts for 2 hours, how many hours will Jerry spend at the field watching his daughters play and practice altogether?",
