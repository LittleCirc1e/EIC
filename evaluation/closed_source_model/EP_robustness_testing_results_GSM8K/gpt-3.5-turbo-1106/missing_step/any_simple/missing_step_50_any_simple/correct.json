By removing the first day's 2 paintings and not adjusting the final sum to account for this absence, it results in an error in calculation. Specifically, the final sum should still be 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 as in the original solution. However, in the transformed step, the summation incorrectly doubles the calculated total to 124, which becomes the transformed_answer. Therefore, the wrong_step is the last remaining one (number 5 in the sequence of steps that have not been deleted), as it improperly adjusts for the missing step and incorrectly doubles the total count, showing a calculation error.",
