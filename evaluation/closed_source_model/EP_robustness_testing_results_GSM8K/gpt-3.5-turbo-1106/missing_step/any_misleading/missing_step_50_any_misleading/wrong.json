Step 2 references the result of step 1. After deleting step 1, the subsequent step should reference the initial number in the question related to the number of seats, which is 60,000. However, the subsequent step incorrectly maintains the calculation to account for the fans that stayed home and subtracts 5,000 directly from 60,000 instead of correctly subtracting it from the actual number of seats sold. As a result, the solution skips the calculation of the number of seats sold at 75% and incorrectly presents the formula as 60,000-5,000=55,000.

Therefore, after deleting step 1, step 3 in the new solution should reference the result of step 2 directly and ignore the information about the ukuleles.
