The subsequent steps 6, 7, and 8 are affected by this error and calculate new and erroneous values for B, David, and Lily, but still follow the correct calculation process based on the incorrect value. It should be noted that step 3 in the transformed_solution <B + B/2 + 7 = 43> is the point where the referencing error occurs, while the equivalent step 3 in the original_solution <B + B + 7 = 43> and its result 2B = 36 should remain unchanged, ensuring the error occurs only at the point of reference and that all calculations following the erroneous reference are internally consistent and correct.",

One machine can produce 2 kg of material every hour. The factory sells the produced material for $50 per 1 kg. How much can this factory earn in one day?",

        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references the total produced by the first three machines as 138 kg/day and the fourth machine as 20 kg/day (implicitly, since 156 - 138 = 18, which could be misconstrued as 12 hours * 1.5 kg/hour for a total of 18 kg/day) from steps 2 and 3 by changing the correct sum 138 kg/day + 24 kg/day = 162 kg/day to an incorrect sum 138 kg/day + 24 kg/day = 156 kg/day. It should be noted that steps 2 and 3 in the transformed_solution should be the same as the steps 2 and 3 in the original_solution and should have their result numbers calculated correctly. Step 5, as the subsequent step of step 4, is affected and changes the total earning from 162 kg/day * $50/kg = $8100/day to 156 kg/day * $50/kg = $7800/day. The referencing error only occurs at step 4, and thus all calculations for the other steps are still correct. The consequence of this single referencing error is that the transformed_answer changes to $7800, which is different from the original_answer of $8100.",
