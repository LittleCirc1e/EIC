        "transformed_solution": "Jerry will spend 8 games x 2 hours per game = 16 hours watching one daughter play her games.\nHe will spend 16 x 2 = 32 hours watching both daughters play their games.\nHe will spend 8 games x 4 hours of practice = 32 hours watching one daughter practice.\nHe will spend 32 x 2 = 64 hours watching both daughters practice.\nHe will spend a total of 32 hours watching games + 64 hours watching practice = 96 hours.\n#### 96",

        "any_explanation": "The solution is incorrect because it double counts the time spent watching both daughters play their games and practice. The correct calculation should be 16 hours watching one daughter play her games + 16 hours watching the other daughter play her games + 32 hours watching one daughter practice + 32 hours watching the other daughter practice = 96 hours."

        "transformed_solution": "Paityn has a total of 20 hats + 24 hats = 44 hats.\nThe number of red hats that Zola has is 4/5 * 20 hats = 16 hats\nZola also has 2 * 24 hats = 48 blue hats.\nZola has a total of 48 hats + 16 hats = 64 hats.\nWhen they combine their hats, they have 64 hats + 44 hats = 108 hats\nIf they share the hats equally, each get 108 hats / 2 people = 54 hats/person\n#### 54",
