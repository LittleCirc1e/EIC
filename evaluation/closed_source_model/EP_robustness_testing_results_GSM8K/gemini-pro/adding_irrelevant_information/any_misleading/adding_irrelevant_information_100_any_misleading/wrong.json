        "question": "Alice has 20 quarters. She wants to exchange them for nickels and so she goes to the bank. After getting back from the bank, she discovers that 20% of the nickels are iron nickels worth $3 each. What is the total value of her money now?",
        "transformed_solution": "A quarter is worth five nickels because .25 / .05 = 5\nShe gets 100 nickels from the bank because 20 x 5 = 100\n20 of the nickels are iron nickels because 100 x .20 = 20\n80 of the nickels are regular because 100 - 20 = 80\nThe iron nickels are worth $60 because 20 x 3 = 60\nThe regular nickels are worth $4 because 80 x .05 = 4\nHer money is now worth $64 because 60 + 4 = 64\n#### 64",

        "any_explanation": "The student's solution contains several errors:\n1. The student incorrectly assumes that a quarter is worth five nickels. A quarter is actually worth twenty-five nickels.\n2. The student incorrectly calculates the number of nickels Alice receives from the bank. Alice receives 100 quarters, not 100 nickels.\n3. The student incorrectly calculates the number of iron nickels Alice receives. Alice receives 20 iron nickels, not 20% of the nickels.\n4. The student incorrectly calculates the value of the iron nickels. The iron nickels are worth $60, not $3 each.\n5. The student incorrectly calculates the value of the regular nickels. The regular nickels are worth $5, not $4.\n6. The student incorrectly calculates the total value of Alice's money. Her money is worth $115, not $64."
