        "explanation": "Step 5 mistakenly references the number of slices that Rebecca and her husband ate on Sunday night. Instead of eating 1 slice each which would be 2 slices total, the mistaken transformation assumes they ate a total of 3 slices. The modified step shows 7-3 = 4 slices remaining instead of 7-2 = 5 slices. It should be noted that the original steps leading to the number of remaining slices should remain the same, specifically step 4 in the transformed solution <There were 14 slices and her family and friends ate 7 slices so that leaves 14-7 = 7 slices> should match the original solution step. All subsequent steps properly reference the erroneous number from the previous step, such that the calculations are correct given the new, though incorrect, premise.",
