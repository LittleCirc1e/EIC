However, this is incorrect because Shawna only needs to make up for the situps she didn't do on Monday and Tuesday, not add them to her goal. To find the correct number of situps Shawna would have to do on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of situps she did on Monday and Tuesday from her goal of 30 situps."
