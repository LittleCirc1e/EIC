        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, the error occurs at step 3 where the formula for the area of a square is wrongly replaced with the formula for the perimeter of a square. This results in calculating the perimeter for the third level (3+3+3+3 cases) instead of the area (3 cases * 3 cases). Consequently, this affects the final step, changing the correct total number of cases from 30 to an incorrect total of 33 cases.
