        "question": "Find the probability that a non leap year selected at random will have 53 Sundays",
        "original_solution": "In a non leap year, there are 365 days\nThe total number of weeks in a non-leap year is 52\nIf there are 53 Sundays, it means there is an extra day in that year\nThe probability of selecting a non leap year with 53 Sundays is 1/7\n#### 1/7",
        "original_answer": "1/7",
        "transformed_solution": "In a non leap year, there are 365 days\nThe total number of weeks in a non-leap year is 52\nIf there are 53 Sundays, it means there is an extra day that could potentially fall on a Sunday\nThe probability of selecting a non leap year with 53 Sundays is 2/7\n#### 2/7",
        "transformed_answer": "2/7",
        "wrong_step": 4,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 4 erroneously calculates the probability of having 53 Sundays in a non-leap year as 2/7 instead of 1/7. Since there are 365 days in a non-leap year and 52 full weeks account for 364 days, there is 1 extra day, not 2 as implied by the transformed solution. This extra day has a 1/7 chance of being a Sunday, not 2/7. To generate the transformed_solution, the counting of weeks is kept correct, but the probability calculation is erroneously changed which is reflected in the transformed_answer.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "corrected_solution": "none",
        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the probability of a non-leap year having 53 Sundays. There are 52 weeks in a year, which accounts for 52 Sundays. The remaining day can fall on a Sunday with a probability of 1 out of the 7 days of the week, thus the probability is 1/7. However, since the question asks for the probability of a year having 53 Sundays, we must consider both the last day of the year falling on a Sunday and the first day of the year falling on a Sunday, which doubles the probability to 2/7. The solution's final answer of 2/7 is correct."

        "question": "At Chennai it rained as much on Tuesday as on all the others days of the week combined. If the average rainfall for the whole week was 3cm. How much did it rain on Tuesday?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the amount of rain on Tuesday\nTotal rainfall for the week = 7 * 3 = 21 cm\nTotal rainfall for Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday = 21 - x\nSince it rained as much on Tuesday as on all the others days combined: x = 21 - x\n2x = 21\nx = 10.5\n#### 10.5",
        "original_answer": 10.5,
        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the amount of rain on Tuesday\nTotal rainfall for the week = 6 * 3 = 18 cm\nTotal rainfall for Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday = 18 - x\nSince it rained as much on Tuesday as on all the others days combined: x = 18 - x\n2x = 18\nx = 9\n#### 9",
        "transformed_answer": 9,
        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In step 2 of the original_solution, the total days are erroneously counted as 6 instead of 7 when calculating the total rainfall for the week. This affects the following steps since the total rainfall is now incorrectly set to 18 cm instead of 21 cm. Consequently, the calculation is based on the wrong total, which also changes the final answer for Tuesdayâ€™s rainfall from 10.5 cm to 9 cm.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "corrected_solution": "none",
        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly sets up the equation to represent the total rainfall for the week and the rainfall on the other days. It correctly solves for x, which represents the rainfall on Tuesday. The calculation of 2x = 18 and x = 9 is accurate, given the information provided in the question."
