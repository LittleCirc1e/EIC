        "explanation": "Here, a single arithmetic error is introduced in step 7 of the original_solution with the incorrect division by 2, giving x = 4. This error wrongly changes the conclusion that Bill ran 6 miles on Sunday to claiming he ran 8 miles on Sunday in the transformed_solution.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Let x be the number of miles bill ran on Saturday\nOn Sunday, Bill ran x + 4 miles\nJulia ran 2*(x+4) = 2x + 8 miles on Sunday\nThe total number of miles ran on Saturday and Sunday is x + (x+4) + (2x+8) = 20\nCombining like terms, 4x + 12 = 20\nSubtracting 12 from both sides gives 4x = 8\nDividing both sides by 4 gives x = 2\nSo, Bill ran x + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6 miles on Sunday\n#### 6",
        "corrected_answer": 6.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "Step 7 makes a mistake in the final calculation by dividing both sides by 2 instead of 4, which results in x = 4 instead of the correct x = 2. This then leads to the incorrect calculation of the number of miles Bill ran on Sunday, giving 8 miles instead of the correct 6 miles."

        "question": "Gary’s gas station serves an average of 16 cars per hour on Saturdays, 10 cars per hour on Sundays, and 9 cars per hour on all other days of the week. If the station is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, how many cars does Gary’s station serve over the course of a typical week?",
        "original_solution": "On Saturdays, the station is open for 16 hours, so it serves 16 * 16 = 256 cars\nOn Sundays, the station is open for 16 hours, so it serves 16 * 10 = 160 cars\nFrom Monday to Friday, the station is open for (16 * 5) = 80 hours, so it serves 80 * 9 = 720 cars\nThe total number of cars served over the course of a typical week is 256 + 160 + 720 = 1136 cars\n#### 1136",

        "transformed_solution": "On Saturdays, the station is open for 16 hours, so it serves 16 * 16 = 256 cars\nOn Sundays, the station is open for 16 hours, so it serves 16 * 10 = 160 cars\nFrom Monday to Friday, the station is open for (15 * 5) = 75 hours, so it serves 75 * 9 = 675 cars\nThe total number of cars served over the course of a typical week is 256 + 160 + 675 = 1091 cars\n#### 1091",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 3 erroneously counts the number of hours the station is open from Monday to Friday as 15 hours per day instead of the correct 16 hours. This changes the calculation from (16 * 5) = 80 hours to (15 * 5) = 75 hours, and subsequently, the total number of cars served from Monday to Friday changes from 80 * 9 = 720 cars to 75 * 9 = 675 cars. The final step summing up the total number of cars served during the week is then affected, with the original 256 + 160 + 720 changing to 256 + 160 + 675, resulting in a different total of 1091 cars. The previous and unrelated steps remain unaffected and correct.",

It should be 16 hours per day (from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.) for 5 days, which is 16 * 5 = 80 hours, not 15 * 5 = 75 hours. The correct calculation for cars served from Monday to Friday is therefore 80 * 9 = 720 cars. The final total in step 4 references the incorrect value from step 3, resulting in the final incorrect answer of 1091 cars. The correct total is 256 + 160 + 720 = 1136 cars."
