The subsequent step 2 references the incorrect result from step 1, subtracting 387 from the initial stock of 1300 to get 913 books not sold instead of the correct calculation of 1300 - 422 = 878 books. The final step 3 correctly applies the percentage formula but with the incorrect number of books not sold, resulting in the final incorrect percentage of 70.231% instead of the correct percentage of 67.538%."

        "original_solution": "The total number of books sold is 50 + 82 + 60 + 48 + 40 = 280 books\nThe number of books not sold is 620 - 280 = 340 books\nThe percentage of books not sold is (340 / 620) * 100 = 54.84%\n#### 54.84%",

        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, there was a counting error introduced in the calculation of the percentage. The division by the number of days (which was 5 in reality but mistakenly counted as 4) is not relevant for the calculation of the percentage of books not sold. The incorrect transformation changed the calculation from a correct percentage to an incorrect value by dividing the percentage of books not sold by 4, which is unrelated to the number of days books were sold.",

        "corrected_answer": 45.16,
        "corrected_explanation": "Step 2 contains an arithmetic error, incorrectly calculating the total number of books sold as 280 instead of the correct sum of 340. Additionally, the final step incorrectly divides by 4, which is not necessary as the percentage is calculated based on the total number of books, not the number of days. The correct percentage is calculated by dividing the number of books not sold (280) by the total number of books (620) and then multiplying by 100."
