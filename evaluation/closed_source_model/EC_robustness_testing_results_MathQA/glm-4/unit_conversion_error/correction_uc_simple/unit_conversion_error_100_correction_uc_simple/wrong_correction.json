This means the time taken with stoppages is twice the time taken without stoppages. If the train travels for T hours without stoppages, it will travel for 2T hours with stoppages. However, since the distance is the same, the extra time taken (2T - T = T) is due to the stoppages. So, the train stops for T hours per every 2T hours of travel. Since the train travels at 250 km/h without stoppages, the time without stoppages is D/250, and with stoppages is D/125. Therefore, the train stops for (D/125 - D/250) hours per hour of travel time.
