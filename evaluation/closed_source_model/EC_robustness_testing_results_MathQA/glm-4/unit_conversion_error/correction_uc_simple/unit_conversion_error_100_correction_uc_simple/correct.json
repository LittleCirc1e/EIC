        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 4 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 minute is wrongly equal to 50 seconds instead of 60 seconds, resulting in 1/6 * 60 = 10 seconds in the original_solution becoming 1/6 * 50 = 8.33 seconds in the transformed_solution. The error only affects the unit conversion for representing minutes into seconds and does not affect the algebraic operation or the process to find t, as that remains correct.",

        "corrected_solution": "Let t be the time in minutes after the gears start rotating. After t minutes, gear p will have made 10t revolutions and gear q will have made 40t revolutions. We need to find t such that 40t = 10t + 5. Solving for t: 30t = 5, t = 5/30 = 1/6. In seconds, 1/6 minutes is 1/6 * 60 = 10 seconds.",
        "corrected_answer": "10.0",
        "corrected_explanation": "The error in the original solution is a unit conversion error. The conversion from minutes to seconds should be done by multiplying by 60, not 50. Therefore, 1/6 minutes is equal to 1/6 * 60 = 10 seconds, not 8.33 seconds."
