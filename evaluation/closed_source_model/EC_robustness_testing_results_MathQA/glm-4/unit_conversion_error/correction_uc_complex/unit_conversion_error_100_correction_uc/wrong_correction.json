This affects the calculation of the extra time taken, which should be 1/4 hours instead of 3/10 hours. Solving the equation with the correct extra time gives the usual time T as 1.75 hours or 1 hour and 45 minutes, not 9/5 hours."

Instead of using 3600 seconds which is the correct number of seconds in an hour, I used 3500 seconds, which is an incorrect unit conversion, leading to the wrong equation 1/x - 1/90 = 5/3500. This then also changes the multiplication factor in step 5, which was originally 90x(3600) and becomes 90x(3500) in the transformed_solution. As such, the right-hand side of the equation in step 6 changes due to this incorrect multiplication, and this error propagates through the following steps until the final answer, which is incorrect as well.
