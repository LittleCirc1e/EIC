        "corrected_solution": "The original area is the product of length and breadth. When both length and breadth are reduced by 20%, the new area is 80% of the original length times 80% of the original breadth, which is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 (64%) of the original area.

        "corrected_explanation": "The percentage decrease in area is calculated by determining the new area after the length and breadth have been reduced by 20%. The area is the product of length and breadth, and when both are reduced by the same percentage, the area is reduced by the square of that percentage. In this case, the decrease is (0.2)^2 = 0.04 or 4%. However, the solution provided incorrectly added percentages and included an unrelated 10% increase which does not affect the bleaching process."

Thus, it is 1 / (240%/100%) = 1 / 2.4 = 0.4167 days per unit of work. To find out how many days it will take to complete the entire work, we divide the total work by this rate: 1 / 0.4167 = 2.4 days per unit of work.

There is no mention of a break in the original question, so we will not subtract any time for a break. It takes them 24/7 hours to complete the job working together.",
        "corrected_answer": "3.43",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly accounted for a break that was not part of the original question and made an error in the combined work rate calculation. The correct combined work rate is 7/24, which means it takes 24/7 hours to complete the job. 24/7 simplifies to approximately 3.43 hours."

        "original_solution": "Let the number be x.\nTherefore, x = 6a + 3, where a is the quotient.\nThen x^2 = 36a^2 + 36a + 9 = 6(6a^2 + 6a + 1) + 3, which means when the square of the number is divided by 6, the remainder is 3.\n#### 3",
        "original_answer": 3,
        "transformed_solution": "Let the number be x, and it's given that x when divided by 6 leaves a remainder 3 and there is a penalty of 2 units for drawing numbers on the board.\nTherefore, x = 6a + 3 - 2, where a is the quotient.\nThen x^2 = (6a + 1)^2 = 36a^2 + 12a + 1 = 6(6a^2 + 2a) + 1, which means when the square of the number is divided by 6, the remainder is 1.\n#### 1",

        "explanation": "Step 1 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <and there is a penalty of 2 units for drawing numbers on the board>, resulting in step 1 changing from x = 6a + 3 in the original_solution to x = 6a + 3 - 2 in the transformed_solution. This change affects the calculation of the square of the number and thus the wrong remainder is obtained when divided by 6.

        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Let the number be x. It is given that x when divided by 6 leaves a remainder 3. So, x = 6k + 3, where k is an integer. The square of x is x^2 = (6k + 3)^2 = 36k^2 + 36k + 9. When we divide x^2 by 6, we get (36k^2 + 36k + 9) / 6 = 6k^2 + 6k + 1 with a remainder of 1, because 9 divided by 6 leaves a remainder of 3, which can be written as 6*0 + 3, and the rest of the terms are divisible by 6.",
        "corrected_answer": "1.0",
        "corrected_explanation": "The explanation provided in the solution is incorrect because it incorrectly adds a penalty of 2 units which is not part of the problem statement. The correct approach is to square the expression for x and then divide by 6 to find the remainder. The correct remainder is 1, as shown in the corrected solution."

        "question": "A bag contains 3 blue and 5 white marbles. One by one, marbles are drawn out randomly until only two are left in the bag. What is the probability that out of the two, one is white and one is blue?",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 1 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement by supposing there is an additional red marble in the bag, which changes the total number of marbles and affects the probabilities calculated. As a result, the probability calculations in the transformed_solution incorrectly account for the total number of marbles as 9 instead of 8, and thus the answer is altered from 15/28 in the original_solution to 5/12 in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that even though this change affects multiple probabilities calculated later in the solution, it originates from a single point of error in the initial assumption.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "The probability of drawing one white and one blue marble out of the two remaining can be calculated by considering all possible orders of drawing marbles until only two are left. There are two scenarios: either a blue is drawn first and then a white, or a white is drawn first and then a blue. The total number of marbles is 3 blue + 5 white = 8. The probability of drawing a blue first and then a white is (3/8) * (5/7) since after the first draw, there are 7 marbles left. Similarly, the probability of drawing a white first and then a blue is (5/8) * (3/7).",
        "corrected_answer": "0.3125",
        "corrected_explanation": "We add the probabilities of the two scenarios: (3/8) * (5/7) + (5/8) * (3/7) = 15/56 + 15/56 = 30/56 = 15/28 = 0.5357... However, we need to simplify the fraction correctly. 15/28 is not the right answer, the correct simplified fraction is 30/56 which simplifies to 5/9. The decimal equivalent of 5/9 is approximately 0.5556, but since the question asks for the probability out of the two remaining marbles, we need to consider only the cases where one is blue and one is white, which is actually 0.5 as there are two equally likely outcomes. The corrected answer should be the average of the two probabilities, which is (15/28 + 15/28) / 2 = 0.5. In decimal form, this is 0.5 or 1/2. The original solution incorrectly included a red marble that was not part of the problem and made an error in the final calculation."
