        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In the transformation process, the first step had the operator changed from subtraction to addition, turning \"0.15 * 1500 - 30\" into \"0.15 * 1500 + 30\". This affected the result in step 2, changing from \"0.25x = 225 - 30\" to \"0.25x = 225 + 30\". Consequently, step 3 changes from \"0.25x = 195\" to \"0.25x = 255\". Finally, step 4 correctly inherits this changed outcome and correctly computes the value of x as \"x = 255 / 0.25\" leading to an incorrect result of \"x = 1020\" as opposed to the correct original result of \"x = 780\". Steps after the erroneous transformation are correctly calculated based on the new information, but are logically wrong due to the wrong step.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly sets up the equation to represent the given information: 25% of x is 30 less than 15% of 1500. It then solves the equation accurately by performing the correct operations in the correct order, leading to the correct value of x, which is 1020."
