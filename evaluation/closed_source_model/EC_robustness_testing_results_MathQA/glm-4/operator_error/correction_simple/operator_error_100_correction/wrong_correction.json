The calculation within the transformed solution is performed correctly, but due to the operator change, the outcome is incorrect and affects the transformed_answer which is now different from the original_answer.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "3 ø 1 = 2 ^ 3 / 2 ^ 1 = 8 / 2 = 4\nThen, 4 ø 2 = 4 / (2 ^ 2) = 4 / 4 = 1",
        "corrected_answer": "1.0",
        "corrected_explanation": "The operation ø is defined as the division of 2 raised to the power of x by 2 raised to the power of w. In the second step of the original solution, the operation was incorrectly performed as multiplication instead of division. The corrected process performs the division correctly."
