Specifically, ((100 - 20) * (100 - 10) / 100) was changed to ((100 - 20) / (100 - 10) * 100).

        "corrected_answer": 28.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The original solution incorrectly calculates the total decrease by using a complex formula that does not properly account for the compounding effect of the two decreases. The correct approach is to add the decrease from the first year to the decrease from the second year. The first year decrease is straightforward, 20%. The second year decrease is from the new value after the first year's decrease, which is 80% of the original value, and then a 10% decrease from that is 8%. Adding these two percentages gives the correct total decrease of 28%."
