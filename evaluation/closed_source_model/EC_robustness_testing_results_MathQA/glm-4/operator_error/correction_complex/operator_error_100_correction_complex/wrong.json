        "explanation": "This example turns the addition in step 1 into subtraction, and by changing + to -, 0.5 - 0.5x + 0.2x = 0.4 becomes 0.5 - 0.5x - 0.2x = 0.4. This affects the subsequent related step 2. Step 2 now becomes incorrect because the term 0.2x should have been subtracted from -0.5x, but instead, it was mistakenly left as addition in the transformed solution. Therefore, the new equation after the incorrect transformation should have been 0.5 - 0.7x = 0.4, leading to -0.7x = -0.1 and x = -0.1/-0.7, which is approximately 0.14286. Hence, the explanation should reflect that an addition was incorrectly transformed into a subtraction in step 1, but the transformed solution did not correctly calculate the resultant change.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly sets up the equation to represent the problem. It accounts for the original 50% paint and the replacement with 20% paint, resulting in a new mixture of 40% paint intensity. The equation 0.5 - 0.5x - 0.2x = 0.4 is correctly solved to find x, the fraction of the original paint replaced. The final answer of x = 0.33333 (or approximately 1/3) is correct."

Step 3 changes from x = (140/40) * 100 to x = (140*40) / 100 and step 4 changes from x = 350 to x = 5600 / 100 which equals x = 56.
