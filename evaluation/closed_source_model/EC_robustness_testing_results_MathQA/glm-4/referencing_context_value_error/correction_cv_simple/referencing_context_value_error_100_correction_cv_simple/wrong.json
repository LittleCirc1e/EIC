        "transformed_solution": "27^y > 3^24 can be rewritten as (3^3)^y > (3^3)^7\nThis simplifies to 3^(3y) > 3^21\nTherefore, 3y > 21\nSo, y > 7\nThe smallest integer y for which 27^y > 3^24 is 8.\n#### 8",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 1 references 8 in the original solution but was modified to 7 incorrectly, leading to the comparison (3^3)^y > (3^3)^7 instead of (3^3)^y > (3^3)^8. This error cascades through the subsequent steps; however, only the originally incorrect step is modified while the subsequent steps still perform the correct calculations based on the result of the first erroneous step. The solution should end with y being greater than 7 for 27^y > 3^21, which is incorrect since the original condition was 27^y > 3^24. The smallest integer y that satisfies 27^y > 3^24 is actually 9.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "corrected_solution": "none",
        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly simplifies the original inequality by using the property of exponents that (a^b)^c = a^(b*c). It then correctly solves for y by equating the exponents and determining that y must be greater than 7 since 3y must be greater than 21. The smallest integer greater than 7 is indeed 8, thus the solution is correct."
