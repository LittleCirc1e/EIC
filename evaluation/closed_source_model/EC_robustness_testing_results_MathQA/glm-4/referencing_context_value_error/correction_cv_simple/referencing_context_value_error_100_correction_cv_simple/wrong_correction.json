        "corrected_solution": "Mindy earned 3 times as much as Mork, so Mindy's income was 3x and Mork's income was x.\nMork paid 40% in taxes, so he paid 0.4x in taxes and kept 0.6x of his income.\nMindy paid 30% in taxes, so she paid 0.3(3x) in taxes and kept 0.7(3x) of her income.\nThe total tax paid is 0.4x + 0.9x = 1.3x.\nThe total income is 3x + x = 4x.\nThe combined tax rate is (1.3x / 4x) = 0.325.\nThe combined tax rate is 32.5%",
        "corrected_answer": 0.325,
        "corrected_explanation": "The error in the original solution is a referencing context value error where the tax rate for Mindy was incorrectly stated as 25% instead of 30%. Additionally, the calculation for the total kept after taxes incorrectly added the percentages instead of the actual amounts. The corrected solution accurately calculates the taxes paid and the income kept based on the correct tax rates and then finds the combined tax rate as a proportion of the total income."
