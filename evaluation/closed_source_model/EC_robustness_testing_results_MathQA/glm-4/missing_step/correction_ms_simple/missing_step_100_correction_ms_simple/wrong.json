        "explanation": "In this example, the intermediate step 'Divide both sides by 40: x = (200/3*1)/40y' has been removed. Because the subsequent related step 'x = 5/3y' was originally referring to the result of the removed step, the subsequent steps need to refer to the result of the previous step 'Multiply both sides by 100 to get rid of the decimal: 40x = 200/3y.' However, instead of correcting the process to reflect the impact of this deletion, a wrong manipulation has been performed by multiplying both sides by 3, leading to the incorrect transformed_solution 'x*3=5y.' Consequently, the previous step's result has been misused, and a new error has been introduced, leading to the incorrect conclusion that 'The ratio of the first number to the second number is 3:5' instead of the correct '5:3.' The wrong_step is 3 since it is the first step referencing the result of the deleted step and introducing the incorrect calculation.",
