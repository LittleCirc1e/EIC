The original solution uses x = 6a + 3 to form the base equation of the number before squaring it. By deleting this, the transformed solution directly references the remainder '3' when creating the square of the number, which should result in a form of (6 + 3)^2, but incorrectly transforms it into 36+54+9, implying the number to be squared was 9 instead of 6a+3. Consequently, the final step alters the remainder incorrectly from 3 to 9 when the number is squared.

Then, we account for the extra bananas given out due to the absence of 390 children, which is 390 * 2. This makes the total number of bananas distributed 2x + 780. Since each child got two extra bananas, the total bananas distributed is also equal to x * 4.

Since step 1 often references a concept or introduces a variable and doesn't involve calculations, deleting it should not affect subsequent steps' calculations. The subsequent steps originally referencing result x should not change. However, the calculation to find the greatest number x has been modified to involve finding the GCD of the differences between given numbers, instead of the GCD of numbers themselves, based on the property that if numbers leave the same remainder when divided by x, their differences also should be divisible by x. Thus, we calculate the GCD of (62-25), (105-62), and (105-25) instead, which results in a GCD of 37. This is a logical modification of the solution rather than an erroneous step.

By calculating the differences between the numbers and their remainders, we get (25 - 0), (62 - 0), (105 - 0) because the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself. The GCD of 25, 62, and 105 is 1, which means there is no common divisor other than 1 that leaves the same remainder when dividing these numbers. However, since we are looking for the greatest number, we need to find the greatest common divisor of the differences between the numbers and the remainders, which in this case is the remainder itself. Since the remainder is 0 for all cases, the GCD is the smallest of the differences, which is 25. But since 25 is not a divisor of 62 and 105, we need to find the GCD of the actual remainders, which is 5, because 5 is the largest number that can divide into 25, 62, and 105 and leave the same remainder in each case."

Since he already has 30 men, he needs to employ approximately 4 - 30 = -26 men, which is not possible. The error is in the calculation of the required rate. The engineer actually needs to increase the rate to finish on time, not decrease it. The correct calculation should be: To finish 8 km in 40 days, the required rate is 8 km / 40 days = 0.2 km/day.

After deleting this intermediate step, step 3, which originally referenced step 2, must directly reference the result from step 1 (which is the equation 3x * 4x * 7x = 18144). The subsequent steps, which refer to the result of step 4, also have to be updated. Step 5 originally referencing x^3 = 216 now directly references the product 18144, continuing with the calculation that finds x = 6 based on the cube root of 216. The last steps calculate the individual numbers based on this newly solved x, however, the calculation for 4x = 24 has been omitted. The transformed solution no longer includes the number 24, reflecting the product of 4x, hence the transformed answer is [18, 42] which is different from the original answer. The first step that references the result of the incorrect or missing step is step 3 of the transformed_solution (which was originally step 4), and therefore, wrong_step is 3.",

The formula used in the transformed solution step 1 is (100 - 20) * (100 - 10) / 100 which equals to 72, not calculating the total decrease percentage directly but resulting in the final value instead. In step 2, it mistakenly subtracts 72 from 100, which would imply that the card was somehow back to its original value and then decreased by 28% in two steps which does not make sense. The result of step 2 of the transformed solution should have been a reduced value, not a percentage. This has led to a transformed answer of 72, which is the percentage of the value remaining after the decreases, not the total percent decrease which is asked in the question, resulting in an incorrect transformed_answer.
