        "explanation": "Here, step 1 has been removed, which calculates the total parts of the ratio. Consequently, step 2 should reference the result from the question, which is 50 doughnuts equivalent to 5 parts. The reference to each part being equivalent to 10 still holds as the calculation method is correct, but since we consider there to be 10 parts of muffins instead of 1, step 2 should be modified to reflect a 1:1 part ratio between doughnuts and muffins. Given there are 50 doughnuts, the calculation changes to 50 x 1 = 50 for the number of muffins, which should ultimately modify the formula to 50 x 1 = 50. It should be noted that the calculation in step 3 maintains the error and refers incorrectly to '10 parts of muffins', as the initial step that created the incorrect carryover effect from the deletion is step 1, thus it is marked as the wrong_step. The transformed_solution erroneously states that there are 100 muffins due to incorrectly maintaining the original step 4 calculation without adjusting for the altered quantity suggested by the deleted step 1 (10 parts was used instead of the correct 1 part, leading to multiplying by 10 instead of 1).",

        "corrected_explanation": "The error in the original solution is a multiplication error in step 2. Since the ratio of doughnuts to muffins is 5:1, and there are 50 doughnuts which represent 5 parts, each part is indeed 10. However, the original solution incorrectly multiplies the number of parts for muffins by 10, which is the number used to find the value of one part. The correct approach is to recognize that muffins are represented by 1 part in the ratio, and thus 1 part of muffins is equal to 10."

Therefore, after deleting step 2, step 3 should reference the result 10x - 40 from step 1 and change the formula from 11x - 40 = 15 to 10x - 40 = 50 + 5. Step 4 inherits the error from step 3, modifying it accordingly from 11x - 40 = 15 to 10x - 40 = 50 + 5.

The modified solution skips the calculation of Shekhar's current age and refers directly to his age after 6 years, which is 26. Since step 1 references a number from the question (Shekhar's age after 6 years), the subsequent step that references the result of step 1 now refers back to the age of Shekhar after 6 years instead. As the next step originally multiplied Shekhar's current age by (3/4) to get Shobha's current age, the transformation led to 26 * (3/4), the largest number provided by the context of the original step 1. This is an error because the age after 6 years was used instead of the current age, giving an inflated number for Shobha's age.
