        "explanation": "Here, step 1 has been removed, which calculates the total parts of the ratio. Consequently, step 2 should reference the result from the question, which is 50 doughnuts equivalent to 5 parts. The reference to each part being equivalent to 10 still holds as the calculation method is correct, but since we consider there to be 10 parts of muffins instead of 1, step 2 should be modified to reflect a 1:1 part ratio between doughnuts and muffins. Given there are 50 doughnuts, the calculation changes to 50 x 1 = 50 for the number of muffins, which should ultimately modify the formula to 50 x 1 = 50. It should be noted that the calculation in step 3 maintains the error and refers incorrectly to '10 parts of muffins', as the initial step that created the incorrect carryover effect from the deletion is step 1, thus it is marked as the wrong_step. The transformed_solution erroneously states that there are 100 muffins due to incorrectly maintaining the original step 4 calculation without adjusting for the altered quantity suggested by the deleted step 1 (10 parts was used instead of the correct 1 part, leading to multiplying by 10 instead of 1).",

The correct calculation for the number of muffins is therefore 1 x 10 = 10, not 10 x 10 = 100."

Step 1 of the original_solution originally involved adding the individual percentages of length and breadth reduction and also including the combined effect of the reductions. However, after deletion, the transformed_solution incorrectly only takes the product of the two percentage reductions (20% x 20%), which actually represents the combined effect, not the entire decrease in area. The combined effect has been mistaken for the total decrease in area, resulting in a calculation that only considers the intersection of the length and breadth reductions. The transformed_solution, therefore, does not add the individual percentage reductions of length and breadth, hence arriving at an incorrect answer of 4%. The first step, which would have been referencing the individual and combined reductions correctly, is now missing.",
