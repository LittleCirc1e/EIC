The divisor itself is the number that gives these remainders, which is the greatest common divisor of the numbers 25, 62, and 105, less any common factors that do not affect the remainder. In this case, the greatest number that divides all three numbers and leaves the same remainder is 7, since 25 = 3 * 7 + 4, 62 = 8 * 7 + 6, and 105 = 15 * 7 + 0."
