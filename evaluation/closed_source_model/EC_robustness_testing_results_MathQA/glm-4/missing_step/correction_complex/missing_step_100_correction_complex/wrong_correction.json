After driving at 50 miles per hour for one hour, she realizes that if she continues at that same average rate she will be an hour late for her flight. She then travels 100 miles per hour for the rest of the trip, and arrives 30 minutes before her flight departs. How many miles did she drive in all?",
        "original_solution": "She drove 50 miles in the first hour because 50 x 1 = 50\nShe drove 150 miles in the second part of the trip because (1 + 1/2) x 100 = 150\nShe drove 200 miles in all because 50 + 150 = 200\n#### 200",

        "explanation": "In this example, the first step which calculates how far Sarah drove in the first hour has been removed. The original step 1 resulted in 50 miles. In the transformed_solution, step 2 which originally added 50 miles from step 1 to 150 miles from what was step 2 in the original_solution must now be corrected to add 0 to 150 miles, since step 1 has been removed. This results in a total distance driven of 150 miles, as stated in the transformed_solution. The deletion of step 1 removes the reference to the number of miles driven in the first hour from the solution, which leads to an incorrect calculation of the total distance driven and a wrong transformed_answer of 150 miles, which is different from the original_answer of 200 miles. Therefore, the wrong_step is the rewritten step 2 in the transformed_solution.",

It should be 100 mph for 1 hour, not based on a fraction of time.

The wrong value is now propagated down through the calculation of x^2 which results in an incorrect value for x and consequently for 2x.
