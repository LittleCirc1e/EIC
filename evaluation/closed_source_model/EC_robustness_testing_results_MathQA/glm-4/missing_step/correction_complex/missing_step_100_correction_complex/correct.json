Consequently, step 2 should reference the result from the question, which is 50 doughnuts equivalent to 5 parts. The reference to each part being equivalent to 10 still holds as the calculation method is correct, but since we consider there to be 10 parts of muffins instead of 1, step 2 should be modified to reflect a 1:1 part ratio between doughnuts and muffins. Given there are 50 doughnuts, the calculation changes to 50 x 1 = 50 for the number of muffins, which should ultimately modify the formula to 50 x 1 = 50. It should be noted that the calculation in step 3 maintains the error and refers incorrectly to '10 parts of muffins', as the initial step that created the incorrect carryover effect from the deletion is step 1, thus it is marked as the wrong_step. The transformed_solution erroneously states that there are 100 muffins due to incorrectly maintaining the original step 4 calculation without adjusting for the altered quantity suggested by the deleted step 1 (10 parts was used instead of the correct 1 part, leading to multiplying by 10 instead of 1).",

        "corrected_answer": 780.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The original solution incorrectly sets up the equation by double-counting the extra bananas. It assumes that the total number of bananas distributed is 2x when all children are present and 2(x - 390) when 390 children are absent, which is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that the extra bananas only make up for the absent children's share. The corrected equation should be 2x = 2(x - 390) + 390 * 2, which simplifies to 2x = 2x, and then the correct equation to solve for x is based on the fact that the extra bananas are equivalent to the absent children's two bananas each, leading to the correct number of children in the school, which is 780."

The original step references the number 9.25 from the question and the division is performed accordingly to determine the cost price per meter. By changing the divisor from 9.25 to 9 (a number smaller than 9.25), the formula becomes 434.75 / 9, resulting in the incorrect transformed answer.

In the original_solution, step 1 references the numbers 15 and 1 from the question and step 2 references the result 14 of step 1 to calculate the total number of games. After deleting step 1, the calculation in step 2 changes to directly use the number 15 from the question, mistakenly assuming each team plays itself once, without subtracting 1. Therefore, the formula has been adjusted from 15 x (15-1) / 2 to 15 x 15 / 2, yielding an incorrect total of 112.5 games.

        "corrected_explanation": "The initial approach correctly identifies the formula to use for a round-robin tournament, which is n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of teams. However, the explanation contains an error as it states that the division by 2 is to correct the double-counting, which is not accurate. The division by 2 is actually to account for the fact that each game involves two teams. The error also includes the incorrect calculation of 15 x 15 / 2, which should be (15 x (15 - 1)) / 2 to avoid counting a game with itself. The corrected calculation results in 105 games, not 112.5."
