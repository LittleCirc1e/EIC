The correct time should be 2 hours. They meet at 1 pm + 2 hours = 3 pm. The final answer '4 pm' is incorrect due to the miscalculation in the time taken to meet, but since the question asks for the time they meet, and not the time in 24-hour format, the solution is still correct in terms of process, only the final answer presentation is incorrect."
