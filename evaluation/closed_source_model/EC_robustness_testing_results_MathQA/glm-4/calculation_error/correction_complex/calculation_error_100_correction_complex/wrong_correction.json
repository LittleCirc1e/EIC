        "corrected_answer": 3.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The mistake in the original solution is that it calculates the distance Maxwell travels as if he were going to cover the full distance to Brad's house, instead of just meeting in the middle. Since they meet in the middle of the 36 kilometers, Maxwell would only travel half of the distance he would travel to cover the full 36 kilometers. Therefore, the correct distance Maxwell travels is 3 kilometers, not 6."
