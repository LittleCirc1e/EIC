        "transformed_solution": "Let the number be x.\nx = 39a + 16 for some integer a\nx = 39a + 16 = 13a*3 + 13*1 + 2\nThe remainder is 2\n#### 2",

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly identifies that the remainder of the number when divided by 13 is 2. This is because any number that leaves a remainder of 16 when divided by 39 (which is a multiple of 13) can be expressed as 39a + 16, where 'a' is an integer. When this expression is broken down, it is clear that it is also divisible by 13, leaving a remainder of 2 (since 39a is divisible by 13 and 13*1 + 2 = 15, which leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 13)."
