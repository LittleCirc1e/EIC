        "corrected_explanation": "Step 3 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating the difference in revolutions per minute incorrectly as 2400-1200=1200 instead of 40-20=20. The subsequent steps incorrectly reference this result, leading to the final incorrect answer of 5 seconds. The correct calculation is that gear r makes 20 more revolutions per minute than gear l, and it will take 18 seconds to make exactly 6 more revolutions."
