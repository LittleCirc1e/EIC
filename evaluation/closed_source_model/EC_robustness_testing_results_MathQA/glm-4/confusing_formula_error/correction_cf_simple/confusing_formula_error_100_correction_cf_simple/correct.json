However, in the transformed_solution, the surface area formula for a rectangular box is mistakenly used instead, which is given by the formula SA = 2*(length*width + width*height + height*length). As a result, the calculation changes from V = 28 * 10 * 5 = 1400 cubic meters in the original_solution to V = 2*(28*10 + 10*5 + 5*28) = 2*(280 + 50 + 140) = 2*470 = 940 cubic meters in the transformed_solution, leading to a different answer.

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the volume and area of a cube. The question requires that the volume of the cube to be solved be equal to the side cubed, rather than the side squared, which is equivalent to the area of a face of the cube, resulting in (2x)^3=8x^3 in the original_solution becoming (2x)^2=4x^2 in the transformed_solution. This affects the ratio calculated in the last step, changing from 8x^3 : 27x^3 to 4x^2 : 27x^3. Note that the language description of step 2 < The volume of the first cube is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 2 mistakenly uses the formula for the area of a square face of the cube, while the other steps correctly use the formula for the cube volume, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",

        "corrected_solution": "Let the side of the first cube be 2x and the side of the second cube be 3x. The volume of a cube is calculated by raising the side length to the power of 3. So, the volume of the first cube is (2x)^3=8x^3 and the volume of the second cube is (3x)^3=27x^3. Therefore, the ratio of their volumes is 8x^3 : 27x^3.",
        "corrected_answer": "8:27",
        "corrected_explanation": "The error in the original solution is a confusion between squaring and cubing the side lengths when calculating the volume of the cubes. The correct formula for the volume of a cube is side length cubed (side^3), not squared (side^2). Once the correct formula is applied, the volumes are 8x^3 and 27x^3, giving a ratio of 8:27."

The original_solution correctly states this as 6 * (16 cm * 16 cm).
