To find the volume of the box, we need to solve for the dimensions l, w, and h. We can start by solving for w: w = 120/l. Similarly, h = 72/l and h = 60/w. By substituting w = 120/l into h = 60/w, we get h = 60/(120/l) which simplifies to h = 6l/10. Now we have two equations for h, which should be equal, so 72/l = 6l/10. Solving for l, we get l^2 = 720/6, which simplifies to l^2 = 120, so l = √120 = 10.916. Now we can find w and h using the original ratios: w = 120/l = 120/10.916 ≈ 11 and h = 72/l = 72/10.916 ≈ 6.6. The volume of the box is lwh = 10.916 * 11 * 6.6 ≈ 799.896 cubic cm.",

The new radius can be found by taking the square root of the new area: new radius = sqrt(0.64πr^2)/π. Simplifying this gives new radius = sqrt(0.64)r.

Additionally, the original solution contained a mathematical error in the calculation of x, which should be √(32/9) instead of 2.
