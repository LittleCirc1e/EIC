        "original_solution": "If the volume of the cube is 729, then the length of each side is the cube root of 729, which is 9.\nThe surface area of the cube is 6 times the area of one face, so it is 6*9*9=486 square units.\n#### 486",
        "original_answer": 486.0,
        "transformed_solution": "If the volume of the cube is 729, then the length of each side is the cube root of 729, which is 9.\nThe surface area of the cube is 6 times the length of each side, so it is 6*9=54 square units.\n#### 54",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, step 2 confuses the formula for calculating the surface area of a cube with the formula for calculating the perimeter of a face of the cube. The surface area of a cube is obtained by multiplying the area of one face by 6, but in the transformed_solution the surface area is incorrectly calculated by multiplying the length of one side by 6, which would be equivalent to a perimeter if the cube was in 2D. The correct operation should be to square the length of one side then multiply by 6 for the total surface area, so the formula 6*9*9=486 in the original_solution was changed to 6*9=54 in the transformed_solution. This results in a different surface area calculation, and as required, only the formula in step 2 is changed while the cube root calculation in step 1 remains correct.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "corrected_solution": "none",
        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the surface area of the cube by first determining the length of each side, which is the cube root of the volume. Then it correctly applies the formula for the surface area of a cube, which is 6 times the area of one face (which is the square of the side length). Since the side length is 9 units, the surface area is indeed 6 * 9 * 9 = 54 square units, as stated."
