        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references the increased average speed as 70 km/hr from the previous step instead of 65 km/hr and changes 65 / 65 = 1 hour to 70 / 65 = 1.077 hours. It should be noted that step 3 in the transformed_solution <New speed is 60 + 5 = 65 km/hr> should be the same as the step 3 in the original_solution <New speed is 60 + 5 = 65 km/hr> and calculates its result 65 km/hr correctly. The erroneous step 4 results in a miscalculated time taken with the new speed, but since we only consider one step error, all other steps that reference these numbers still reference them correctly. Furthermore, the transformed_answer should be different from the original_answer, which is achieved with the mistake in referencing.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Convert 65 min to hours: 65 / 60 = 1.083 hours\nCalculate the distance: 60 km/hr * 1.083 hours = 64.98 km\nNew speed is 60 km/hr + 5 km/hr = 65 km/hr\nTime taken with new speed: distance / new speed = 64.98 km / 65 km/hr = 1.0045 hours\n",
        "corrected_answer": "1.0045",
        "corrected_explanation": "The original solution incorrectly calculates the distance by multiplying the average speed by the time in hours, without considering that the time needs to be converted to a decimal first. The new time calculation also incorrectly divides the new speed by 70 instead of using the distance. The corrected solution properly calculates the distance based on the time and original speed, then uses this distance to find the time taken at the new speed."
