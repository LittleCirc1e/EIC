The corrected solution takes into account both copper and zinc content of both alloys and solves for the correct mixing ratio that would result in equal proportions of copper and zinc in the final alloy."

        "corrected_explanation": "The original solution has an error in the equation setup. It should be '3x = 2(x+4) - 7' because thrice the first number should exceed double the third number by 7, not be equal to it plus 7. The corrected equation leads to the correct third number which is x + 4, where x = 1, thus the third number is 5."

The erroneous step 4 results in a miscalculated time taken with the new speed, but since we only consider one step error, all other steps that reference these numbers still reference them correctly.
