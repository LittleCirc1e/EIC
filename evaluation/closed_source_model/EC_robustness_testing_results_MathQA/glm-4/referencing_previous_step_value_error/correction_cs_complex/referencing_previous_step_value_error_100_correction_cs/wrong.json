It should be noted that step 2 in the transformed_solution <7n < 49 because 44 + 5 = 49> should be the same as step 2 in the original_solution <7n < 49 because 44 + 5 = 49> and calculates its result 49 correctly. The subsequent step 4 is affected by step 3 and changes n < 7 because 49 / 7 = 7 to n < 7.1 because 50 / 7 = 7.1. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all steps is still correct.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly solves both inequalities and determines the correct range for n. It first simplifies the inequalities by subtracting 2 from 17 and adding 5 to 44 to get 15 and 49 respectively. Then it correctly divides by the coefficients of n (5 and 7) to find the lower and upper bounds for n, which are 3 and 7.1. The final answer of 3 < n < 7.1 is correctly derived from these steps."
