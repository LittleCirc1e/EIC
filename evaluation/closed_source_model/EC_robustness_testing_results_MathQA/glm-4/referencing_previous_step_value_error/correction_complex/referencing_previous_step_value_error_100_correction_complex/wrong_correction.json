The correct calculation should be (4.90 - 1.85) / 0.15 = 21, not 20.33. The original solution incorrectly rounded down the number of additional quarters, but since we cannot travel a fraction of a quarter mile, we must use the whole number. The final answer remains the same at 5.25 miles, as the calculation of 21 quarters * 0.25 mile is correct."

The time 't' when they meet is supposed to be '4' hours as correctly found in step 6, which affects step 7 leading to the incorrect calculation of Maxwell's distance in the transformed_solution.
