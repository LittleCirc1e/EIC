        "explanation": "Here, step 1 has been removed, which calculates the total parts of the ratio. Consequently, step 2 should reference the result from the question, which is 50 doughnuts equivalent to 5 parts. The reference to each part being equivalent to 10 still holds as the calculation method is correct, but since we consider there to be 10 parts of muffins instead of 1, step 2 should be modified to reflect a 1:1 part ratio between doughnuts and muffins. Given there are 50 doughnuts, the calculation changes to 50 x 1 = 50 for the number of muffins, which should ultimately modify the formula to 50 x 1 = 50. It should be noted that the calculation in step 3 maintains the error and refers incorrectly to '10 parts of muffins', as the initial step that created the incorrect carryover effect from the deletion is step 1, thus it is marked as the wrong_step. The transformed_solution erroneously states that there are 100 muffins due to incorrectly maintaining the original step 4 calculation without adjusting for the altered quantity suggested by the deleted step 1 (10 parts was used instead of the correct 1 part, leading to multiplying by 10 instead of 1).",

        "explanation": "In the original_solution, step 2 is an equation involving -2a and a quantity of b. The subsequent steps calculate expressions involving 2a and 22b. We remove the third step, which involves a simple reiteration of the equation from step 2. Because the deleted step is just an exact repetition and doesn't involve any calculation with new values, we need to update the formula in the next step to reflect an actual step of combining the two equations. The correct transformation to combine them would be to add the equations together before isolating terms. So we transform step 2 from -2a - 12b = 10b + 80 to (9a - b) - (-2a + 12b) = 10b + 80, and then simplify it to get 7a + 11b = 80. The subsequent step then multiplies the b term by 2 to match the term 22b in the question. The result now becomes 2a + 22b = 160/7 or approximately 22.8571428571.",

The modified solution skips the calculation of Shekhar's current age and refers directly to his age after 6 years, which is 26. Since step 1 references a number from the question (Shekhar's age after 6 years), the subsequent step that references the result of step 1 now refers back to the age of Shekhar after 6 years instead. As the next step originally multiplied Shekhar's current age by (3/4) to get Shobha's current age, the transformation led to 26 * (3/4), the largest number provided by the context of the original step 1. This is an error because the age after 6 years was used instead of the current age, giving an inflated number for Shobha's age.

As a result, the subtraction operation in step 4 is incorrect, but it still reveals that the equation 2x - 780 = 2x + 780 cannot hold true unless the extra bananas (780) is balanced out by an equal amount on the other side of the equation (-780 = 780). Hence, in step 5, instead of equating -780 to 390, it should equate -780 to 780 to maintain this balance. Step 6 then incorrectly solves for x by dividing 780 by 2, which yields the incorrect answer of x = 390.
