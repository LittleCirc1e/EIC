        "explanation": "In this example, the first step is deleted. The original_solution's step 1 references the number 5 and 15 from the question, but step 1's result is not referenced by any subsequent steps directly. However, deleting it means step 2 would be invalid as it stands. By altering step 2 to reference-the largest number referenced in the original step 1, which is 15, the formula changes from 5/15 = 1/3 to 15/15 = 1, thereby eliminating the entire calculation process as 1 - 1 equals 0. All subsequent steps then reflect the calculation based on zero remaining work, leading to a transformed answer of 0 days for x to finish the 'remaining' work, which mistakenly implies no work is left. It is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 2 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing incorrect number in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 1.",
