        "explanation": "In this example, the first step has been omitted, and its calculations wrongly incorporated into a single transformed step. The increase in speed after two intervals (which should be 2 + 5 * 2 = 12 miles per hour) is correctly calculated, but the multiplication by the fraction representing 5 minutes in an hour (5/60) is incorrectly done. Due to this, the distance traveled in the third interval equation changes to (2 + 5 * 2) * (5 / 60) in the transformed_solution. Since the omission has led to a calculation error in the combined single step, the wrong_step is 1. The transformed answer of 2 miles is incorrect as the actual distance traveled in the third 5-minute interval should be 1 mile.",

        "explanation": "The example removes intermediate step 2. In the original_solution, step 3 references result (1 - y) from step 2, and step 4 references the result of step 3. Therefore, after deleting step 2, step 4 should reference the result 0.005 from step 3 only. However, the number 0.007 was incorrectly subtracted by the value 0.005 - instead of subtracting the expression (0.005*(1-y)), leading to the incorrect solution. Steps 5, 6, and 7, as subsequent related steps, are affected by this wrong calculation. Step 5 will change 0.008y - 0.005y = 0.007 - 0.005 to 0.008y = 0.007 - 0.005, step 6 will change 0.003y = 0.002 to 0.008y = 0.002, and step 7 will change y = 0.002 / 0.003 to y = 0.002 / 0.008.
