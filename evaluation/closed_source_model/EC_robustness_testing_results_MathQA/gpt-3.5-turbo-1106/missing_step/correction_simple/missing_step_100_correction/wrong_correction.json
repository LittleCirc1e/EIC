        "explanation": "Here, step 1 has been removed, which calculates the total parts of the ratio. Consequently, step 2 should reference the result from the question, which is 50 doughnuts equivalent to 5 parts. The reference to each part being equivalent to 10 still holds as the calculation method is correct, but since we consider there to be 10 parts of muffins instead of 1, step 2 should be modified to reflect a 1:1 part ratio between doughnuts and muffins. Given there are 50 doughnuts, the calculation changes to 50 x 1 = 50 for the number of muffins, which should ultimately modify the formula to 50 x 1 = 50. It should be noted that the calculation in step 3 maintains the error and refers incorrectly to '10 parts of muffins', as the initial step that created the incorrect carryover effect from the deletion is step 1, thus it is marked as the wrong_step. The transformed_solution erroneously states that there are 100 muffins due to incorrectly maintaining the original step 4 calculation without adjusting for the altered quantity suggested by the deleted step 1 (10 parts was used instead of the correct 1 part, leading to multiplying by 10 instead of 1).",

However, instead of directly using the speed in km/hr (which would be incorrect as the units must match), the speed is mistakenly changed to 72 m/s (a much higher speed), which results in an incorrect conversion and impacts the formula in step 2. This change wrongly modifies the original formula \"280 m / 20 m/s\" to \"280 m / 72 m/s,\" resulting in an incorrect time calculation of 3.89 seconds.

Since step 1 references a number from the question (Shekhar's age after 6 years), the subsequent step that references the result of step 1 now refers back to the age of Shekhar after 6 years instead. As the next step originally multiplied Shekhar's current age by (3/4) to get Shobha's current age, the transformation led to 26 * (3/4), the largest number provided by the context of the original step 1.
