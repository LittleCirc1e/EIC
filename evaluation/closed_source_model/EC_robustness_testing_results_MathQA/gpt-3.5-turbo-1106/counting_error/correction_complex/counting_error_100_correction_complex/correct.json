        "question": "John had a stock of 620 books in his bookshop. He sold 50 on Monday, 82 on Tuesday, 60 on Wednesday, 48 on Thursday, and 40 on Friday. What percentage of the books were not sold?",
        "original_solution": "The total number of books sold is 50 + 82 + 60 + 48 + 40 = 280 books\nThe number of books not sold is 620 - 280 = 340 books\nThe percentage of books not sold is (340 / 620) * 100 = 54.84%\n#### 54.84%",
        "original_answer": 54.84,
        "transformed_solution": "The total number of books sold is 50 + 82 + 60 + 48 + 40 = 280 books\nThe number of books not sold is 620 - 280 = 340 books\nInstead of 5 days, we say books were sold in 4 days (counting error).\nThe incorrect percentage of books not sold is (340 / 620) * 100 / 4 = 13.71%\n#### 13.71%",
        "transformed_answer": 13.71,
        "wrong_step": 3,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, there was a counting error introduced in the calculation of the percentage. The division by the number of days (which was 5 in reality but mistakenly counted as 4) is not relevant for the calculation of the percentage of books not sold. The incorrect transformation changed the calculation from a correct percentage to an incorrect value by dividing the percentage of books not sold by 4, which is unrelated to the number of days books were sold.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "The total number of books sold is 50 + 82 + 60 + 48 + 40 = 280 books\nThe number of books not sold is 620 - 280 = 340 books\nThe correct percentage of books not sold is (340 / 620) * 100 = 54.84\n#### 54.84",
        "corrected_answer": 54.84,
        "corrected_explanation": "Step 4 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, dividing by 4 instead of just multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. The subsequent step 4 references the result of step 3, calculating (340 / 620) * 100 / 4 = 13.71% instead of (340 / 620) * 100 = 54.84, resulting in the final incorrect answer."
