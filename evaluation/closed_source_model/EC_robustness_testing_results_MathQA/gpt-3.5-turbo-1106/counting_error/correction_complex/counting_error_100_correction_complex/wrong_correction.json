        "question": "on sunday , bill ran 4 more miles than he ran on saturday . julia did not run on saturday , but she ran twice the number of miles on sunday that bill ran on sunday . if bill and julia ran a total of 28 miles on saturday and sunday , how many miles did bill run on sunday ?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the number of miles Bill ran on Saturday\nTherefore, Bill ran x + 4 miles on Sunday\nJulia ran 2(x+4) = 2x + 8 miles on Sunday\nThe total number of miles Bill and Julia ran is x + x + 4 + 2x + 8 = 28\n4x + 12 = 28\n4x = 16\nx = 4\nTherefore, Bill ran x + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8 miles on Sunday\n#### 8",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 3 erroneously counts the number of miles Julia ran as equal to the number of miles Bill ran on Sunday instead of twice. This causes step 3 to change from 2(x+4)=2x+8 to 1(x+4)=x+4, a counting error of the miles Julia ran. And it affects the subsequent related steps: step 4 is changed from 4x + 12 = 28 to 3x + 8 = 28, step 5 is changed from 4x = 16 to 3x = 20, step 6 is changed from x = 4 to x = 6.6667, and step 7, the conclusion, is changed from Bill ran 8 miles to Bill ran 10.6667 miles on Sunday. The error is isolated to this multiplication factor, and all other arithmetic steps are correct.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution is incorrect because it calculates the average number of miles Bill and Julia ran, instead of calculating the number of miles Bill ran on Sunday. The correct calculation should be x + 4 = 6.6667 + 4 = 10.6667 miles on Sunday."

        "original_solution": "The total number of books sold is 75 + 50 + 64 + 78 + 135 = 402 books\nThe number of books not sold is 1300 - 402 = 898 books\nThe percentage of books not sold is (898 / 1300) * 100 = 69%\n#### 69",

        "explanation": "In step 1 of the transformed_solution, the number of books sold on Friday is mistakenly counted as 120 instead of the original number 135. This affects the calculation of the total number of books sold, the remainder not sold, and the respective percentage. The change from 135 to 120 has modified the subsequent steps without affecting the unrelated steps, resulting in a transformed answer of approximately 70.231% compared to the original answer of 69%.",
