It should be noted that only the first step contains a counting error, and subsequent calculations are based on this mistake; however, these calculations are performed correctly based on the altered inputs.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "The total hours worked from Monday through Friday is 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 hours\nThe total number of days from Monday through Friday is 5 days\nThe average number of hours Sheila works per day is 28 / 5 = 5.6 hours\nShe earns $396 per week\nSo, she earns $396 / 28 hours = $14.14 per hour\n#### 14.14",
        "corrected_answer": 14.14,
        "corrected_explanation": "Step 3 erroneously counts Monday, Wednesday, and Friday as 4 days instead of 5 days, resulting in an error in the divisor in the formula. And step 3 calculates 28/4=7 instead of 28/5=5.6, resulting in the final incorrect answer."
