        "original_solution": "The reduced rates apply to the following times: \n8 p.m. to 8 a.m. weekdays (12 hours) and 24 hours on weekends (Saturday and Sunday)\nFrom Monday to Friday, there are 5 days, and each day has 12 hours of reduced rates\nOn Saturday and Sunday, there are 2 days, and each day has 24 hours of reduced rates\nTherefore, the total hours of reduced rates in a week is 5*12 + 2*24 = 60 + 48 = 108 hours\nThe total number of hours in a week is 7*24 = 168 hours\nSo, the fraction of the week with reduced rates is 108 / 168 = 9 / 14\n#### 9/14",
