        "original_answer": 25.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The first multiple of 4 after 16 is 20 (including the starting number: 16), and the last multiple of 4 before 112 is 112.\nDivide the endpoints by 4: 20/4 = 5, 112/4 = 28\nSubtract 1 from 28 because it is inclusive: 28 - 5 + 1 = 24\n#### 24",

        "explanation": "Step 1 adds incorrect and irrelevant information that changes the first multiple of 4 from 16 to 20, which is not following the question statement as 16 itself is a multiple of 4. This results in the step 1 calculation incorrectly changing from dividing 16 by 4 to dividing 20 by 4. Consequently, the first quotient (related to the starting number) incorrectly changes from 4 to 5. This affects the final calculation, causing the result to be 1 number less than the correct answer.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly identifies the first and last multiples of 4 within the given range and applies the formula (last - first) / 4 + 1 to find the number of multiples of 4, which is 24."

        "explanation": "Step 1 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement by supposing there is an additional red marble in the bag, which changes the total number of marbles and affects the probabilities calculated. As a result, the probability calculations in the transformed_solution incorrectly account for the total number of marbles as 9 instead of 8, and thus the answer is altered from 15/28 in the original_solution to 5/12 in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that even though this change affects multiple probabilities calculated later in the solution, it originates from a single point of error in the initial assumption.",
