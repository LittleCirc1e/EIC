        "explanation": "Step 3 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <However, due to union regulations, there is a mandatory 15-minute break per hour when working together which accounts for a 1/4 hour loss of work.>, resulting in step 3 changing from 1/8 + 1/6 = 7/24 in the original_solution to 1/8 + 1/6 -1/4 = 5/24 in the transformed_solution. This also affects the calculation in step 4, changing the answer from 24/7 hours to 24/5 hours to complete the job working together.
