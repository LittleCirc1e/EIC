        "explanation": "This example changes the multiplication operator in step 4 to addition, altering 3 * 3 = 9 to 3 + 3 = 6. The subsequent calculation of probability in step 5 inherits this change and therefore the probability changes from 9/15 = 3/5 to 6/15 = 2/5. The altered step now has an incorrect result, but all the other calculations remain correct, even though they are based on the wrong number obtained in step 4.",
