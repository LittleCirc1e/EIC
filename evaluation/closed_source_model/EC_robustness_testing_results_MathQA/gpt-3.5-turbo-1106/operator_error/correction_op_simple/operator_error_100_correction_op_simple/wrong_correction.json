        "explanation": "The example changes the subtraction in step 1 to addition, converting 1/3 - 1/8 to 1/3 + 1/8 and therefore changing the result from 5/24 to 11/24. This affects step 2, where the time taken to fill the cistern changes from 24/5 = 4.8 hours to 24/11 = 2.1818 hours. The calculation in step 1 is done correctly but with the wrong operator, leading to an incorrect result, and this error carries over to step 2. However, step 2 calculations are performed correctly using the incorrect result from step 1.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The mistake occurred in the step where the combined rate of both taps was calculated. The correct combined rate should be 1/3 - 1/8 = 5/24 cistern/hour. Using this rate, the correct time to fill the cistern would be 24/5 = 4.8 hours."
