        "explanation": "This example changes the multiplication operator in step 4 to addition, altering 3 * 3 = 9 to 3 + 3 = 6. The subsequent calculation of probability in step 5 inherits this change and therefore the probability changes from 9/15 = 3/5 to 6/15 = 2/5. The altered step now has an incorrect result, but all the other calculations remain correct, even though they are based on the wrong number obtained in step 4.",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this example, the addition in the original equation 6t + 3t = 36 was changed to subtraction, making it 6t - 3t = 36. The subtraction led to a new equation, 3t = 36, with t being incorrectly calculated to satisfy the incorrect equation. This results in a wrong time of t=12, which affects the subsequent calculation of Maxwell's distance. The correct calculation of step 5 becomes 3t = 36, giving t = 12, and step 6 then multiplies Maxwell’s speed by this incorrect time to get a final incorrect result of 36 kilometers. All other steps have been correctly calculated based on the modified values.",
