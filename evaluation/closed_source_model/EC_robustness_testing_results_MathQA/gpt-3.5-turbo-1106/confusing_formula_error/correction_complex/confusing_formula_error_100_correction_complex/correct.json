        "explanation": "Here, step 6 confuses the formula for calculating the area of a triangle with the formula for calculating the semi-perimeter of a triangle. The question requires that the area of the triangle to be solved be equal to 0.5 multiplied by the base multiplied by the height, rather than summing up the lengths of the three sides and dividing by 2, which is equivalent to the semi-perimeter of the triangle. This results in 0.5*12*9 = 54 square cm in the original_solution being changed to (12+9+15)/2 = 18 square cm in the transformed_solution. Note that the language description of step 6 \"So the area of the triangle is\" in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that this is a single step error where only the formula in step 6 has been confused while the previous steps are correct. The explanation clearly describes the conversion from the original solution to the transformed solution with the specific error introduced.",

The question requires that the volume of the cube to be solved be equal to the side length cubed, not 3 times the square of the side length, which is a dimensionally incorrect representation of surface area (and not even the correct formula for surface area). This error results in the original equation x^3=64 being replaced by 3*x*x=64, thus solving for x gives an incorrect value, approximately 4.62 instead of the correct 4. The subsequent steps apply the incorrect side length to determine the new cube's measurements and volume. Therefore, step 2 from  x^3=64 has been modified to 3*x*x=64 in the transformed_solution, and this single incorrect application of a formula results in a subsequently incorrect computed volume of 787.305 cubic feet instead of the correct 512 cubic feet.
