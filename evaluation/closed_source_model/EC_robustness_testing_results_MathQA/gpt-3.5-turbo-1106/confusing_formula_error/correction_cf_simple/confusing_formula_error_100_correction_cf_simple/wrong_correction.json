        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by the width. However, the transformed solution replaces the formula for area with the formula for perimeter, resulting in an incorrect expansion of 2*((x+10) + x) = 144 instead of (x+10)*x = 144. This affects the subsequent related steps, changing the quadratics and their resolution to a linear equation and its resolution. Note that the language description of step 3 < The area of the field is given by > remains unchanged in the transformed_solution as < The perimeter of the field is given by >, causing the mistake by changing the formula used without modifying the descriptive text. It should be also noted that the only error occurs in step 3, and the initial steps and definitions remain correct.",
