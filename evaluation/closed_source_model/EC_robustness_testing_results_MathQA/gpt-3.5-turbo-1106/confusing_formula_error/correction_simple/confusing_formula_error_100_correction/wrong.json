        "question": "90 litres of diesel is required to travel 600 km using a 800 cc engine. If the volume of diesel required to cover a distance varies directly as the capacity of the engine, then how many litres of diesel is required to travel 800 km using 1200 cc engine?",
        "original_solution": "First, find the rate of diesel consumption: 90 liters / 600 km = 0.15 liters/km\nThen, use the rate to find the required diesel for 800 km: 0.15 liters/km * 800 km = 120 liters\nFinally, adjust for the engine capacity: 120 liters * (1200 cc / 800 cc) = 180 liters\n#### 180",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 mistakenly uses the original distance of 600 km instead of the new distance of 800 km when calculating the required diesel for the trip. The original solution correctly multiplies the rate (0.15 liters/km) by 800 km to find out how much diesel is needed for 800 km, which is 120 liters. In the transformed solution, step 2 has been modified to use the original distance of 600 km, so it now incorrectly calculates 0.15 liters/km * 600 km = 90 liters. This change affects the final step, step 3, changing the answer from 180 liters to 135 liters. Note that the language description of steps 2 and 3 remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It's also important to note that only one step has a confusing formula error while other calculation processes are still correct. Here, step 2 is the only wrong step with the error of confusing distances, while steps 1 and 3 remain correct in their calculations.",

The perimeter of a square is given by 4 times the side length, while the area is given by the side squared. Thus, in the transformed solution, the calculation of the actual area of the square is mistakenly changed from x^2 to 4*x, the formula for the perimeter. This in turn affects step 4, changing the calculation of the area with the error from (1.04x)^2 to simply 4*1.04x, and this will affect the final error percentage calculation in step 5. We have to recalculate the error percentage based on the incorrect area calculation, yielding a transformed answer of 4%.
