        "original_solution": "The area of a circle is calculated using the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle.\nThe area of the larger sign is π(7r)^2, which simplifies to 49πr^2.\nThe area of the smaller sign is πr^2.\nTo find out how many times more paint is needed for the larger sign, we divide the area of the larger sign by the area of the smaller sign: 49πr^2 / πr^2 = 49 times more paint is needed.\n#### 49",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the area and circumference of a circle. The question requires that the area of the circle to be solved be equal to π multiplied by the radius squared, rather than 2 times π multiplied by radius, which is equivalent to the circumference of the circle, resulting in an area  calculation π(7r)^2 in the original_solution becoming a circumference calculation 2π(7r) in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 4, changing from dividing areas (49πr^2 / πr^2 = 49) to dividing circumferences (14πr / 2πr = 7).

As a result, this step does not calculate the correct division representation of the ratio.
