Thus, in the transformed solution, the calculation of the actual area of the square is mistakenly changed from x^2 to 4*x, the formula for the perimeter. This in turn affects step 4, changing the calculation of the area with the error from (1.04x)^2 to simply 4*1.04x, and this will affect the final error percentage calculation in step 5. We have to recalculate the error percentage based on the incorrect area calculation, yielding a transformed answer of 4%. Note that the language description of step 3 in the original solution <The actual area of the square is > remains unchanged in the transformed solution. The other steps related to calculation in the transformed solution are adjusted accordingly to maintain logical coherence after the initial error.",
