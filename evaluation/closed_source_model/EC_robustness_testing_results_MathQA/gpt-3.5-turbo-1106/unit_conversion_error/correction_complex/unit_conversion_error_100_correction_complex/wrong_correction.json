        "original_answer": 180.0,
        "transformed_solution": "There are 60 seconds in a minute and 50 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 x 50 = 3000 seconds in an hour.\nThe light flashes 3000 / 20 = 150 times in an hour.\n#### 150",

And it affects the subsequent related step 2, which changes from 3600 / 20 = 180 times to 3000 / 20 = 150 times.

        "original_solution": "First, we need to convert 40 minutes to seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 40 minutes * 60 seconds per minute = 2400 seconds.\nThe population increases by 1 person every 15 seconds, so 2400 seconds / 15 seconds per person = 160 persons.\n#### 160",
