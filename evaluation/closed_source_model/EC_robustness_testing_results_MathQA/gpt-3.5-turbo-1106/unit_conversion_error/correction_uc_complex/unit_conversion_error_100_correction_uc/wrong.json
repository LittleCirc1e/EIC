        "explanation": "Here, step 4 makes an incorrect unit conversion, which erroneously suggests there are 50 minutes in an hour instead of 60 minutes, resulting in 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes in the original_solution becoming 2 hours * 50 minutes/hour = 100 minutes in the transformed_solution. This changes the original_answer from 120 minutes to 100 minutes, introducing a unit conversion error. The error is isolated to just this single wrong step, while the other steps' computations remain correct.",
