        "question": "Excluding stoppages, the speed of a bus is 54 kmph and including stoppages, it is 45 kmph. For how many minutes does the bus stop per hour?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the time the bus stops per hour in minutes.\nAccording to the question, the distance remains constant, so the time taken is inversely proportional to the speed.\nSo, 54 kmph = (60 minutes per hour) / (60 - x) minutes per hour and 45 kmph = (60 minutes per hour) / x minutes per hour.\nSolving for x, we get x = 10.\n#### 10",

        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the time the bus stops per hour in minutes.\nAccording to the question, the distance remains constant, so the time taken is inversely proportional to the speed.\nSo, 54 kmph = (50 minutes per hour) / (50 - x) minutes per hour and 45 kmph = (50 minutes per hour) / x minutes per hour.\nSolving for x, we get x = 5.\n#### 5",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 makes an incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 hour is wrongly calculated as 50 minutes instead of the actual 60 minutes. This has subsequently affected the equation in step 3, changing it from (60 minutes per hour) / (60 - x) minutes and (60 minutes per hour) / x minutes to (50 minutes per hour) / (50 - x) minutes and (50 minutes per hour) / x minutes. This incorrect unit conversion results in a different solution for x, leading to an altered answer.",

        "explanation": "In the transformed_solution, incorrect unit conversion is applied by changing the time passed after both hourglasses have been flipped to 10 minutes instead of 11. This changes the calculation in step 4, which previously added up to 11 minutes and now incorrectly sums to 10 minutes. As a result, the total time in the final step is now 14 minutes, which is incorrect.
