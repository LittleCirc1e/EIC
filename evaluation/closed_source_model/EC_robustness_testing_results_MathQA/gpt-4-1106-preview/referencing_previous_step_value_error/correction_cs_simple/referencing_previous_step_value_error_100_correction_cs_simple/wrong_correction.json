It should be noted that step 1 in the transformed_solution <Each additional quarter of a mile costs $0.15, so (4.90 - 1.85) / 0.15 = 20.33> should be the same as the step 1 in the original_solution <Each additional quarter of a mile costs $0.15, so (4.90 - 1.85) / 0.15 = 20.33> and calculates the number of quarters 20.33 correctly. However, since we must round down to the nearest whole quarter, the distance should be based on 20 quarters, not 21, resulting in an incorrect transformed_answer of 5.25 miles instead of the correct 5 miles.

        "corrected_answer": 5.25,
        "corrected_explanation": "After subtracting the initial charge for the first quarter mile, the remaining amount is divided by the cost per additional quarter mile. The result gives the number of additional quarters that can be traveled. Since you cannot travel a fraction of a quarter mile for a fixed rate, we take the whole number of quarters, which is 20. Adding the first quarter mile, we have a total of 21 quarters. Multiplying 21 quarters by 0.25 miles per quarter gives the maximum distance of 5.25 miles."
