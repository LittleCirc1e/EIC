After distributing the 2 into (x+4), the equation should be 3x = 2x + 8 + 7, which simplifies to 3x = 2x + 15, not 2x + 13. Solving 3x = 2x + 15 gives x = 15. Therefore, the third number, which is x + 4, is 19."}
{"question": "a bus started its journey from mumbai and reached pune in 65 min with its average speed of 60 km / hr . if the average speed of the bus is increased by 5 km / hr , how much time will it take to cover the same distance ?", "original_solution": "Convert 65 min to hours: 65 / 60 = 1.083 hours\nCalculate the distance: 60 x 1.083 = 65 km\nNew speed is 60 + 5 = 65 km/hr\nTime taken with new speed: 65 / 65 = 1 hour\n#### 1 hour", "original_answer": "1 hour", "transformed_solution": "Convert 65 min to hours: 65 / 60 = 1.083 hours\nCalculate the distance: 60 x 1.083 = 65 km\nNew speed is 60 + 5 = 65 km/hr\nTime taken with new speed: 70 / 65 = 1.077 hours\n#### 1.077 hours", "transformed_answer": "1.077 hours", "wrong_step": 4, "wrong_type": "referencing_previous_step_value_error", "is_single_error": true, "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references the increased average speed as 70 km/hr from the previous step instead of 65 km/hr and changes 65 / 65 = 1 hour to 70 / 65 = 1.077 hours.
