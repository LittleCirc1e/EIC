        "transformed_solution": "The diameter of the circle y is equal to the side length of the square x because the square is inscribed in the circle.\nSo the diameter of y is 16.\nThe circumference of y is π times the diameter, so the circumference of y is 64π.\n#### 64π",

By removing this step, the subsequent step that originally referenced the result of step 1 now incorrectly references the original total perimeter. Step 2, which is incorrectly using the perimeter to represent the diameter of the circle, should result in an incorrect circumference because it directly uses the perimeter 64 in place of the diameter to calculate the circle’s circumference, as opposed to dividing 64 by 4 to get the correct side length (which is also the diameter). Thus, the wrong step is step 2, because it is the first step in the transformed solution which uses the incorrect number, leading to the transformed answer 64π instead of 16π.",

This results in a total distance driven of 150 miles, as stated in the transformed_solution. The deletion of step 1 removes the reference to the number of miles driven in the first hour from the solution, which leads to an incorrect calculation of the total distance driven and a wrong transformed_answer of 150 miles, which is different from the original_answer of 200 miles.
