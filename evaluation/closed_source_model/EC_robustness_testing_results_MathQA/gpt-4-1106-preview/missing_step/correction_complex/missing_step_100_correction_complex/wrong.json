Hence, the transformed_solution proceeds directly with converting 8% to a fraction as 8/100. However, instead of simplifying this fraction to 2/25, an intentional error is introduced in the simplification process that results in an incorrect fraction of 4/50. Since the transformation starts from the middle of the original solution (skipping the explanation about dividing by 100), the wrong_step is 1.

Hence, the total count of integer values changes from 50 to 49.

The solution also correctly identifies the lower bound for n by considering that 4n + 7 must be greater than 1, which is satisfied for all n >= 0. Therefore, n can take all integer values from 0 to 48, inclusive, which totals 49 possible values. The initial assessment of the solution being incorrect was a mistake; the provided solution is indeed correct."

        "explanation": "This example removes the step that interprets the proportion 0.75/x = 5/8. It goes directly to the cross-multiplication step, which is typically derived from understanding the properties of the proportion. By skipping the proportion setup phase, the subsequent calculation uses direct cross-multiplication without stating the reason, jumping into the arithmetic part: 0.75*8 = 5*x. As the deleted step does not produce a numerical result for reference, and it's an intermediate step where the following step correctly references the numbers from the question, we use those numbers (0.75 and 8, choosing the larger one, which is 8) directly for the cross-multiplication. However, while the arithmetic operation in the transformed step 1 is correct, the ensuing calculation in step 2 incorrectly divides by 5 when it should correctly divide by 5 as in the original solution (and originally explained in the deleted step) but does not. As a consequence of this error, the derived answer of 1.5 in the transformed answer is distinct from the correct original answer of 1.2. It is step 2 in the transformed_solution, which is step 4 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing the incorrect number in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 2.",
