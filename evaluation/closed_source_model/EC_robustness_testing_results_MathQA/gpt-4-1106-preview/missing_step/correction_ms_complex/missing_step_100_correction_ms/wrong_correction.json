        "question": "On Independence Day, bananas were to be equally distributed among the children in a school so that each child would get two bananas. On that particular day, 390 children were absent, and as a result, each child got two extra bananas. Find the actual number of children in the school.",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the actual number of children in the school.\nTotal bananas distributed = 2(x-390) = 2x - 780\nTotal bananas received = 2x + 780\n2x - 780 = 2x + 780\n-780 = 780\nx = 780/2\nx = 390\n#### 390",
        "original_answer": 780.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the actual number of children in the school.\nTotal bananas distributed = 2(x-390)\n2(x-390) = 2x + 780\n2x - 780 = 2x + 780\n-780 = 780\nx = 780/2\nx = 390\n#### 390",

        "explanation": "In the original solution, step 2 expands the equation 2(x-390) to equal 2x - 780, which is correct, but the transformed solution skips this step. Therefore, subsequent steps need to start with the simplified form 2(x-390) and solve for x accordingly. Step 3 now directly equates 2(x-390) with 2x + 780, instead of 2x - 780 = 2x + 780. As a result, the subtraction operation in step 4 is incorrect, but it still reveals that the equation 2x - 780 = 2x + 780 cannot hold true unless the extra bananas (780) is balanced out by an equal amount on the other side of the equation (-780 = 780). Hence, in step 5, instead of equating -780 to 390, it should equate -780 to 780 to maintain this balance. Step 6 then incorrectly solves for x by dividing 780 by 2, which yields the incorrect answer of x = 390. The wrong_step is 2 because that is the first step in the transformed solution that incorrectly references the result of the deleted step (step 2 in the original solution).",

        "corrected_solution": "Let x be the actual number of children in the school.\nTotal bananas for x children = 2x\nTotal bananas for (x - 390) children = 2(x - 390)\nEach child gets 2 extra bananas, so total bananas for (x - 390) children = 2x\nTherefore, 2(x - 390) = 2x + 2 * 390\n2x - 780 = 2x + 780\nSubtract 2x from both sides: -780 = 780, which is incorrect.\nThe correct equation should be: 2x - 780 = 2x + 780\nSubtract 2x from both sides: -780 = 780, which is incorrect.\nWe need to correct the equation: 2(x - 390) = 2x + 2 * 390 should be 2(x - 390) + 2 * 390 = 2x\nSolving the corrected equation: 2x - 780 + 780 = 2x\nThis simplifies to: 2x = 2x\nThis equation does not help us find the value of x, so we need to set up the equation correctly.\nThe correct equation is: 2(x - 390) + 2 * 390 = 2x\n2x - 780 + 780 = 2x\n0 = 0 is a tautology and does not give us information about x.\nWe need to go back and set up the equation correctly considering the extra bananas each child got.\nIf each child got 2 extra bananas, the total number of extra bananas is 2 * 390.\nSo the correct equation is: 2x = 2(x - 390) + 2 * 390\n2x = 2x - 780 + 780\n2x = 2x\nThis equation is still not helpful. We need to consider that the extra bananas are distributed among the children who were present.\nSo the correct equation is: 2x + 2 * 390 = 2(x - 390) + 4 * 390\n2x + 780 = 2x - 780 + 1560\n2x + 780 = 2x + 780\nSubtract 2x from both sides: 780 = 780\nThis is still not correct. We need to distribute the extra bananas to the children who were present, not to the total number of children.\nThe correct equation should be: 2x + 2 * 390 = 2(x - 390) + 2 * (x - 390)\n2x + 780 = 2x - 780 + 2x - 780\n2x + 780 = 4x - 1560\nSubtract 2x from both sides: 780 = 2x - 1560\nAdd 1560 to both sides: 2340 = 2x\nDivide by 2: x = 1170\nThe actual number of children in the school is 1170.",
        "corrected_answer": 1170.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The error in the solution is in the equation setup. The original solution incorrectly equates 2(x - 390) to 2x + 780, which does not account for the fact that the extra bananas are only given to the children who were present, not the total number of children. The correct equation should account for the extra bananas given to the children who were present, which leads to the equation 2x + 2 * 390 = 2(x - 390) + 2 * (x - 390). Solving this equation gives us the actual number of children in the school, which is 1170."
