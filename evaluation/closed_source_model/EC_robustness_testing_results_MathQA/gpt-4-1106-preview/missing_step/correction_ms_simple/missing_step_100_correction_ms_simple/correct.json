        "explanation": "Here, step 1 has been removed, which calculates the total parts of the ratio. Consequently, step 2 should reference the result from the question, which is 50 doughnuts equivalent to 5 parts. The reference to each part being equivalent to 10 still holds as the calculation method is correct, but since we consider there to be 10 parts of muffins instead of 1, step 2 should be modified to reflect a 1:1 part ratio between doughnuts and muffins. Given there are 50 doughnuts, the calculation changes to 50 x 1 = 50 for the number of muffins, which should ultimately modify the formula to 50 x 1 = 50. It should be noted that the calculation in step 3 maintains the error and refers incorrectly to '10 parts of muffins', as the initial step that created the incorrect carryover effect from the deletion is step 1, thus it is marked as the wrong_step. The transformed_solution erroneously states that there are 100 muffins due to incorrectly maintaining the original step 4 calculation without adjusting for the altered quantity suggested by the deleted step 1 (10 parts was used instead of the correct 1 part, leading to multiplying by 10 instead of 1).",

The formula used in the transformed solution step 1 is (100 - 20) * (100 - 10) / 100 which equals to 72, not calculating the total decrease percentage directly but resulting in the final value instead. In step 2, it mistakenly subtracts 72 from 100, which would imply that the card was somehow back to its original value and then decreased by 28% in two steps which does not make sense. The result of step 2 of the transformed solution should have been a reduced value, not a percentage. This has led to a transformed answer of 72, which is the percentage of the value remaining after the decreases, not the total percent decrease which is asked in the question, resulting in an incorrect transformed_answer.

The calculation should be: (100 - 20) * (100 - 10) / 100 = 80 * 90 / 100 = 72. Then, to find the total percent decrease, we subtract the final percentage (72) from the original (100), which gives us 100 - 72 = 28. The correct total percent decrease is 28%.",

Step 1 of the original_solution originally involved adding the individual percentages of length and breadth reduction and also including the combined effect of the reductions. However, after deletion, the transformed_solution incorrectly only takes the product of the two percentage reductions (20% x 20%), which actually represents the combined effect, not the entire decrease in area. The combined effect has been mistaken for the total decrease in area, resulting in a calculation that only considers the intersection of the length and breadth reductions. The transformed_solution, therefore, does not add the individual percentage reductions of length and breadth, hence arriving at an incorrect answer of 4%.

Thus, the new area is 0.8 times the length times 0.8 times the breadth, which is 0.64 times the original area. The decrease in area is 1 - 0.64 = 0.36, or 36%."

As a result, the subtraction operation in step 4 is incorrect, but it still reveals that the equation 2x - 780 = 2x + 780 cannot hold true unless the extra bananas (780) is balanced out by an equal amount on the other side of the equation (-780 = 780). Hence, in step 5, instead of equating -780 to 390, it should equate -780 to 780 to maintain this balance.
