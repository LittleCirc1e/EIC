        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly finds the values of b and c by solving the system of equations derived from f(1) = 0 and f(-8) = 0. The value of b is found to be 9, and the value of c is found to be -10. The function f(x) crosses the y-axis at the point where x = 0, which is the constant term c in the quadratic equation. Since c = -10, the y-coordinate where f(x) crosses the y-axis is indeed -10. Therefore, the solution is correct."

Its subsequent related steps will be affected, but the calculation of the step related to the error will still be correct.

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly solves the absolute value equation |20x - 10| = 110 by considering both cases when the expression inside the absolute value is positive and when it is negative. The solution finds the two possible values of x, which are 6.5 and -5, and then correctly calculates the product of these two values as -32.5. Therefore, the solution is correct."
