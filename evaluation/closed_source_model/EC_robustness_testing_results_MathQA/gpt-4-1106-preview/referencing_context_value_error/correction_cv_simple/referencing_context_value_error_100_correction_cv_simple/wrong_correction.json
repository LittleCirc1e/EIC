Each step that requires the sum of the numbers still references the number 20 correctly, except for the step referenced incorrectly.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Let the two numbers be x and y.\nAccording to the given conditions, we have x + y = 20 and 2x = 3y + 5.\nFrom the first equation, we get x = 20 - y.\nSubstitute the value of x in the second equation: 2(20 - y) = 3y + 5\n40 - 2y = 3y + 5\n40 - 5 = 3y + 2y\n35 = 5y\ny = 7\nSubstitute the value of y in x + y = 20 to find x: x + 7 = 20\nx = 13\nThe two numbers are 13 and 7.",
        "corrected_answer": "13,7",
        "corrected_explanation": "The sum of the two numbers should be 20, not 25. The first equation should be x + y = 20. After correcting this, the solution process leads to the correct numbers, which are 13 and 7."
