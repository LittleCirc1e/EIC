        "explanation": "In step 2 of the original_solution, the total days are erroneously counted as 6 instead of 7 when calculating the total rainfall for the week. This affects the following steps since the total rainfall is now incorrectly set to 18 cm instead of 21 cm. Consequently, the calculation is based on the wrong total, which also changes the final answer for Tuesday’s rainfall from 10.5 cm to 9 cm.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "corrected_solution": "none",
        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly sets up an equation where x represents the rainfall on Tuesday. It correctly calculates the total rainfall for the week as 6 days * 3 cm/day = 18 cm. It then sets up the equation x = 18 - x, where 18 cm is the total weekly rainfall and x is the rainfall on Tuesday, which is equal to the sum of the rainfall on the other days. Solving this equation gives x = 9 cm, which is the correct amount of rainfall on Tuesday."
