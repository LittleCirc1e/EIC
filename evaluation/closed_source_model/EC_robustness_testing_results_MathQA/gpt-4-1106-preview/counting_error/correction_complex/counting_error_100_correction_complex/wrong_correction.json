        "corrected_answer": "2/7",
        "corrected_explanation": "The original solution did not consider that there are two extra days in a leap year, not just one. Since the year can start on any day of the week, and the two extra days are consecutive, there are two scenarios where there can be 53 Mondays: if the year starts on a Monday, or if it starts on a Sunday (with the extra day being a Monday).
