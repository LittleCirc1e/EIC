        "question": "How to resolve this question: second saturday and every sunday is a holiday. How many working days will be there in a month of 30 days beginning on a Saturday?",
        "original_solution": "In a month of 30 days, there will be 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays\nThe second Saturday and every Sunday are holidays, so there will be 2 Saturdays and 4 Sundays off\nTherefore, the total number of working days will be 30 - 2(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 24 days\n#### 24",
        "original_answer": 24,
        "transformed_solution": "In a month of 30 days, there will be 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays\nThe second Saturday and every Sunday are holidays, so there will be 3 Saturdays and 4 Sundays off\nTherefore, the total number of working days will be 30 - 3(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 23 days\n#### 23",
        "transformed_answer": 23,
        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 incorrectly increases the number of Saturdays off from 2 to 3. The wrong step caused an overcounting error in the number of holidays (Saturdays off), and it further impacts the calculation in step 3, changing it from 30 - 2(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 24 to 30 - 3(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 23. This is the step where the counting error is made, and the other steps remain correctly calculated based on the progression of the transformed_solution, leading to a transformed_answer of 23 days which differs from the original_answer.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "In a month of 30 days, there will be 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays\nThe second Saturday and every Sunday are holidays, so there will be 1 Saturday and 4 Sundays off\nTherefore, the total number of working days will be 30 - 1(Saturday) - 4(Sundays) = 25 days\n#### 25",
        "corrected_answer": 25.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "Step 2 first erroneously counts the number of Saturdays off as 3 instead of 1, since only the second Saturday is a holiday. The correct number of Saturdays off is 1, and the correct number of Sundays off is 4, leading to a total of 5 days off. Therefore, the total number of working days is 30 - 5 = 25."

        "question": "John had a stock of 1300 books in his bookshop. He sold 75 on Monday, 50 on Tuesday, 64 on Wednesday, 78 on Thursday and 135 on Friday. What percentage of the books were not sold?",
        "original_solution": "The total number of books sold is 75 + 50 + 64 + 78 + 135 = 402 books\nThe number of books not sold is 1300 - 402 = 898 books\nThe percentage of books not sold is (898 / 1300) * 100 = 69%\n#### 69",
        "original_answer": 69,
        "transformed_solution": "The total number of books sold is 75 + 50 + 64 + 78 + 120 = 387 books\nThe number of books not sold is 1300 - 387 = 913 books\nThe percentage of books not sold is (913 / 1300) * 100 = 70.231%\n#### 70.231",

        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In step 1 of the transformed_solution, the number of books sold on Friday is mistakenly counted as 120 instead of the original number 135. This affects the calculation of the total number of books sold, the remainder not sold, and the respective percentage. The change from 135 to 120 has modified the subsequent steps without affecting the unrelated steps, resulting in a transformed answer of approximately 70.231% compared to the original answer of 69%.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "The total number of books sold is 75 + 50 + 64 + 78 + 135 = 402 books\nThe number of books not sold is 1300 - 402 = 898 books\nThe percentage of books not sold is (898 / 1300) * 100 = 69.077%\n#### 69.077",
        "corrected_answer": 69.077,
        "corrected_explanation": "Step 1 first makes a counting error by adding the number of books sold incorrectly, using 120 instead of 135 for Friday. The correct total number of books sold should be 402, not 387. This error affects the subsequent calculations."
