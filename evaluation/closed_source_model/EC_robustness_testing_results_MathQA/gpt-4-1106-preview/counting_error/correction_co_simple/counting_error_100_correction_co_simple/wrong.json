If the station is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, how many cars does Gary’s station serve over the course of a typical week?",
        "original_solution": "The station is open for 16 hours on Saturday and Sunday, and 16 * 5 = 80 hours on all other days\nOn Saturday, the station serves 13 * 16 = 208 cars\nOn Sunday, the station serves 10 * 16 = 160 cars\nOn all other days, the station serves 9 * 80 = 720 cars\nThe total number of cars served in a typical week is 208 + 160 + 720 = 1088 cars\n#### 1088",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 mistakenly counts the number of hours the station is open from Monday to Friday as 16 * 6 = 96 hours instead of 16 * 5 = 80 hours. This counting error also affects step 3, changing the calculation from 9 * 80 = 720 cars to 9 * 96 = 864 cars, and affects step 4, changing the total from 1088 cars to 1232 cars.

The sum of cars served each day is correctly added to find the total number of cars served in a typical week."

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution is correct. In a leap year, there are 366 days, which means there are 52 full weeks and 2 extra days. The probability that these 2 extra days include a Monday is 2/7, not 1/7, because there are 7 possible combinations of two consecutive days and only 2 of them include a Monday (Monday-Tuesday and Sunday-Monday). However, since the solution correctly calculates the probability of having at least one extra Monday (which is the same as having exactly one extra Monday in this case) as 1/7, the final answer is correct. The probability of getting 53 Mondays in a leap year is indeed 1/7 or approximately 0.1429."
