The correct total sum of temperatures should be calculated over 5 days, not 4. The maximum temperature that can be achieved while still having an average of 60 is by having the remaining 4 days at the average (60), which gives us a sum of 240 for those 4 days. The fifth day, to maximize the range, would use the remaining sum which is 300 - 50 = 250. Therefore, the maximum temperature for the fifth day is 250, and the range is 250 - 50 = 200."

        "explanation": "Here, step 3 erroneously counts the number of miles Julia ran as equal to the number of miles Bill ran on Sunday instead of twice. This causes step 3 to change from 2(x+4)=2x+8 to 1(x+4)=x+4, a counting error of the miles Julia ran. And it affects the subsequent related steps: step 4 is changed from 4x + 12 = 28 to 3x + 8 = 28, step 5 is changed from 4x = 16 to 3x = 20, step 6 is changed from x = 4 to x = 6.6667, and step 7, the conclusion, is changed from Bill ran 8 miles to Bill ran 10.6667 miles on Sunday.

After correcting this, the equation becomes 3x + 12 = 28, and solving for x gives us the correct number of miles Bill ran on Sunday."

        "question": "one week , a certain truck rental lot had a total of 26 trucks , all of which were on the lot monday morning . if 50 % of the trucks that were rented out during the week were returned to the lot on or before saturday morning of that week , and if there were at least 14 trucks on the lot that saturday morning , what is the greatest number of different trucks that could have been rented out during the week ?",
        "original_solution": "The total number of trucks rented out during the week is 26 - 14 = 12 trucks\nSince 50% of the rented out trucks were returned by Saturday morning, the total number of trucks rented out during the week is 12 / (50/100) = 24 trucks\n#### 24",
        "original_answer": 24,
        "transformed_solution": "The total number of trucks rented out during the week is 26 - 13 = 13 trucks\nSince 50% of the rented out trucks were returned by Saturday morning, the total number of trucks rented out during the week is 13 / (50/100) = 26 trucks\n#### 26",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 erroneously counts the trucks on the lot as being 13 instead of 14 on Saturday morning, resulting in the calculation being changed from 26 - 14 = 12 trucks to 26 - 13 = 13 trucks. And it affects the subsequent related step, changing the computed total number of trucks rented out during the week from 24 to 26. It should be noted that only one step of counting error is considered, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "The total number of trucks on the lot on Saturday morning is at least 14. Since 50% of the trucks that were rented out during the week were returned by Saturday morning, the number of trucks rented out and returned by Saturday morning is at least 14 - 13 = 1 truck. This means that at least 2 trucks were rented out during the week because 50% of those would be 1 truck. To maximize the number of different trucks that could have been rented out during the week, we assume that all the trucks on the lot on Saturday morning were rented out and returned. Therefore, the greatest number of different trucks that could have been rented out during the week is 14 * 2 = 28 trucks.",
        "corrected_answer": 28,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly subtracts 13 from 26 to find the number of trucks rented out during the week. Instead, we should consider that at least 14 trucks are on the lot on Saturday morning, which means at least 14 trucks were rented and returned. Since this is 50% of the trucks rented out, we double the number to find the total number of different trucks that could have been rented out, which is 28."
