The conversion of kmph to m/s is also correct, using the factor of 5/18. Finally, the time taken to pass the man is correctly calculated by dividing the length of the train by the relative speed in m/s. The final answer of 30 seconds is correct."

As a result of changing the factor count, an incorrect number of trailing zeros was presented – three instead of two.

        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution is correct. The number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of pairs of prime factors 2 and 5, since 10 is made up of 2 and 5. In 10!, there are more 2s than 5s, so the number of zeros is determined by the number of 5s. There is one 5 in each of 5, 10, so there are two 5s, and since 10 is 2*5, it contributes one more 5, making a total of three 5s. Therefore, 10! has three trailing zeros."
