        "explanation": "This example contains a miscalculation in step 2 where 0.9y/0.45 is calculated as 1.8y instead of the correct 2y. Subsequent steps are affected since they use the result of this wrong step. Step 3 remains unchanged because it does not depend on the result from step 2. Step 4, however, uses the wrong result 1.8y instead of 2y, so the equation 2(0.75x) is replaced with 1.8(0.75x), resulting in 1.35x instead of the correct 1.5x. This leads to the final incorrect statement that z is 135% of x instead of 150%. It is important that the formula in step 4 inherits and uses the erroneous result from step 2, yet the process of multiplication is carried out correctly based on the incorrect input.",
