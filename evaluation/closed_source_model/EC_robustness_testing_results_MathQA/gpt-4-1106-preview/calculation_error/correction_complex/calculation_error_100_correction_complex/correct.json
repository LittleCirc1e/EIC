The relative speed should first be converted from kmph to m/s by multiplying by (5/18), and then multiplied by the time in seconds to find the distance. The correct calculation is 144 kmph * (5/18) to convert to m/s, which gives 40 m/s, and then 40 m/s * 33 seconds to get the distance, which is 1320 meters.
