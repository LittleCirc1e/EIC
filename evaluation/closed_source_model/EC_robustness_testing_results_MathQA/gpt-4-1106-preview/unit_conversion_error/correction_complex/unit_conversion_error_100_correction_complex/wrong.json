        "question": "a clock shows the time as 12 a . m . if the minute hand gains 5 minutes every hour , how many minutes will the clock gain by 6 p . m . ?",
        "original_solution": "From 12 a.m. to 6 p.m. is a total of 6 hours.\n6 hours * 5 minutes gained per hour = 30 minutes gained by the clock.\n#### 30",
        "original_answer": 30.0,
        "transformed_solution": "From 12 a.m. to 6 p.m. is a total of 18 hours.\n18 hours * 5 minutes gained per hour = 90 minutes gained by the clock.\n#### 90",
        "transformed_answer": 90.0,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means the time interval is wrongly calculated as 18 hours instead of the actual 6-hour duration from 12 a.m. to 6 p.m., resulting in 6 hours * 5 minutes gained per hour = 30 minutes gained by the clock in the original_solution becoming 18 hours * 5 minutes gained per hour = 90 minutes gained by the clock in the transformed_solution. This resulted in a change in both the transformed_solution and the transformed_answer. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, and the multiplication process of step 2 is still correct.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "corrected_solution": "none",
        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the total time from 12 a.m. to 6 p.m. as 18 hours. It then correctly multiplies the 18 hours by the 5 minutes gained each hour to find the total minutes gained by the clock, which is 90 minutes. Therefore, the solution is correct."
