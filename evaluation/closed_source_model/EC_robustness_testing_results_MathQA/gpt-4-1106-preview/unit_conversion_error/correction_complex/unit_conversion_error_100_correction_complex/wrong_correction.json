        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 3 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 15 minutes is wrongly converted to 15/50 hours instead of 15/60 hours. This results in the incorrect conversion of 15 minutes to 3/10 hours in the transformed_solution instead of the correct 1/4 hours in the original_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 5. The new equation becomes S × (T + 3/10) = (6/7)S × T, which when solved gives T = 9/5 hours instead of the correct 3/2 hours. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, so the equations and calculation processes before and after step 3 are still correct.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly converts 15 minutes to hours as 15/50 instead of the correct conversion 15/60. The correct conversion is 15 minutes = 15/60 hours = 1/4 hours. The equation should be set up as S × T = (6/7)S × (T + 1/4). Solving this equation correctly gives T = 7/4 hours or 1.75 hours."

        "question": "A leak in the bottom of a tank can empty the full tank in 6 hours. An inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute. When the tank is full, the inlet is opened and due to the leak, the tank is empty in 12 hours. How many litres does the cistern hold?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the capacity of the tank in litres.\nThe inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute, so in 12 hours it fills 6 * 12 * 60 = 4320 litres.\nThe leak can empty the tank in 6 hours, so in 12 hours it can empty 2x litres.\nNow, 4320 - 2x = x. Solving for x, we get x = 4320.\n#### 4320",
        "original_answer": 4320.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the capacity of the tank in litres.\nThe inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute, so in 12 hours it fills 6 * 12 * 50 = 3600 litres.\nThe leak can empty the tank in 6 hours, so in 12 hours it can empty 2x litres.\nNow, 3600 - 2x = x.

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means that 1 hour wrongly has 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes, resulting in 6 * 12 * 60 = 4320 litres in the original_solution becoming 6 * 12 * 50 = 3600 litres in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 4, which changes from 4320 - 2x = x to 3600 - 2x = x and the solution from x = 4320 to x = 3600 / 3 = 1200 litres for the capacity of the tank.

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution made a mistake in the calculation of the total amount of water the inlet pipe can fill in 12 hours. It should be 6 litres per minute times 60 minutes per hour times 12 hours, which equals 4320 litres, not 3600. The correct equation is 4320 - 2x = x, and solving for x gives us 1440 litres, not 1200."
