        "original_solution": "20 typists can type 44 letters in 20 minutes.\nSo, 1 typist can type 44/20 = 2.2 letters in 20 minutes.\nIn 1 hour, 1 typist can type 2.2 x 3 = 6.6 letters.\nSo, 30 typists working at the same rate can type 30 x 6.6 = 198 letters in 1 hour.\n#### 198",
        "original_answer": 198.0,
        "transformed_solution": "20 typists can type 44 letters in 20 minutes.\nSo, 1 typist can type 44/20 = 2.2 letters in 20 minutes.\nIn 1 hour, 1 typist can type 2.2 x 2 = 4.4 letters.\nSo, 30 typists working at the same rate can type 30 x 4.4 = 132 letters in 1 hour.\n#### 132",

        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 3 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 hour is wrongly assumed to have 40 minutes instead of 60 minutes, resulting in '2.2 x 3 = 6.6 letters' in the original_solution becoming '2.2 x 2 = 4.4 letters' in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 4, which changes from '30 x 6.6 = 198 letters' to '30 x 4.4 = 132 letters'. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, and the other calculation processes are still correct, maintaining consistency with the presented cases.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the number of letters 1 typist can type in 20 minutes, then correctly scales it up to 1 hour, and finally multiplies by 30 typists to find the total number of letters typed in 1 hour."

        "question": "a clock shows the time as 12 a . m . if the minute hand gains 5 minutes every hour , how many minutes will the clock gain by 6 p . m . ?",
        "original_solution": "From 12 a.m. to 6 p.m. is a total of 6 hours.\n6 hours * 5 minutes gained per hour = 30 minutes gained by the clock.\n#### 30",

        "transformed_solution": "From 12 a.m. to 6 p.m. is a total of 18 hours.\n18 hours * 5 minutes gained per hour = 90 minutes gained by the clock.\n#### 90",
