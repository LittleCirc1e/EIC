        "original_solution": "First, let's convert the speed of the train from km/minute to m/second. 12 km in 10 minutes is 12 km / 10 minutes = 1.2 km/minute = 1.2 km/minute * 1000 m/km / 60 seconds/hour = 20 m/second.\nThe length of the train is the distance it travels in the 6 seconds it takes to pass the telegraph post, so length = speed * time = 20 m/second * 6 seconds = 120 meters.\n#### 120",

To convert km/minute to m/second, we use the conversion 1 km = 1000 m and 1 minute = 60 seconds. So, 1.2 km/minute = 1.2 * 1000 m / (10 * 60) seconds = 1200 m / 600 seconds = 2 m/second.\nThe length of the train is the distance it travels in the 6 seconds it takes to pass the telegraph post, so length = speed * time = 2 m/second * 6 seconds = 12 meters.",
