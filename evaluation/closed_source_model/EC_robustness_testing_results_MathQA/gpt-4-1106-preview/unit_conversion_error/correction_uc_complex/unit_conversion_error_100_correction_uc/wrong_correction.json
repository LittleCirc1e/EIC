        "question": "A searchlight on top of the watchtower makes 4 revolutions per minute. What is the probability that a man appearing near the tower will stay in the dark for at least 12 seconds?",
        "original_solution": "To find the probability, we need to first calculate the time it takes for 4 revolutions.\nThere are 60 seconds in a minute, so the time for 4 revolutions is 60 seconds / 4 = 15 seconds.\nThis means that the searchlight completes 4 revolutions in 15 seconds. To stay in the dark for at least 12 seconds, the man must arrive during the 3 seconds of light.\nThe probability of the man staying in the dark for at least 12 seconds is 3 seconds / 15 seconds = 1/5.\n#### 1/5",

        "transformed_solution": "To find the probability, we need to first calculate the time it takes for 4 revolutions.\nThere are 50 seconds in a minute, so the time for 4 revolutions is 50 seconds / 4 = 12.5 seconds.\nThis means that the searchlight completes 4 revolutions in 12.5 seconds. To stay in the dark for at least 12 seconds, the man must arrive during the 0.5 seconds of light.\nThe probability of the man staying in the dark for at least 12 seconds is 0.5 seconds / 12.5 seconds = 1/25.\n#### 1/25",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 minute is wrongly equal to 50 seconds instead of 60 seconds, resulting in 60 seconds / 4 = 15 seconds in the original_solution becoming 50 seconds / 4 = 12.5 seconds in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 4, which changes from 3 seconds / 15 seconds = 1/5 to 0.5 seconds / 12.5 seconds = 1/25. The transformed_answer is therefore 1/25 or 0.04, which is different from the original_answer.

This affects the subsequent steps. The correct calculation is 60 seconds for a full minute divided by 4 revolutions, which equals 15 seconds per revolution. Therefore, the probability of staying in the dark for at least 12 seconds is the complement of the time spent in light, which is 12 seconds in the dark out of 15 seconds total, resulting in a probability of 12/15 or 4/5."
