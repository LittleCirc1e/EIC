        "explanation": "This example turns the addition in step 1 into subtraction, and by changing + to -, 0.5 - 0.5x + 0.2x = 0.4 becomes 0.5 - 0.5x - 0.2x = 0.4. This affects the subsequent related step 2. Step 2 now becomes incorrect because the term 0.2x should have been subtracted from -0.5x, but instead, it was mistakenly left as addition in the transformed solution. Therefore, the new equation after the incorrect transformation should have been 0.5 - 0.7x = 0.4, leading to -0.7x = -0.1 and x = -0.1/-0.7, which is approximately 0.14286. Hence, the explanation should reflect that an addition was incorrectly transformed into a subtraction in step 1, but the transformed solution did not correctly calculate the resultant change.",

        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly sets up an equation to represent the mixture of two solutions with different intensities to achieve a final intensity. The initial intensity of the paint is 50% (0.5), and an unknown fraction 'x' of this paint is replaced with a 20% (0.2) intensity paint. The equation 0.5 - 0.5x + 0.2x = 0.4 correctly represents the situation where the sum of the remaining 50% intensity paint and the added 20% intensity paint equals the final intensity of 40%. Solving for 'x' gives 0.3x = 0.1, and x = 0.1 / 0.3, which simplifies to x = 1/3 or 0.33333. This is the correct fraction of the original paint that was replaced."
