        "corrected_explanation": "Step 2 incorrectly adds the number of students who took the exam on the assigned day to the total number of students to get 153, which is not possible as the class has only 90 students. The correct calculation is to subtract the number of students who took the exam on the assigned day from the total number of students to get the number of students who took the make-up exam, which is 90 - 63 = 27. The total score for the class is then calculated by adding the total scores of both groups and dividing by the total number of students. The final average score is 63%, not 161%."

This is a misguided application of the original principle that the number of monkeys and bananas doesn't change the rate of consumption per monkey. Only step 2 contains the introduced error, but its result is calculated correctly based on the incorrect operation.
