        "corrected_solution": "Let the numbers be 3x, 4x, and 7x.\nThe product is 3x * 4x * 7x = 18144\n84x^3 = 18144\nx^3 = 18144 / 84\nx^3 = 216\nx = cbrt(216)\nx = 6\nThe numbers are 3x = 3*6, 4x = 4*6, and 7x = 7*6\nThe numbers are 18, 24, and 42.",
        "corrected_answer": "18, 24, 42",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly divided 4x by 7x instead of multiplying all three terms. The correct process is to multiply 3x, 4x, and 7x to get the product 84x^3, then solve for x by taking the cube root of 18144 divided by 84, which gives x = 6. Multiplying 3, 4, and 7 by 6 gives the correct numbers."
