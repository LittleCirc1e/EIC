        "corrected_answer": "0.96",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly calculates the area of the square q as 4x, which is actually the perimeter. The area of a square with side length x is x^2. Additionally, the final ratio calculation is incorrect. After finding the correct expressions for the areas of q and r, the ratio of the area of r to q should be calculated as 24/25x^2 / x^2, which simplifies to 24/25. The variable x^2 cancels out in the ratio, leaving a constant value."

However, the transformed solution replaces the formula for area with the formula for perimeter, resulting in an incorrect expansion of 2*((x+10) + x) = 144 instead of (x+10)*x = 144. This affects the subsequent related steps, changing the quadratics and their resolution to a linear equation and its resolution. Note that the language description of step 3 < The area of the field is given by > remains unchanged in the transformed_solution as < The perimeter of the field is given by >, causing the mistake by changing the formula used without modifying the descriptive text.

        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly uses the formula for the perimeter of the rectangle to find the width and length, when it should use the formula for the area. The correct process is to set up the equation for the area of the rectangle (length * width), which leads to a quadratic equation. Solving this quadratic equation gives the width, and adding 10 to the width gives the length."
