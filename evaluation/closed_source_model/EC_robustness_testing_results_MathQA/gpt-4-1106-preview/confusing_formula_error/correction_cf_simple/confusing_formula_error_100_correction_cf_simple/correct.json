This confusion changes the subsequent step 4 from 4*L*W - L*W = 3*L*W to 4L+4W - (2L+2W) = 2L+2W and also affects the final percentage calculation in step 5, changing it from (3*L*W)/(L*W) * 100% = 300% to ((2L+2W)/(2L+2W)) * 100% = 100%.

The question requires that the area of the triangle to be solved be equal to 0.5 multiplied by the base multiplied by the height, rather than summing up the lengths of the three sides and dividing by 2, which is equivalent to the semi-perimeter of the triangle.
