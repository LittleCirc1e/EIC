        "explanation": "In this case, step 2 confuses the area calculation of a face of the cube with the perimeter calculation. Instead of using the area formula s^2 for each face, it incorrectly uses the perimeter formula 4s (s+s+s+s), resulting in a transformed solution where the total area is incorrectly calculated as 24s for the entire cube, and 8s for the two white-painted faces specifically. The ratio then is incorrectly derived as 2s^2 (the area of the red-painted faces which remains unchanged) to 8s (the modified incorrect total of the white faces), which simplifies to 1:4. This alters the final ratio but keeps the language description of calculations unchanged as per the instructions given.

        "corrected_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 confuses the formula for the perimeter of a square (4*s) with the formula for the area of a square (s^2). The total area of the cube should be calculated using the area formula for a square, which is 6*s^2, not 24s. The area of the white-painted faces should also be calculated using the area formula, which is 2*s^2, not 8s. The corrected total white area includes both the area of the two completely white faces and the white halves of the four partially painted faces, which is 4s^2.
