This also affects the calculation in step 4, changing the answer from 24/7 hours to 24/5 hours to complete the job working together. The transformed_answer is different from the original_answer as a result of adding additional information into the existing step.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Worker A can complete 1/8 of the job in 1 hour.\nWorker B can complete 1/6 of the job in 1 hour.\nTogether, they can complete 1/8 + 1/6 of the job in 1 hour.\nTo combine their work rates, find a common denominator, which is 24.\nSo, Worker A's rate is 3/24 and Worker B's rate is 4/24.\nTogether, they complete 3/24 + 4/24 = 7/24 of the job in 1 hour.\nTo find out how long it takes for them to complete the job, calculate the reciprocal of 7/24.\nIt takes them 24/7 hours to complete the job working together.\nTherefore, it takes them 24/7 hours to complete the job.",
        "corrected_answer": 3.43,
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly subtracted 1/4 from the combined work rate to account for a break. However, the question does not specify that the break time should be subtracted from the work rate. The correct approach is to add the rates of Worker A and Worker B without subtracting break time unless it is explicitly stated in the problem. The combined work rate is 1/8 + 1/6 = 3/24 + 4/24 = 7/24. The time to complete the job is the reciprocal of the combined work rate, which is 24/7 hours or approximately 3.43 hours."
