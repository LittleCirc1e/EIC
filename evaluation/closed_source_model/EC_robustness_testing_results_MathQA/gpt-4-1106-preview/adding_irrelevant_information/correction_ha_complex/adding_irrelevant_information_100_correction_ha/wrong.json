        "original_answer": 76.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Assuming that there is an error where we incorrectly subtracted an additional $8 that is not part of the problem statement,\nLet the numbers be x, x+2, x+4, and x+6\nThe sum is x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) = 4x + 12\n4x + 12 - 8 (incorrectly subtracting $8) = 292\n4x + 4 = 292\n4x = 288\nx = 72\nThe largest number is 72+6 = 78\n#### 78",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 3 adds an incorrect subtraction of $8 that is not mentioned in the question statement, resulting in step 3 changing from 4x + 12 = 292 to 4x + 12 - 8 = 292, which adjusts the equation solving process. The error affects the computed value of x and consequently the final result for the largest number, which changes from x + 6 = 76 in the original_solution to x + 6 = 78 in the transformed_solution.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "corrected_solution": "none",
        "corrected_answer": "none",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly identifies the four consecutive even numbers as x, x+2, x+4, and x+6. It then correctly sets up the equation for their sum as 4x + 12 and solves for x to find the smallest number. The solution then correctly adds 6 to the smallest number to find the largest number. The mention of incorrectly subtracting $8 is irrelevant information, but it does not affect the final result, as the solution does not actually subtract $8 in the calculations. Therefore, the final answer of 78 is correct."
