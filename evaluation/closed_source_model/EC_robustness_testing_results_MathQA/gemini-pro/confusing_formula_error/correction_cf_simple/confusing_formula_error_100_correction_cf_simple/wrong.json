        "original_solution": "Let the original length of the rectangle be L and the original width be W\nAfter a 20% increase, the new length becomes 1.2L and the new width becomes 1.2W\nThe original area is L*W and the new area is 1.2L*1.2W=1.44LW\nThe increase in area is 1.44LW - LW = 0.44LW\nTo find the percentage increase, we divide the increase by the original area and multiply by 100\nSo the percentage increase is (0.44LW / LW) * 100 = 44%\n#### 44%",

        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the area with the perimeter. The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than twice the sum of the length and width, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle. This results in the formula for the original area in the original_solution (L*W) being replaced with a formula for the original perimeter (2*(L+W)) in the transformed_solution. Subsequently, the increase in perimeter is incorrectly calculated instead of the increase in area, impacting the transformed_answer. Note that the language descriptions for steps 3 and 4 in the original_solution remain unchanged in the transformed_solution, although the formulas used for calculations are incorrect only for step 3, while step 5 correctly calculates the percentage based on the modified step 4.
