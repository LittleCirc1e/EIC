        "corrected_explanation": "The mistake in the original solution is in the first equation. The perimeter of a rectangle is 2L + 2W, not L + L + W + W. This error leads to the incorrect equation 150 = 300, which is then used to solve for W. The correct equation should be 600 / W + 2W = 70, which leads to the correct answer of W = 10 meters."

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The confusion here is between the formula for the area of a triangle with two sides and an included angle and the perimeter formula of a triangle. The original solution correctly uses the area formula which includes trigonometric functions. The transformed solution incorrectly attempts to find a 'perimeter' by naively adding the two given sides with an assumed third side, which is improperly taken as half of one of the sides assuming a right triangle, which is not given in the problem. This confuses the concept of area with perimeter and also brings in an unrelated concept of a right triangle within an obtuse triangle. Note that the language description of step 1 < First, use the formula to find the area > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. The error affects the conclusion of the problem, changing the original answer from an area to a 'perimeter' measurement, despite perimeter not being relevant to the original question.",
