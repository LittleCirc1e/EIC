        "corrected_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 4. Step 4 confuses the perimeter and area formulas of triangle and it should calculate the area of the triangle which is equal to the base multiplied by height divided by 2, rather than the base plus height plus hypotenuse, equivalent to the perimeter of the triangle. That means, it should calculate (3 * 4) / 2 = 6 square units instead of (3 + 4 + 5) = 12 units. Step 5, as the subsequent step of step 4, references the wrong result of step 4, resulting in the incorrect final answer."

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the area formula of a triangle with a sum operation. Instead of calculating the area using the correct formula (1/2) * base * height, the transformed_solution inaccurately uses a simple addition of base and height, which is not a formula for any geometrical measurement, resulting in the wrong calculation of 4 + 5 = 9 square meters. This is the first step in the transformed_solution, and no subsequent steps are present to be affected. This approach reflects a single error in the solution process where the description remains unchanged—the formula for calculating the area, however, is incorrectly transformed while the arithmetic operation based on the wrong formula is performed correctly.",
