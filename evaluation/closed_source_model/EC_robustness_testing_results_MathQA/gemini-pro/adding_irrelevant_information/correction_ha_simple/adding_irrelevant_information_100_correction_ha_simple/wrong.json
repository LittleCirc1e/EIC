        "original_solution": "a paid 12 x 8 = 96 horse-months of rent\nb paid 16 x 9 = 144 horse-months of rent\nc paid 18 x 6 = 108 horse-months of rent\nThe total is 96 + 144 + 108 = 348 horse-months of rent\nC should pay 957 / 348 = 2.75 rs per horse-month\nC should pay 18 x 6 x 2.75 = 297 rs\n#### 297",
        "original_answer": 297.0,
        "transformed_solution": "a paid 12 x 8 = 96 horse-months of rent\nb paid 16 x 9 = 144 horse-months of rent\nc initially paid for 18 x 6 but due to price increase in feed, the cost per horse month increased by 1 rs, so c paid 18 x 6 x (2.75 + 1) = 18 x 6 x 3.75 = 405 rs\nThe total is 96 + 144 + 108 = 348 horse-months of rent\nC should actually pay 957 - (96 + 144) x 2.75 + 405 = 957 - 660 + 405 = 702 rs\n#### 702",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 3 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement, that due to a price increase in feed, the cost per horse month for c increased by 1 rs. This error modifies the cost calculation for c's share from 18 x 6 x 2.75 = 297 rs to 18 x 6 x (2.75 + 1) = 18 x 6 x 3.75 = 405 rs. The total payment by c, therefore, changes from 297 rs in the original_solution to 702 rs due to the addition of the extra 1 rs per horse-month cost.",
