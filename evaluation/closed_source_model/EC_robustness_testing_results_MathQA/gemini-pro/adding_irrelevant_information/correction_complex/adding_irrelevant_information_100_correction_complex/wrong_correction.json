        "original_solution": "The annual population increase is 10000 x 20% = 2000\nThe population after 1 year is 10000 + 2000 = 12000\nThe population after 2 years is 12000 + 2400 = 14400\n#### 14400",
        "original_answer": 14400.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The annual population increase is 10000 x 20% = 2000\nThe population after 1 year is 10000 + 2000 = 12000\nAssuming there is an additional annual influx of 100 people due to migration, the population after 2 years is 12000 + 2400 + 100 = 14500\n#### 14500",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 3 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <Assuming there is an additional annual influx of 100 people due to migration>, resulting in step 3 changing from 12000 + 2400 = 14400 in the original_solution to 12000 + 2400 + 100 = 14500 in the transformed_solution. The extra 100 people represent an annual influx due to migration that affects the final population count after 2 years, thus completing the modification process required to transform the solution.",

        "corrected_answer": 14000.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "Step 3 makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 12000 + 2400 + 100 = 14500 instead of 12000 + 2000 = 14000, resulting in the final incorrect answer."
