        "question": "28 buckets of water fill a tank when the capacity of each bucket is 13.5 litres. How many buckets will be required to fill the same tank if the capacity of each bucket is 9 litres?",
        "original_solution": "The total capacity filled by 28 buckets = 28 x 13.5 = 378 litres\nThe capacity of each bucket to fill the same tank = 9 litres\nNumber of buckets required = 378 / 9 = 42\n#### 42",
        "original_answer": 42.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total capacity filled by 28 buckets = 28 x 13.5 = 385 litres\nThe capacity of each bucket to fill the same tank = 9 litres\nNumber of buckets required = 385 / 9 = 42.77\n#### 42.77",
        "transformed_answer": 42.77,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this example, the calculation in step 1 (28 x 13.5) has been incorrectly modified to equal 385 instead of the correct 378. This introduces a calculation error that carries through to step 3, where the number of buckets required to fill the same tank is now based on the incorrect total capacity of 385 litres. Note that we divide 385 by 9 to get an incorrect transformed_answer of 42.77 buckets, which maintains the correct mathematical operation but with an incorrect value inherited from step 1. Steps that do not depend on the miscalculated total capacity remain unaffected.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "The total capacity filled by 28 buckets = 28 x 13.5 = 385 litres\nThe capacity of each bucket to fill the same tank = 9 litres\nNumber of buckets required = 385 / 9 = 42.77777777777778\n#### 42.77777777777778",
        "corrected_answer": 42.77777777777778,
        "corrected_explanation": "The final answer should be rounded to the nearest integer, which is 43."
