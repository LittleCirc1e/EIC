        "question": "A towel, when bleached, lost 20% of its length and 20% of its breadth. What is the percentage decrease in area?",
        "original_solution": "The area of the towel is decreased by 36% because 20% + 20% + (20% x 20%) = 36%\n#### 36%",
        "original_answer": 36.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The area of the towel is decreased by 44% because 20% + 20% + (20% x 20%) = 44%\n#### 44%",
        "transformed_answer": 44.0,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "By randomly changing the calculation result of one step in the original_solution, the percentage decrease of area was incorrectly altered to 44% instead of the correct 36%. This was done by directly changing the total percentage value without modifying the operands or the operators. The subsequent related steps and the final transformed_answer are influenced by this new incorrect percentage.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "The area of the towel is decreased by 36% because 1 - (1 - 20%)(1 - 20%) = 36%\n#### 36%",
        "corrected_answer": 36.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "Step 1 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 20% + 20% + (20% x 20%) = 44% instead of 1 - (1 - 20%)(1 - 20%) = 36%, resulting in the final incorrect answer."
