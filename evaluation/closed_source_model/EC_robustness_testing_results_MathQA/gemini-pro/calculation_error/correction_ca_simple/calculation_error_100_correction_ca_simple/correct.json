This is a calculation error that does not affect the previous step, which correctly lists the multiples of 9. Since the subsequent step only includes concluding the count, it inherits this modified number, but the calculation to obtain that number is not shown and hence not affected in the steps provided. The previous steps of listing the multiples are correct and remain unchanged. The transformed answer differs from the original answer as a result of the mistaken count.",
