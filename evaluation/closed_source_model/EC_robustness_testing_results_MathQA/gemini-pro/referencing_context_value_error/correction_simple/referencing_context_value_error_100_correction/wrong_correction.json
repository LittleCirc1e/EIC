        "question": "A sports equipment store sold ping pong rackets for a total of $735. If the average (arithmetic mean) price of a pair of rackets is $9.8, how many pairs were sold?",
        "original_solution": "The number of pairs sold is the total sales divided by the price per pair, so 735 / 9.8 = 75.\n#### 75",
        "original_answer": 75.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The number of pairs sold is the total sales divided by the price per pair, so 735 / 9.5 = 77.36842105263158.\n#### 77.36842105263158",

        "corrected_solution": "The average price of a pair of rackets is $9.8, so the total sales can be calculated by multiplying the average price by the number of pairs sold. Therefore, the number of pairs sold is 735 / 9.8 = 74.9.\n#### 74.9",
