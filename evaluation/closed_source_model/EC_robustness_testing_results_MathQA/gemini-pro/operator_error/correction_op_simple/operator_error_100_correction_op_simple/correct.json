If the distance between their homes is 36 kilometers, Maxwell's walking speed is 3 km/h, and Brad's running speed is 6 km/h. What is the distance traveled by Maxwell when they meet in the middle?",
        "original_solution": "Let the time they meet be t hours.\nBrad's distance = 6t\nMaxwell's distance = 3t\nTotal distance = 36\n6t + 3t = 36\n9t = 36\nt = 4\nMaxwell's distance = 3 x 4 = 12\n#### 12",

        "explanation": "In this example, the addition in the original equation 6t + 3t = 36 was changed to subtraction, making it 6t - 3t = 36. The subtraction led to a new equation, 3t = 36, with t being incorrectly calculated to satisfy the incorrect equation. This results in a wrong time of t=12, which affects the subsequent calculation of Maxwell's distance. The correct calculation of step 5 becomes 3t = 36, giving t = 12, and step 6 then multiplies Maxwell’s speed by this incorrect time to get a final incorrect result of 36 kilometers. All other steps have been correctly calculated based on the modified values.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The error in the solution is in the equation 6t - 3t = 36. The correct equation should be 6t + 3t = 36, because Brad and Maxwell are walking towards each other, so the total distance they travel is the sum of their distances, not the difference."

This results in an impossible count of boys, calculated in step 2 as 160 - 320 = -160, which is not a feasible number of students.
