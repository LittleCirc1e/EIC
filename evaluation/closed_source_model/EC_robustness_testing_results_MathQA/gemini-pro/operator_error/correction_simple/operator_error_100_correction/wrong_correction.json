We are looking for the values of u such that the remainder r is 4.\nSo we can write 15 = u * q + 4, where q is an integer.\nRearranging this equation, we get u = (15 - 4) / q = 11 / q.\nSince u is an integer, q must be a divisor of 11.\nThe divisors of 11 are 1 and 11.\nTherefore, there are 2 values of u for which the equation is true.",
