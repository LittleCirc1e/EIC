This incorrect total distance affects the subsequent calculation of average speed, where 60 km is divided by the total time (which remains 2 hours correctly) to produce an average speed of 30 km/h.

This results in an impossible count of boys, calculated in step 2 as 160 - 320 = -160, which is not a feasible number of students.
