        "explanation": "This example turns the modulus operator in step 1 into multiplication, and by changing % to *, the expression 15 % u = 4 becomes 15 * u = 4. This changes the context and meaning of the problem and does not make sense as the question asks for a remainder of 4 when 15 is divided by u.

        "corrected_solution": "We are looking for the values of u that satisfy the equation 15 = 4 * u + r, where r is the remainder.\nWe know that r = 4, so we can rewrite the equation as 15 = 4 * u + 4.\nSolving for u, we get u = (15 - 4) / 4 = 11 / 4.\nSince u must be an integer, there are 0 values of u for which the equation is true.\n#### 0",
