        "explanation": "The change occurred in step 7 where the subtraction operator (-) was changed to an addition operator (+). Originally, 1000 - 100 + 0.025x - 0.05x = 600, was transformed to 1000 + 100 + 0.025x + 0.05x = 600. This led to the altered equation 0.025x + 0.05x = 600 - 1100, which distorted the final calculation into an incorrect total sales worth (x). The operator in step 7 is incorrect, and accordingly, its calculation is also incorrect, which directly affects the final result, leading to an incorrect transformed solution.

The mistake in the original solution is that it incorrectly calculates the difference between the new remuneration and the previous remuneration, resulting in a negative value for x. The corrected solution correctly calculates the difference and obtains a positive value for x, which represents the total sales worth."
