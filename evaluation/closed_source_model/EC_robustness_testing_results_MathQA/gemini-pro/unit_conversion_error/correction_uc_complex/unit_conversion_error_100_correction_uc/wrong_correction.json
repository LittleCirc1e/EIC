        "question": "if a child walks at the rate of 5 m / min from his home, he is 6 minutes late for school, if he walks at the rate of 7 m / min he reaches half an hour earlier. how far is his school from his home?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the distance from his home to the school.\nAccording to the given data, time = distance/speed.\nSo, x/5 + 6 = x/7 - 30\nMultiplying through by 35 to clear the fractions gives 7x + 210 = 5x - 1050.\nRearranging terms gives 2x = -1260, so x = -630.\nThe negative distance doesn't make sense in this context, so the child is 630 meters from his school.\n#### 630",
        "original_answer": 630.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the distance from his home to the school.\nAccording to the given data, time = distance/speed.\nSo, x/5 + 6 = x/7 - 20\nMultiplying through by 35 to clear the fractions gives 7x + 210 = 5x - 700.\nRearranging terms gives 2x = -910, so x = -455.\nThe negative distance doesn't make sense in this context, so the child is 455 meters from his school.\n#### 455",

        "wrong_step": 3,
        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 3 makes an incorrect unit conversion, which means the half an hour earlier arrival time is wrongly calculated as 20 minutes earlier (half an hour should be 30 minutes), resulting in x/7 - 30 in the original_solution becoming x/7 - 20 in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 4, which changes from 7x + 210 = 5x - 1050 to 7x + 210 = 5x - 700. Step 5 changes from 2x = -1260, so x = -630 to 2x = -910, so x = -455. The final correct distance remains positive; thus, the child is 455 meters from his school in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",

        "corrected_explanation": "Step 5 makes an incorrect unit conversion, mistakenly assuming that 2x=-910 instead of 2x=-910/2, and wrongly calculates x=-455 instead of x=-455/2. This affects the final answer."
