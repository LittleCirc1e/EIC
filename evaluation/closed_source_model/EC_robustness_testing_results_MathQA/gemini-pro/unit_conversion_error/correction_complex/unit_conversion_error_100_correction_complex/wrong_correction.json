        "question": "A light flashes every 20 seconds, how many times will it flash in 1/4 of an hour?",
        "original_solution": "There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 x 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.\nThe light flashes 3600 / 20 = 180 times in an hour.\n#### 180",
        "original_answer": 180.0,
        "transformed_solution": "There are 60 seconds in a minute and 50 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 x 50 = 3000 seconds in an hour.\nThe light flashes 3000 / 20 = 150 times in an hour.\n#### 150",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 hour is wrongly equal to 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes, resulting in 60 x 60 = 3600 seconds in the original_solution becoming 60 x 50 = 3000 seconds in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 2, which changes from 3600 / 20 = 180 times to 3000 / 20 = 150 times. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",

        "corrected_solution": "There are 60 seconds in a minute and 15 minutes in 1/4 of an hour, so there are 60 x 15 = 900 seconds in 1/4 of an hour.\nThe light flashes 900 / 20 = 45 times in 1/4 of an hour.\n#### 45",
        "corrected_answer": 45.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "Step 2 first makes a mistake in unit conversion and mistakenly believes that there are 50 minutes in an hour instead of 15 minutes in 1/4 of an hour, calculating 60 x 50 = 3000 instead of 60 x 15 = 900. The subsequent step 3 references the result of step 2, calculating 3000 / 20 = 150 instead of 900 / 20 = 45, resulting in the final incorrect answer."
