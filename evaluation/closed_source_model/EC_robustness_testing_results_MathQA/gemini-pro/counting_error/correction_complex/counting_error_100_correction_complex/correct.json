        "corrected_explanation": "Step 1 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 52 * 2 = 104 instead of 52 * 3 = 156. The subsequent step 2 references the result of step 1, calculating 54 * 3 = 162 instead of 54 * 3 = 162. The subsequent step 3 references the result of step 1, calculating 162 - 53 = 109 instead of 162 - 53 = 109. The subsequent step 4 references the result of step 1, calculating 104 - 109 = -5 instead of 156 - 109 = 47, resulting in the final incorrect answer."
