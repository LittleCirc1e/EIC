        "question": "if 8 workers can build 8 cars in 8 days, then how many days would it take 5 workers to build 5 cars?",
        "original_solution": "The number of workers and the number of cars are equal, so the same number of workers will take the same amount of time to build the same number of cars.\nTherefore, 5 workers will also take 8 days to build 5 cars.\n#### 8",
        "original_answer": 8.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The number of workers and the number of cars are equal, so the same number of workers will take the same amount of time to build the same number of cars.\nTherefore, 5 workers will also take 10 days to build 5 cars.\n#### 10",

        "explanation": "Step 2 mistakenly references 8 as 10 from step 1 and changes 'Therefore, 5 workers will also take 8 days to build 5 cars.' to 'Therefore, 5 workers will also take 10 days to build 5 cars.' It should be noted that step 1 in the transformed_solution <The number of workers and the number of cars are equal, so the same number of workers will take the same amount of time to build the same number of cars.> should be the same as the step 1 in the original_solution <The number of workers and the number of cars are equal, so the same number of workers will take the same amount of time to build the same number of cars.> and calculates its conclusion correctly. The error introduced at step 2 does not affect the wording of the rest of the solution but changes the final answer from 8 days to 10 days. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the logical structure of the explanation is still correct.",

        "corrected_solution": "The number of workers and the number of cars are not equal, so the same number of workers will not take the same amount of time to build the same number of cars.\nTherefore, 5 workers will take 16 days to build 5 cars.\n#### 16",
        "corrected_answer": 16.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "Step 1 erroneously states that the number of workers and the number of cars are equal, which leads to the incorrect conclusion that the same number of workers will take the same amount of time to build the same number of cars. This affects the calculation in step 2, resulting in an error in the final result."
