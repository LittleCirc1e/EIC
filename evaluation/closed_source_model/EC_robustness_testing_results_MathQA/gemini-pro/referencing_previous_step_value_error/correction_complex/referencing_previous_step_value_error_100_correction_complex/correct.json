        "original_solution": "Let the number of each type of coin be x.\nThe value of one rupee, 50 paise, and 25 paise coins is x, 0.5x, and 0.25x, respectively.\nSo, the total value is x + 0.5x + 0.25x = 210.\n1.75x = 210\nx = 120\nThere are 120 coins of each type.\n#### 120",
        "original_answer": 120,
        "transformed_solution": "Let the number of each type of coin be x.\nThe value of one rupee, 50 paise, and 25 paise coins is x, 0.5x, and 0.25x, respectively.\nSo, the total value is x + 0.5x + 0.25x = 210.\n1.75x = 200\nx = 200 / 1.75\nx = 114.29\nThere are 114 coins of each type.\n#### 114",

        "wrong_type": "referencing_previous_step_value_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references 210 as 200 from step 3 and changes 1.75x = 210 to 1.75x = 200. It should be noted that step 3 in the transformed_solution <So, the total value is x + 0.5x + 0.25x = 210.> should be the same as the step 3 in the original_solution <So, the total value is x + 0.5x + 0.25x = 210.> and calculates its result 210 correctly. However, in step 4 of the transformed_solution, the total value of 210 is incorrectly referenced as 200, leading to an incorrect calculation of x in subsequent steps. Step 5 and 6 still perform the calculations correctly as if step 4 was correct. You need only consider one error of referencing so that all other steps that reference this result number still reference it correctly. The transformed_answer should be different from the original_answer, which it is in this case.",

        "corrected_answer": 120.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The final answer should be 120 instead of 114.29, because in the last step, the calculation of x = 200 / 1.75 is incorrect. It should be x = 210 / 1.75."
