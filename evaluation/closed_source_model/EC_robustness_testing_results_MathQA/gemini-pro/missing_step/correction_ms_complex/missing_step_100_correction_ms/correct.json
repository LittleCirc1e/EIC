The original solution step 1 ('One cow will eat 20 bags of husk in 20 days') is erroneous and misguiding as it misses the logical representation of the sharing principle based on which the 20 bags of husk can feed 20 cows. In the transformed_solution, the unnecessary and confusing step 1 is removed and the correct reasoning is directly applied to establish how long it will take for one cow to eat one bag of husk. The calculation multiplies the total number of days (20) by the number of cows (20) to yield the correct number of days for one cow to eat one bag. Therefore, the transformed solution references the numerical values in the question correctly to arrive at a different (and in this case, correct) transformed answer, which is 400 days for one cow to eat one bag of husk by itself.",

How many games will be played in total?\nThe total number of games played is 15 x 14 / 2 = 105 because in a complete round-robin tournament, each team plays a game against every other team once, and we should not count the games where a team plays itself.\n#### 105",
        "corrected_answer": 105.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The first erroneous step is step 2, which calculates the total number of games played as 15 x 15 / 2 = 112.5. This is incorrect because it includes games where a team plays itself, which should not be counted. The correct calculation should be 15 x 14 / 2 = 105, which only includes games between different teams."
