Since there is no longer a step combining the amounts, the formula changes from 10+12=22 to just 12=12.

Therefore, as per the problem guidelines, I have chosen to slightly alter the price per pair used in the calculation from $9.8 to $10.

In the original_solution, step 1 states the formula for the area of a parallelogram and step 2 references both the base and the height from the question, multiplying them to find the area. Since we are deleting step 1, step 2 should still calculate the area but since we need a different answer, we reference the base for both the base and height, which is the largest number. Hence, we get 12 (base) x 12 (chosen number instead of the height) = 144 square cm. The calculation in step 2 after the transformation is using the incorrect formula but still internally consistent as a simple multiplication. It is the transformed step 1, which is also step 2 in the original_solution, that first references the incorrect number, in this case using the base (12) instead of the height (10).

By removing this step and because the solution involves a simple division, the solution should directly reference the number from the question. Since step 1 in the original_solution references the number 10 and there is no other number to choose from, in the transformed_solution, we directly divide by 1, pretending that a case can hold only 1 bottle, hence the total number of cases required would be 72000. This leads to a calculation of 72000 / 1 = 72000. The number 1 is the smallest default number for division when the actual divisor is omitted.

However, in the transformed solution, we retain the multiplication of the numbers but mistakenly keep only one factor of 25, instead of multiplying it by 15 to get the total. This results in an incorrect number of chocolate bars (25 instead of 375). The erroneous result is carried on from the first step, making it the wrong_step.
