In the original_solution, step 1 references the natural numbers 1 and 3 from the statement that their product is 3, and step 2 references the results of step 1. After deleting step 1, step 2 should reference the number 3 from the question instead, resulting in the incorrect assumption that both natural numbers are 3, which leads to the incorrect reciprocal of 1/9 + 1/9 instead of 1 + 1/9.

Therefore, subsequent steps need to start with the simplified form 2(x-390) and solve for x accordingly. Step 3 now directly equates 2(x-390) with 2x + 780, instead of 2x - 780 = 2x + 780. As a result, the subtraction operation in step 4 is incorrect, but it still reveals that the equation 2x - 780 = 2x + 780 cannot hold true unless the extra bananas (780) is balanced out by an equal amount on the other side of the equation (-780 = 780). Hence, in step 5, instead of equating -780 to 390, it should equate -780 to 780 to maintain this balance. Step 6 then incorrectly solves for x by dividing 780 by 2, which yields the incorrect answer of x = 390.
