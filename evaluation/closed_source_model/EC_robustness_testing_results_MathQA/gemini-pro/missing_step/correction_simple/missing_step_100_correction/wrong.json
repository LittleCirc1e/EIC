However, the number 0.007 was incorrectly subtracted by the value 0.005 - instead of subtracting the expression (0.005*(1-y)), leading to the incorrect solution. Steps 5, 6, and 7, as subsequent related steps, are affected by this wrong calculation. Step 5 will change 0.008y - 0.005y = 0.007 - 0.005 to 0.008y = 0.007 - 0.005, step 6 will change 0.003y = 0.002 to 0.008y = 0.002, and step 7 will change y = 0.002 / 0.003 to y = 0.002 / 0.008. It is step 3 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 4 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing incorrect numbers in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 3.",

        "original_solution": "The diesel required per km is 60 / 600 = 0.1 litres/km\nThe diesel required for 800 km is 0.1 x 800 = 80 litres\nThe diesel requirement is directly proportional to the engine capacity, so the diesel required for 1200 cc engine is 80 x 1200 / 800 = 120 litres\n#### 120",
