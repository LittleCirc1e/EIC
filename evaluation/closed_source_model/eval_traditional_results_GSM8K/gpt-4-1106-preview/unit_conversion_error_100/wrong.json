        "question": "Wendy works at a chocolate factory packing chocolates. She can package 2 dozen chocolates in 5 minutes. How many individual chocolates can she package in 4 hours?",
        "solution": "There are 24 chocolates in a dozen.\nWendy can package 2 x 24 = 48 chocolates in 5 minutes.\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 4 hours is 4 x 60 = 240 minutes.\nWendy can package chocolates in 240 / 5 = 48 sets of 5 minutes.\nWendy can package 48 x 48 = 2304 individual chocolates in 4 hours.\n#### 2304",

        "question": "For every black & white cookie that Elsa makes, she has to make the batter, bake the cookies for 15 minutes and then allow to cool. She then has to dip the cookies in white icing and allow the icing to harden for 30 minutes. Then she has to re-dip them in chocolate icing and allowed to harden for an additional 30 minutes. If it takes her 2 hours to make the cookies from start to finish, how long does it take to make the dough and cool the cookies before she can start dipping them?",
        "solution": "Total time for making cookies is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.\nTime for dipping in white icing and hardening is 30 minutes.\nTime for re-dipping in chocolate icing and hardening is another 30 minutes.\nTotal time for icing processes is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.\nTime to make the dough and cool the cookies is 120 - 60 = 60 minutes.\n#### 60",

        "solution": "Cindy runs for half a mile at 3 miles per hour, which takes 1/3 * 60 = 20 minutes.\nCindy walks for half a mile at 1 mile per hour, which takes 1/1 * 60 = 60 minutes for a full mile, so for half a mile it takes 60/2 = 30 minutes.\nCindy takes 20 + 30 = 50 minutes to travel the full mile.\n#### 50",

        "question": "Angelo and Melanie want to plan how many hours over the next week they should study together for their test next week. They have 2 chapters of their textbook to study and 4 worksheets to memorize. They figure out that they should dedicate 3 hours to each chapter of their textbook and 1.5 hours for each worksheet. If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?",
        "solution": "They need 2 chapters * 3 hours/chapter = 6 hours for the chapters.\nThey need 4 worksheets * 1.5 hours/worksheet = 6 hours for the worksheets.\nTotal study time needed is 6 hours for chapters + 6 hours for worksheets = 12 hours.\nEach hour of study includes a 10-minute break, so each hour is actually 1 hour and 10 minutes.\nTotal time with breaks for 12 hours of study is 12 * (1 hour + 10 minutes) = 12 * 1.1667 hours = 14 hours.\nEach day includes 3 * 10 minutes = 30 minutes of snack breaks and 30 minutes for lunch, adding 1 hour total.\nEach day they can study for 4 hours, but with breaks and lunch, they can only study for 4 hours - 1 hour = 3 hours effectively.\nThey need 14 hours total / 3 hours per day = 4.6667 days.\nSince they can't study for a fraction of a day, they need to round up to the next whole day.\nThey should plan to study for 5 days.\n#### 5",

        "solution": "Abel takes 1000/50 = 20 hours to reach the destination.\nAlice starts an hour later, so she has 1000/40 = 25 hours of driving to do.\nAbel reaches 25 - 20 = 5 hours earlier than Alice.\n5 hours is equivalent to 5 * 60 = 300 minutes.\n#### 300",

His car gets 18 miles per gallon of gas, and his gas indicator comes on when he's used 15 gallons, at which point he stops to refill, which takes 10 minutes. How long, in minutes, does he take to get to his parents' house, if he starts out with a full tank of gas?",
        "solution": "Jeremy drives 600 miles at 50 miles per hour, so the driving time is 600 / 50 = 12 hours.\nEach hour is 60 minutes, so 12 hours is 12 * 60 = 720 minutes of driving.\nHe makes a rest stop every 2 hours, so he stops 12 / 2 = 6 times.\nEach rest stop is 15 minutes, so the total rest time is 6 * 15 = 90 minutes.\nHis car gets 18 miles per gallon, and the gas indicator comes on after 15 gallons, so he can drive 18 * 15 = 270 miles per tank.\nHe will need to stop to refill gas 600 / 270 = 2.22 times, which we round up to 3 times because he can't stop a fraction of a time.\nHe actually only needs to stop to refill 2 times because the third time would be after he arrives.\nEach gas refill takes 10 minutes, so the total refill time is 2 * 10 = 20 minutes.\nThe total time is driving time + rest time + refill time = 720 + 90 + 20 = 830 minutes.\n#### 830",
