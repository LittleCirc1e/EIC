        "question": "Jeanette is practicing her juggling. Each week she can juggle 2 more objects than the week before. If she starts out juggling 3 objects and practices for 5 weeks, how many objects can she juggle?",
        "solution": "In the first week, Jeanette can juggle 3 objects.\nEach subsequent week she juggles 2 more objects than the previous week.\nAfter 5 weeks, the number of objects she can juggle is 3 + 2*(5-1).\nThis is because she adds 2 objects each week for 4 more weeks after the first week.\nSo, 3 + 2*4 = 3 + 8 = 11 objects.\n#### 11",
        "answer": 11,
        "correct": 13.0

        "question": "An organization trying to save endangered species of turtles has taken twice more hawksbill turtles than the number of green turtles into a conservation center. If the number of green turtles is 800, calculate the number of turtles that have been taken into the conservation center.",
        "solution": "The number of hawksbill turtles taken is twice more than the number of green turtles, which means 2 * 800 = 1600 hawksbill turtles.\nThe total number of turtles taken into the conservation center is 800 + 1600 = 2400.\n#### 2400",
        "answer": 2400,
