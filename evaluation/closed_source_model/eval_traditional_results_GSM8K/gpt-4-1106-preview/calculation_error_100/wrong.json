He adds 1 rep a day and once he gets to 15 reps he will start training high elevation push-ups. and then low elevation push-ups, and finally floor push-ups. How many weeks will it take him to get to floor push-ups?",
        "solution": "John starts with wall push-ups and adds 1 rep each day for 5 days a week.\nIt takes him 15/1 = 15 days to reach 15 reps for wall push-ups.\nSince he trains 5 days a week, it will take him 15/5 = 3 weeks to reach high elevation push-ups.\nHe will then train high elevation push-ups for another 3 weeks, low elevation push-ups for another 3 weeks, and finally floor push-ups for another 3 weeks.\nSo in total, it will take him 3+3+3+3 = 12 weeks to get to floor push-ups.\n#### 12",
