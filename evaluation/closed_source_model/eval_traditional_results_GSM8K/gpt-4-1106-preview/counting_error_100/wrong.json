Last Friday her mother asked her to pass by her friend, which is another 2km away from the school in the opposite distance from home. How many kilometers did Christina cover that week?",
        "solution": "Christina walks to school and back home every day, which is 7 km each way, so 7 km * 2 = 14 km per day.\nFrom Monday to Thursday, she covers 14 km/day * 4 days = 56 km.\nOn Friday, she walks to school and back, plus an extra 2 km to her friend’s house, so 14 km + 2 km = 16 km.\nTotal distance covered from Monday to Friday is 56 km + 16 km = 72 km.\n#### 72",

She uses a thick sliced bread that comes 12 slices per loaf. Over 52 weeks, how many loaves of bread will she need to make french toast?",
        "solution": "Each weekend, Suzanne uses 1 slice for herself + 1 slice for her husband + 0.5 slice for her daughters = 2.5 slices.\nEach weekend, she makes french toast twice, so she uses 2.5 slices x 2 = 5 slices.\nOver 52 weeks, she will need 52 weeks x 5 slices per week = 260 slices.\nSince each loaf has 12 slices, she will need 260 slices / 12 slices per loaf = 21.6667 loaves.\nSince she can’t buy a fraction of a loaf, she will need to buy 22 loaves.\n#### 22",
