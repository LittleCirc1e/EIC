        "question": "Maiya has two sisters. The first sister is twice as old as Maiya. The first sister is 1 year younger than Maiya. Their average age is 5. How old is Maiya?",
        "solution": "Let x represent Maiya's age.\nThe first sister is twice as old as Maiya, so the first sister is 2x years old.\nHowever, it is also stated that the first sister is 1 year younger than Maiya, which contradicts the previous statement. This is likely a mistake in the question.\nAssuming the average age of the three sisters is 5, the sum of their ages is 3 * 5 = 15.\nIf we correct the mistake and assume the first sister is 1 year younger than Maiya, then the first sister is x - 1 years old.\nThe second sister's age is not given, but we can call it y.\nSo we have the equation x + (x - 1) + y = 15.\nWithout additional information about the second sister's age, we cannot solve for Maiya's age.\n#### None",

        "question": "Juan needs 10 half-gallons of milk to bake 40 cookies with. How many half-gallons of milk does Juan need to bake 200 dozen cookies?",
        "solution": "First, calculate the number of cookies in 200 dozen. 1 dozen is 12 cookies, so 200 dozen is 200 x 12 = 2400 cookies.\nSince 10 half-gallons of milk are needed for 40 cookies, find out how many half-gallons are needed per cookie by dividing 10 by 40, which gives 10 / 40 = 0.25 half-gallons per cookie.\nNow, multiply the number of cookies (2400) by the amount of milk needed per cookie (0.25) to find the total amount of milk needed: 2400 x 0.25 = 600 half-gallons of milk.\n#### 600",
