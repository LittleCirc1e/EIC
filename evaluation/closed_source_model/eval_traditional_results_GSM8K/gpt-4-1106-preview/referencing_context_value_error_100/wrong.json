        "question": "Carolyn buys a silverware set with 6 knives, 12 forks, and three times as many spoons as knives. Then her friend trades her 10 knives for 6 spoons. What percentage of Carolyn's silverware is knives?",
        "solution": "Originally, Carolyn has 6 knives.\nShe has 3 times as many spoons as knives, so she has 3 * 6 = 18 spoons.\nIn total, Carolyn starts with 6 knives + 12 forks + 18 spoons = 36 pieces of silverware.\nAfter trading, Carolyn has 6 - 10 = -4 knives (which is not possible, so this should be 10 - 6 = 4 knives).\nShe trades 6 spoons for knives, so she has 18 - 6 = 12 spoons left.\nNow, Carolyn has 4 knives + 12 forks + 12 spoons = 28 pieces of silverware.\nThe percentage of knives is (4 knives / 28 pieces) * 100 = 14.2857%.\n#### 14.2857",

        "question": "Jake's neighbors hire him to mow their lawn and plant some flowers. Mowing the lawn takes 1 hour and pays $15. If Jake wants to make $20/hour working for the neighbors, and planting the flowers takes 2 hours, how much should Jake charge (in total, not per hour) for planting the flowers?",
        "solution": "Jake wants to make $20/hour.\nFor 2 hours of planting flowers, he would want to make 2 * $20 = $40.\nSince mowing the lawn pays $15 for 1 hour, and he wants to make $20 for that hour, he needs to charge $40 - $15 = $25 more for planting the flowers to meet his hourly goal.\nTherefore, Jake should charge $40 + $25 = $65 in total for planting the flowers.\n#### 65",

        "question": "A bowl of fruit holds 18 peaches. Four of the peaches are ripe and two more ripen every day, but on the third day three are eaten. How many more ripe peaches than unripe peaches are in the bowl after five days?",
        "solution": "Initially, there are 4 ripe peaches.\nAfter 1 day, 2 more peaches ripen, so there are 4 + 2 = 6 ripe peaches.\nAfter 2 days, 2 more peaches ripen, so there are 6 + 2 = 8 ripe peaches.\nOn the third day, 2 more peaches ripen and 3 are eaten, so there are 8 + 2 - 3 = 7 ripe peaches.\nAfter 4 days, 2 more peaches ripen, so there are 7 + 2 = 9 ripe peaches.\nAfter 5 days, 2 more peaches ripen, so there are 9 + 2 = 11 ripe peaches.\nThere were 18 peaches initially, so there are 18 - 11 = 7 unripe peaches.\nThere are 11 - 7 = 4 more ripe peaches than unripe peaches.\n#### 4",

If all but 4 of the guests eat the brownies ala mode (with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream), how many tubs of ice cream did the guests eat?",
        "solution": "Troy bakes a total of 2 * 16 = 32 pieces of brownies.\nThe guests eat all of 1 pan, which is 16 pieces, and 75% of the second pan, which is 0.75 * 16 = 12 pieces.\nSo, the total number of brownie pieces eaten is 16 + 12 = 28 pieces.\nSince each guest eats 2 scoops of ice cream with their brownie, and there are 28 guests eating brownies ala mode, they eat a total of 28 * 2 = 56 scoops of ice cream.\nOne tub of ice cream provides 8 scoops, so the number of tubs eaten is 56 / 8 = 7 tubs.\n#### 7",

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months.",
        "solution": "Each employee earns $15/hour for a 40-hour workweek, so each employee earns 15 * 40 = $600 per week.\nIn May, with 40 employees, the company pays 40 * $600 = $24000.\nIn June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees remain.\nThe company pays 30 * $600 = $18000 in June.\nThe total amount paid over the two months is $24000 + $18000 = $42000.\n#### 42000",
