        "question": "A school needs to paint the classroom, which is 9 meters long, 8 meters wide, and 3 meters high. The classroom has 4 windows, 2 blackboards, and 2 doors. The windows are 1m by 1.5m, the blackboards are 6m by 1m, and the doors are 2m by 1m. It is known that the paint fee is $4.80 per square meter. How much does it cost to paint a classroom?",
        "solution": "The total area of the walls is 2*(9*3 + 8*3) = 2*(27 + 24) = 2*51 = 102 square meters.\nThe area of the windows is 4*(1*1.5) = 4*1.5 = 6 square meters.\nThe area of the blackboards is 2*(6*1) = 2*6 = 12 square meters.\nThe area of the doors is 2*(2*1) = 2*2 = 4 square meters.\nThe total area that does not need painting is 6 + 12 + 4 = 22 square meters.\nThe total area that needs painting is 102 - 22 = 80 square meters.\nThe cost to paint the classroom is 80 * 4.80 = $384.\n#### 384",

        "question": "The size of a bathroom is 96 sq ft. If the width of the bathroom is 8 feet and the owner wants to extend it by 2 feet on each side, what is the new area of the bathroom?",
        "solution": "The original length of the bathroom is 96 sq ft / 8 ft = 12 ft.\nThe owner wants to extend the width by 2 feet on each side, so the new width is 8 ft + 2 ft + 2 ft = 12 ft.\nThe new area of the bathroom is 12 ft * 12 ft = 144 sq ft.\n#### 144",

        "solution": "First, calculate the total surface area of the walls: 2*(9*3) + 2*(8*3) = 54 + 48 = 102 square meters.\nThen, calculate the total area of the windows: 4*(1*1.5) = 6 square meters.\nNext, calculate the total area of the blackboards: 2*(6*1) = 12 square meters.\nThen, calculate the total area of the doors: 2*(2*1) = 4 square meters.\nNow, subtract the area of the windows, blackboards, and doors from the total wall area: 102 - 6 - 12 - 4 = 80 square meters.\nFinally, calculate the cost to paint the classroom: 80 * 4.80 = $384.\n#### 384",
