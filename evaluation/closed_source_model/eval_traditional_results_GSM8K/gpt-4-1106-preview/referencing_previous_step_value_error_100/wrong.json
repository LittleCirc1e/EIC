        "question": "Adamâ€™s wardrobe is too crowded so he decides to donate some of his clothes to a charity shop. He takes out 4 pairs of pants, 4 jumpers, 4 pajama sets (top and bottom), and 20 t-shirts, then asks his friends if they have anything they want to donate. 3 of his friends donate the same amount of clothing as Adam each. Then he takes another look over his clothing and decides that he actually wants to keep half of his clothes. How many articles of clothing are being donated in total?",
        "solution": "Adam initially takes out 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 32 articles of clothing.\n3 friends donate the same amount, so 3 * 32 = 96 articles of clothing are added.\nIn total, before Adam decides to keep half, there are 32 + 96 = 128 articles of clothing.\nAdam keeps half of his clothes, so he donates half of 32: 32 / 2 = 16.\nHis friends' donations remain the same, so the total donation is 16 + 96 = 112 articles of clothing.\n#### 112",

        "question": "Bill picked 50 apples from the orchard with his wife and two children. He sends each of his kids to school with 3 apples for their two favorite teachers. His wife Jill bakes two apple pies, using 10 apples per pie. How many apples does Bill have left?",
        "solution": "Each child gives away 3 apples to each of their two favorite teachers, so in total, the children give away 3 apples/teacher * 2 teachers/child * 2 children = 12 apples.\nJill uses 10 apples/pie * 2 pies = 20 apples for baking.\nIn total, they have used 12 + 20 = 32 apples.\nBill started with 50 apples, so he has 50 - 32 = 18 apples left.\n#### 18",

        "question": "Prudence was starting a cupcake business. She figured that each cupcake cost $0.75 to make. The first 2 dozen that she made burnt and she had to throw them out. The next 2 came out perfectly and she ended up eating 5 cupcakes right away. Later that day she made 2 more dozen cupcakes and decided to eat 4 more. If she sells the remaining cupcakes at $2.00 each, how much is her net profit?",
        "solution": "First 2 dozen burnt means 2 * 12 = 24 cupcakes were thrown out.\nThe next 2 dozen means another 2 * 12 = 24 cupcakes were made.\nShe ate 5 of these, so 24 - 5 = 19 cupcakes remained.\nLater, she made another 2 dozen, so 2 * 12 = 24 cupcakes were added.\nShe ate 4 of these, so 24 - 4 = 20 cupcakes remained from the second batch.\nIn total, she has 19 + 20 = 39 cupcakes to sell.\nThe cost to make each cupcake is $0.75, so the total cost is 39 * $0.75 = $29.25.\nShe sells each cupcake for $2.00, so her total revenue is 39 * $2.00 = $78.00.\nHer net profit is revenue - cost, which is $78.00 - $29.25 = $48.75.\n#### 48.75",
