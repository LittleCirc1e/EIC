        "question": "John used to be able to squat 135 pounds. After training, he increased that by 265 pounds. He then gets a magical strength-increasing bracer that increases his strength by an additional 600%. How much can he now lift?",
        "solution": "John could squat 135 + 265 = 400 pounds after training.\nThe bracer increases his strength by 600%, so it multiplies his squat by 6 (since 600% is the same as 6 times).\nJohn can now lift 400 * 6 = 2400 pounds.\n#### 2400",

        "question": "Daisy is a poodle puppy who loves to play with her dog toys. She often loses them in various ways, and her owner needs to replace them. On Monday, Daisy played with 5 dog toys. On Tuesday, Daisy had 3 dog toys left after losing some, and her owner went to the store and got her 3 more. On Wednesday, all of Daisy's old and new dog toys were missing, so her owner went to the store and bought her 5 more. If Daisy's owner found all the lost dog toys, including the new dog toys, how many dog toys would Daisy have now?",
        "solution": "Daisy started with 5 dog toys on Monday.\nOn Tuesday, she had 3 left and got 3 more, making it 3+3 = 6 dog toys.\nOn Wednesday, her owner bought her 5 more dog toys.\nIf all lost toys were found, the total would be the original 5, plus the 6 from Tuesday, plus the 5 new ones from Wednesday.\nSo, 5+6+5 = 16 dog toys in total.\n#### 16",

        "question": "Joseph had socks of many different colors. His dresser drawer was filled to overflowing with red, blue, black, and white socks. Uncertain of how many pairs he had of each color, he began to sort his socks. He discovered that he had three more pairs of blue socks than he had pairs of black socks. He had one less pair of red socks than he had pairs of white socks. He had twice as many blue socks as he had of red socks. And he counted a total of 6 red socks. What is the total number of Joseph's socks?",
        "solution": "Joseph had 6 red socks, which means he had 6/2 = 3 pairs of red socks.\nHe had twice as many blue socks as red socks, so he had 3 * 2 = 6 pairs of blue socks.\nHe had three more pairs of blue socks than black socks, so he had 6 - 3 = 3 pairs of black socks.\nHe had one less pair of red socks than white socks, so he had 3 + 1 = 4 pairs of white socks.\nIn total, Joseph had 3 (red) + 6 (blue) + 3 (black) + 4 (white) = 16 pairs of socks.\nSince each pair consists of 2 socks, Joseph had 16 * 2 = 32 socks in total.\n#### 32",

        "solution": "John reads 60% faster, so he takes 100% - 60% = 40% of the time his brother takes.\n40% of 8 hours is 0.40 * 8 = 3.2 hours per book for John.\nTo read 3 books, John takes 3 * 3.2 = 9.6 hours.\n#### 9.6",

        "solution": "Ashley invited 20 friends and each invited one more person, so 20 friends + 20 additional people = 40 people invited.\nHalf of the invited guests brought one more person, so half of 40 is 20, which means 20 extra people came.\nTotal number of people at the party is Ashley + invited guests + extra people, which is 1 + 40 + 20 = 61.\n#### 61",

        "question": "Chris wants to hold his breath underwater for 90 straight seconds so he starts training each day. On the first day, he holds it for 10 seconds. On the second day, he holds it for 20 seconds. On the third day, he holds it for 30 seconds. After realizing that he can hold it for ten extra seconds each day, he realizes he can calculate how many days it is until he reaches 90 if he keeps up the same pace. So how many days until he can hold his breath for 90 seconds?",
        "solution": "The sequence of seconds he can hold his breath is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1 = 10 and the common difference d = 10.\nTo find the number of terms n when the nth term an = 90, use the formula an = a1 + (n - 1)d.\nSubstitute the known values to get 90 = 10 + (n - 1)10.\nSolve for n: 90 = 10 + 10n - 10.\nCombine like terms: 90 = 10n.\nDivide by 10: n = 90 / 10.\nn = 9.\nChris can hold his breath for 90 seconds on the 9th day.\n#### 9",

        "question": "Bill is ordering a new truck. He has decided to purchase a two-ton truck with several added features: a king cab upgrade, a towing package, leather seats, running boards, and the upgraded exterior light package. The base price of the truck is $30,000, and the other features are at extra cost. The king cab is an extra $7,500, leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1500. What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?",
        "solution": "The cost of the leather seats is 1/3 of the cost of the king cab upgrade, so leather seats cost 7500/3 = $2500.\nThe cost of the running boards is $500 less than the leather seats, so running boards cost 2500-500 = $2000.\nThe total cost of the added features is 7500 (king cab) + 2500 (leather seats) + 2000 (running boards) + 1500 (light package) = $15500.\nThe total cost of the truck is the base price plus the cost of added features, so the total cost is 30000 (base price) + 15500 (added features) = $45500.\n#### 45500",
