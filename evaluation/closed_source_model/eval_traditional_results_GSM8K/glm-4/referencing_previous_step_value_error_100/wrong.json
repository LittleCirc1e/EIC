        "question": "A baker bakes 5 loaves of bread an hour in one oven. He has 4 ovens. From Monday to Friday, he bakes for 5 hours, but on Saturday and Sunday, he only bakes for 2 hours. How many loaves of bread does the baker bake in 3 weeks?",
        "solution": "In one day, with 4 ovens, the baker bakes 5 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 25 loaves in a regular day.\nOn weekends, he bakes 5 loaves/hour * 2 hours = 10 loaves in a weekend day.\nFrom Monday to Friday, he bakes 25 loaves/day * 5 days = 125 loaves in a week.\nOn Saturday and Sunday, he bakes 10 loaves/day * 2 days = 20 loaves in a weekend.\nSo, in one week, he bakes 125 loaves + 20 loaves = 145 loaves.\nIn 3 weeks, he bakes 145 loaves/week * 3 weeks = 435 loaves.\n#### 435",

        "question": "After tracking his workout routine for 8 weeks, Josh discovered that he had spent 4 hours working out every week except on some occasions. At one point, he spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks. Another time, he spent 6 hours in one week. What is the total number of hours he has spent working out across the 8 weeks?",
        "solution": "For 6 of the 8 weeks, Josh worked out for 4 hours each week.\nSo, for these 6 weeks, he spent 6 x 4 = 24 hours working out.\nFor 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.\nSo, for these 2 weeks, he spent 2 x 5 = 10 hours working out.\nIn one week, he worked out for 6 hours.\nAdding all these up, he spent 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours working out across the 8 weeks.\n#### 40",

Normally she can download 2 GB/minute, but 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. How long does it take to download the file?",
        "solution": "Carla downloads 40% of 200 GB, which is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB\nAt a rate of 2 GB/minute, Carla would have taken 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes to download the first 40%\nAfter the restart, she has to download the full 200 GB again\nThe total download time is the time to download 200 GB at 2 GB/minute, plus the 20 minutes for the restart\nThis is (200 GB / 2 GB/minute) + 20 minutes = 100 minutes + 20 minutes\n#### 120",

On the weekends, she usually made $10.00 an hour babysitting and was guaranteed 4 hours every Saturday from her neighbor. How much money did she make over 7 days?",
        "solution": "Morning dog walking earnings per day: 2 hours x $10.00/hour = $20.00\nAfter school card shop earnings per day: 2 hours x $12.50/hour = $25.00\nWeekday total earnings: 5 days x ($20.00 + $25.00) = $225.00\nSaturday babysitting earnings: 4 hours x $10.00/hour = $40.00\nTotal earnings over 7 days: Weekday total + Saturday babysitting = $225.00 + $40.00\n#### $265.00",

        "question": "Two white socks cost 25 cents more than a single brown sock. If two white socks cost 45 cents, how much would you pay for 15 brown socks?",
        "solution": "Let the cost of a brown sock be x cents.\nTwo white socks cost 45 cents, which is x + 25 cents for two.\nSo, the cost of one white sock is (45 - 25) / 2 = 20 cents.\nSince two white socks cost 25 cents more than a brown sock, then x + 25 = 45.\nThis means the cost of a brown sock, x = 45 - 25 = 20 cents.\nTo find the cost of 15 brown socks, we multiply the cost of one brown sock by 15.\n15 brown socks would cost 15 * 20 = 300 cents.\n#### 300",

        "question": "Prudence was starting a cupcake business. She figured that each cupcake cost $0.75 to make. The first 2 dozen that she made burnt and she had to throw them out. The next 2 came out perfectly and she ended up eating 5 cupcakes right away. Later that day she made 2 more dozen cupcakes and decided to eat 4 more. If she sells the remaining cupcakes at $2.00 each, how much is her net profit?",
        "solution": "She made a total of 2 dozen + 2 dozen + 2 dozen = 6 dozen cupcakes.\n1 dozen is equal to 12 cupcakes, so she made 6 x 12 = 72 cupcakes in total.\nShe threw out 2 dozen cupcakes, which is 2 x 12 = 24 cupcakes.\nAfter throwing out the burnt cupcakes, she had 72 - 24 = 48 cupcakes left.\nShe ate 5 cupcakes right away, so she had 48 - 5 = 43 cupcakes left.\nThen she made 2 more dozen, which is another 2 x 12 = 24 cupcakes.\nAfter making the additional cupcakes, she had 43 + 24 = 67 cupcakes.\nShe ate 4 more cupcakes, so she had 67 - 4 = 63 cupcakes left to sell.\nShe sells each cupcake for $2.00, so her total revenue from selling cupcakes is 63 x 2 = $126.00\nThe cost to make each cupcake is $0.75, so the total cost to make 63 cupcakes is 63 x 0.75 = $47.25\nHer net profit is the revenue minus the cost, which is $126.00 - $47.25 = $78.75\n#### $78.75",
