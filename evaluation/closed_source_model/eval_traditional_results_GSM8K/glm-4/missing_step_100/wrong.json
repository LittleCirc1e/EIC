        "question": "Daisy is a poodle puppy who loves to play with her dog toys. She often loses them in various ways, and her owner needs to replace them. On Monday, Daisy played with 5 dog toys. On Tuesday, Daisy had 3 dog toys left after losing some, and her owner went to the store and got her 3 more. On Wednesday, all of Daisy's old and new dog toys were missing, so her owner went to the store and bought her 5 more. If Daisy's owner found all the lost dog toys, including the new dog toys, how many dog toys would Daisy have now?",
        "solution": "On Monday, Daisy had 5 dog toys.\nOn Tuesday, after losing some, she had 3 dog toys left, and her owner bought her 3 more, so she had 3 + 3 = 6 dog toys.\nOn Wednesday, she lost all her dog toys, and her owner bought her 5 more, so she would have 5 dog toys.\nIf Daisy found all her lost dog toys, including the new ones, she would have 5 (from Wednesday) + 6 (from Tuesday) = 11 dog toys.\n#### 11",

        "question": "Joseph had socks of many different colors. His dresser drawer was filled to overflowing with red, blue, black, and white socks. Uncertain of how many pairs he had of each color, he began to sort his socks. He discovered that he had three more pairs of blue socks than he had pairs of black socks. He had one less pair of red socks than he had pairs of white socks. He had twice as many blue socks as he had of red socks. And he counted a total of 6 red socks. What is the total number of Joseph's socks?",
        "solution": "If he counted 6 red socks, then he has 6/2 = 3 pairs of red socks.\nSince he had one less pair of red socks than he had pairs of white socks, then he has 3+1 = 4 pairs of white socks.\nHe had twice as many blue socks as he had of red socks, meaning he had 2*3 = 6 pairs of blue socks.\nSince he had three more pairs of blue socks than he had pairs of black socks, then he had 6-3 = 3 pairs of black socks.\nNow, to find the total number of socks, we add up the number of socks for each color: (3 pairs of red * 2 socks per pair) + (4 pairs of white * 2 socks per pair) + (6 pairs of blue * 2 socks per pair) + (3 pairs of black * 2 socks per pair)\nThis is equal to 6 + 8 + 12 + 6 = 32 socks in total.\n#### 32",

        "question": "John can read a book 60% faster than his brother. If his brother takes 8 hours to read a book, how long would it take John to read 3 books?",
        "solution": "John reads 60% faster than his brother, which means he takes 100% - 60% = 40% of the time his brother takes.\nSo, John takes 40/100 * 8 hours = 3.2 hours to read a book.\nTo read 3 books, it would take John 3.2 hours/book * 3 books = 9.6 hours.\n#### 9.6",

        "solution": "Ashley invited 20 friends, so there would be 20+1 = 21 people if each friend came alone.\nHalf of the invited guests, which is 20/2 = 10, brought one more person each.\nSo, 10 additional people came, making the total number of guests 21 + 10 = 31.\nSince we need to include Ashley, the total number of people at the party is 31 + 1 = 32.\n#### 32",

        "solution": "Mike plays video games for 4/2 = 2 hours a day.\nHe plays video games for 2 x 3 = 6 hours in a week.\nHe watches TV for 4 x (7 - 3) = 4 x 4 = 16 hours in a week, excluding the days he plays video games.\nSo, he spends a total of 16 + 6 = 22 hours watching TV and playing video games in a week.\n#### 22",

        "question": "Chris wants to hold his breath underwater for 90 straight seconds so he starts training each day. On the first day, he holds it for 10 seconds. On the second day, he holds it for 20 seconds. On the third day, he holds it for 30 seconds. After realizing that he can hold it for ten extra seconds each day, he realizes he can calculate how many days it is until he reaches 90 if he keeps up the same pace. So how many days until he can hold his breath for 90 seconds?",
        "solution": "On the first day, Chris holds his breath for 10 seconds.\nOn the second day, he holds it for 10 + 10 = 20 seconds.\nOn the third day, he holds it for 20 + 10 = 30 seconds.\nThis is an arithmetic sequence where each day he adds 10 seconds.\nLet's call the number of days he has been training \"n\".\nThe nth term of this sequence is given by: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference.\nWe want to solve the equation a_n = 90, so 10 + (n - 1) * 10 = 90.\nThis simplifies to 10n = 90.\nDividing both sides by 10, we get n = 9.\n#### 9",
