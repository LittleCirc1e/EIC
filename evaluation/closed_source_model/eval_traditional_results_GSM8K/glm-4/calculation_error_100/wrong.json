        "solution": "Each uncle and aunt has 2 children, so there are 3 uncles x 2 children = 6 cousins from uncles.\nThere are 4 aunts x 2 children = 8 cousins from aunts.\nIn total, there are 6 + 8 = 14 cousins.\nAdding Iris’ brother and mother, the total number of people is 14 + 1 + 1 = 16.\n#### 16",

        "question": "John is very unfit and decides to work up to doing a push-up. He trains 5 days a week for them and starts with wall push-ups. He adds 1 rep a day and once he gets to 15 reps he will start training high elevation push-ups. and then low elevation push-ups, and finally floor push-ups. How many weeks will it take him to get to floor push-ups?",
        "solution": "John starts at 0 reps and adds 1 rep each day he trains.\nHe needs to reach 15 reps for each type of push-up (wall, high elevation, low elevation, and floor).\nSince he trains 5 days a week, he will reach 15 reps in 15 days for each type of push-up.\nHe needs to go through this process 4 times (for each type of push-up).\nSo, the total number of days it will take is 15 days per type * 4 types = 60 days.\nSince he trains 5 days a week, the total number of weeks is 60 days / 5 days/week = 12 weeks.\n#### 12",

        "solution": "The number of leopards is 200/2 = 100 because the number of lions is twice the number of leopards.\nThe combined number of lions and leopards is 200 + 100 = 300.\nThe number of elephants is 300/2 = 150 because it is half the combined number of lions and leopards.\n#### 550",
