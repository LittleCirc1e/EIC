        "question": "John decided to start rowing around a square lake. Each side of the lake is 15 miles. Jake can row at twice the speed he can swim. It takes him 20 minutes to swim 1 mile. How long, in hours, does it take to row the lake?",
        "solution": "The perimeter of the square lake is 4 x 15 = 60 miles.\nJake swims at a speed of 1 mile per 20 minutes.\nSo, he swims at a speed of 60 miles / 20 minutes = 3 miles per minute.\nSince he rows at twice the speed he swims, he rows at a speed of 3 miles/minute x 2 = 6 miles per minute.\nTo row 60 miles at a speed of 6 miles per minute, it will take him 60 miles / 6 miles per minute = 10 minutes.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take him 10 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 1/6 hour.\n#### 1/6",

        "question": "Jake's neighbors hire him to mow their lawn and plant some flowers. Mowing the lawn takes 1 hour and pays $15. If Jake wants to make $20/hour working for the neighbors, and planting the flowers takes 2 hours, how much should Jake charge (in total, not per hour) for planting the flowers?",
        "solution": "Jake earns $15 for mowing the lawn in 1 hour.\nFor planting flowers, he wants to make $20/hour.\nHe will work for 2 hours planting flowers, so he should charge 20 * 2 = $40 for planting flowers.\n#### 40",

        "question": "A bowl of fruit holds 18 peaches. Four of the peaches are ripe and two more ripen every day, but on the third day three are eaten. How many more ripe peaches than unripe peaches are in the bowl after five days?",
        "solution": "On the first day, there are 4 ripe peaches and 18 - 4 = 14 unripe peaches.\nOn the second day, 4 + 2 = 6 peaches ripen, so there are 6 ripe peaches and 14 - 2 = 12 unripe peaches.\nOn the third day, 3 peaches are eaten, so there are 6 - 3 = 3 ripe peaches left, and still 12 unripe peaches.\nOn the fourth day, 3 + 2 = 5 ripe peaches, and 12 - 2 = 10 unripe peaches.\nOn the fifth day, 5 + 2 = 7 ripe peaches, and 10 - 2 = 8 unripe peaches.\n#### 7 - 8 = -1",

If she accidentally finds twice as many nickels as she has in her older brother's treasure box, and takes them for herself, what would be the value of money she has, in dollars, if she had 20 nickels before finding the new ones from her brother's treasure box?",
        "solution": "Val had 20 nickels, so she found 2 * 20 = 40 nickels in her brother's treasure box.\nAfter finding the new nickels, she has a total of 20 + 40 = 60 nickels.\nSince Val has three times as many dimes as nickels, she has 3 * 60 = 180 dimes.\nThe value of 60 nickels is 60 * $0.05 = $3.\nThe value of 180 dimes is 180 * $0.10 = $18.\nSo, the total value of money Val has is $3 + $18 = $21.\n#### 21",

Sea World is 165 miles away and her car gets 30 miles per gallon of gas. If gas costs $3 a gallon, how much more will she have to save up?",
        "solution": "The total cost of the trip is the sum of parking, park entry, and the meal pass costs.\nTotal cost = $10 + $55 + $25 = $90\nSally will need to travel 165 miles to Sea World.\nHer car gets 30 miles per gallon, so she will need 165 / 30 = 5.5 gallons of gas.\nAt $3 per gallon, the total cost of gas for the trip is 5.5 * $3 = $16.5\nThe total amount Sally needs to save is the cost of the trip plus the cost of gas.\nTotal needed = $90 + $16.5 = $106.5\nSally already has $28 saved, so she needs to save an additional $106.5 - $28 = $78.5\n#### $78.5",
