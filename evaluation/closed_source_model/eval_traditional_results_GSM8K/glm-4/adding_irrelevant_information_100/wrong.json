        "question": "An organization trying to save endangered species of turtles has taken twice more hawksbill turtles than the number of green turtles into a conservation center. If the number of green turtles is 800, calculate the number of turtles that have been taken into the conservation center.",
        "solution": "The number of hawksbill turtles is twice the number of green turtles, which is 800 * 2 = 1600.\nThe total number of turtles in the conservation center is the sum of the hawksbill and green turtles, which is 1600 + 800 = 2400.\n#### 2400",
        "answer": 2400,
        "correct": 3200.0

        "question": "Elmer has a pond that initially contained 2400 pollywogs, but these pollywogs matured into toads and left the pond at a constant rate of 50 pollywogs per day. In addition, Elmer has a son named Melvin, who loves to catch pollywogs, remove them from the pond, and release them into a nearby stream. For the first 20 days, Melvin caught 10 pollywogs per day and released them into the stream. How many days did it take for all of the pollywogs to disappear from the pond?",
        "solution": "Melvin removed 10 pollywogs per day for 20 days, so he removed 10 * 20 = 200 pollywogs.\nEach day, 50 pollywogs matured into toads and left the pond, so in 20 days, 50 * 20 = 1000 pollywogs left due to maturation.\nThe total decrease in pollywogs each day is 50 (maturation) + 10 (Melvin) = 60 pollywogs per day.\nInitially, there were 2400 pollywogs, and 200 were removed by Melvin, and 1000 left due to maturation, so 2400 - 200 - 1000 = 1200 pollywogs remained after 20 days.\nIt took 1200 / 60 = 20 additional days for the remaining pollywogs to disappear from the pond.\n#### 40",
