        "question": "Boston had .5 feet of snow on the first day of winter. The next day they got an additional 8 inches. Over the next 2 days, 2 inches of the snow melted. On the fifth day, they received another 2 times the amount of snow they received on the first day. How many feet of snow do they now have?",
        "solution": "8 inches is equal to 8/12 = 2/3 feet of snow.\nAfter the second day, they had .5 + 2/3 = 5/6 feet of snow.\n2 inches melted is equal to 2/12 = 1/6 feet of snow.\nAfter 2 days of melting, they had 5/6 - 1/6 = 2/3 feet of snow.\nOn the fifth day, they received 2 x .5 = 1 foot of snow.\nNow, they have 2/3 + 1 = 5/3 feet of snow.\n#### 5/3",

        "solution": "First, find the number of breaths in one hour:\n17 breaths/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 1020 breaths/hour\nThen, find the number of breaths in 24 hours:\n1020 breaths/hour * 24 hours = 24480 breaths\nNow, calculate the total volume of air inhaled in 24 hours:\n24480 breaths * 5/9 L/breath = 13600/9 L\nSimplify the fraction:\n13600/9 L = 1511.11 L (rounded to two decimal places)\n#### 1511.11",

        "question": "For every black & white cookie that Elsa makes, she has to make the batter, bake the cookies for 15 minutes and then allow to cool. She then has to dip the cookies in white icing and allow the icing to harden for 30 minutes. Then she has to re-dip them in chocolate icing and allowed to harden for an additional 30 minutes. If it takes her 2 hours to make the cookies from start to finish, how long does it take to make the dough and cool the cookies before she can start dipping them?",
        "solution": "Total time to harden icing = 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes\nTotal time to bake and cool cookies = 15 minutes + additional cooling time\nTotal time to make cookies from start to finish = 2 hours = 120 minutes\nTime to make dough and cool cookies = Total time to make cookies - time to harden icing - time to bake and cool cookies\n#### 120 - 60 - 15 = 55 minutes",

They have 2 chapters of their textbook to study and 4 worksheets to memorize. They figure out that they should dedicate 3 hours to each chapter of their textbook and 1.5 hours for each worksheet. If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?",
        "solution": "Time needed for 2 chapters = 2 * 3 = 6 hours\nTime needed for 4 worksheets = 4 * 1.5 = 6 hours\nTotal study time needed = 6 + 6 = 12 hours\nEach day they can study 4 hours but with breaks:\nEach hour they take a 10-minute break, so 4 hours = 4 * 10 = 40 minutes of breaks\nThey also include 3 10-minute snack breaks, so 3 * 10 = 30 minutes\nAnd they include 30 minutes for lunch each day\nTotal break time per day = 40 + 30 + 30 = 100 minutes\nActual study time per day = 4 hours - 100 minutes = 240 minutes - 100 minutes = 140 minutes or 2.333 hours\nTo cover 12 hours of study, they need 12 / 2.333 = 5.197 days\nSince they cannot study a fraction of a day, they need to round up to the nearest whole day.\n#### 6",
