        "question": "Bob is building a garden on his land, and he wants it to be fenced in to keep out varmints. The garden is a rectangular plot 225 feet long by 125 feet wide. He also wants to have a small 3-foot wide gate to walk through and a larger 10-foot wide gate to move his gardening equipment through. How much fencing is Bob going to need to fence in his garden, taking into account the two gates?",
        "solution": "The perimeter of the garden without the gates is\n2 * (225 + 125) = 650 feet.\nBob needs to subtract the width of the two gates from the total fencing needed.\nSo, he needs to subtract 3 feet for the small gate and 10 feet for the large gate.\nTherefore, the fencing needed is 650 - 3 - 10 = 637 feet.\n#### 637",

        "solution": "The thickness of the walls will reduce each dimension by 2 inches since there are two sides to each dimension.\nSo the internal dimensions are 26 - 2 = 24 inches by 24 inches by 14 - 2 = 12 inches.\nTo convert the volume from cubic inches to cubic feet, we divide by 12^3 since there are 12 inches in a foot.\nSo the internal volume is 24 * 24 * 12 / (12 * 12 * 12) = 2 cubic feet.\n#### 2",

        "question": "How many right triangles with a height of 2 inches and a width of two inches could fit inside a square with 2-inch sides?",
        "solution": "The area of the square is 2*2 = 4 square inches.\nA right triangle with a height of 2 inches and width of 2 inches has an area of 2*2/2 = 2 square inches.\nTo find out how many triangles can fit in the square, we divide the area of the square by the area of one triangle: 4 / 2 = 2.\nHowever, this only counts the triangles that are placed flat on the bottom. Since the triangles can also be placed on their sides, we can fit another row of triangles on top.\nThus, we can fit 2 rows of triangles flat and 2 rows on their sides, for a total of 2*2 = 4 rows.\nEach row will have 2 triangles because 2*2 = 2.\nTherefore, we can fit 4*2 = 8 triangles in total.\n#### 8",

        "question": "How many right triangles with a height of 2 inches and a width of two inches could fit inside a square with 2-inch sides?",
        "solution": "The area of the square is determined by the formula: side * side.\nSo, the area of the square is 2 inches * 2 inches = 4 square inches.\nA right triangle with a height of 2 inches and a width of 2 inches has an area of 1/2 * height * width = 1/2 * 2 inches * 2 inches = 2 square inches.\nTo find out how many triangles can fit inside the square, we divide the area of the square by the area of one triangle: 4 square inches / 2 square inches = 2 triangles per side of the square.\nSince we can place triangles on both sides of the square, we multiply by 4 (for the four sides of the square), but we must subtract 4 (for the four corners that would be counted twice).\nSo, the number of triangles is (2 * 4) - 4 = 8 - 4 = 4.\nHowever, this is incorrect because we are only considering the sides of the square, not the area inside it. We should instead calculate the total area of the square and divide it by the area of one triangle.\nSo, the number of triangles is 4 square inches / 2 square inches = 2 per side, which would be 2 * 2 = 4 for the entire area of the square.\n#### 4",
