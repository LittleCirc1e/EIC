        "question": "A local college is offering German lessons and currently has 8 students enrolled. Through advertising, 8 more became interested but a fourth of these dropped out within a day. 2 more got frustrated and left. The class then rallied to show how simple the course actually is and increased enrollment by 5 times the amount of students already enrolled in the class, but 2 had to drop it because of scheduling conflicts. After one last rally, 6 more people enrolled. As the days passed, half of the class eventually dropped, and half of the remaining students graduated. How many are still enrolled?",
        "solution": "Initial enrollment: 8 students\nNewly interested after advertising: 8 students\nDropped out after a day: 8 * 1/4 = 2 students\nLeft due to frustration: 2 students\nAfter the first rally, new enrollment: 5 * (8 - 2) = 5 * 6 = 30 students\nDropped because of scheduling conflicts: 2 students\nEnrollment after the second rally: 8 + 6 + 30 - 2 + 6 = 50 students\nDropped after some days: 50 / 2 = 25 students\nRemaining after half dropped: 50 - 25 = 25 students\nGraduated: 25 / 2 = 12.5, but since we can't have half a student, we consider only the whole number.\nRemaining students: 25 - 12 = 13 students\n#### 13",

        "solution": "Paul travels 5 stories x 10 feet/story = 50 feet each trip up or down.\nSince he makes 3 trips a day, he travels 50 feet x 3 = 150 feet per day.\nIn a week, he travels 150 feet x 7 days = 1050 feet in total.\n#### 1050",

        "question": "Valerie needs to put stamps on the envelopes she is about to mail. She has thank you cards for each of her grandmother, uncle and aunt for the birthday presents they sent. She also has to pay the water bill and the electric bill separately. She wants to send three more mail-in rebates than she does bills and she has twice as many job applications as rebates to mail. How many stamps does she need if everything needs 1 stamp except the electric bill, which needs 2?",
        "solution": "Valerie has to send thank you cards to 3 people.\nShe has to pay 2 bills, but the electric bill needs 2 stamps.\nSo, the number of stamps for bills is 1 (water bill) + 2 (electric bill) = 3 stamps.\nShe has 3 more rebates than bills, so she has 3 + 2 = 5 rebates.\nShe has twice as many job applications as rebates, so she has 5 x 2 = 10 job applications.\nFor everything else, she needs 3 (thank you cards) + 5 (rebates) + 10 (job applications) = 18 stamps.\nAdding the stamps for the electric bill, she needs 18 + 2 = 20 stamps in total.\n#### 20",

        "question": "Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?",
        "solution": "Let the original price of jogger jeans be J and the original price of tattered jeans be T.\nThe tattered jeans cost $28, so T = $28.\nThe jogger jeans cost $6 less, so J = T - $6 = $28 - $6 = $22.\nHe saved a total of $6, and 1/3 of this is from the jogger jeans, so he saved $6 * 1/3 = $2 from the jogger jeans.\nThe rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, is from the tattered jeans.\nSince the jogger jeans were originally $22 and the tattered jeans were originally $28,\nthe jogger jeans originally cost $28 - $22 = $6 less than the tattered jeans.\nBut since he saved $4 from the tattered jeans, the difference must be $6 + $4 = $10.\n#### 10",

        "solution": "There are 6 people in total because 1 (Jenny) + 5 (friends) = 6\nEach person pays $50 for the ticket and $10 for the entrée, so they pay $60 in total.\nHalf the people (3 people) buy drink tickets, so 3 x $30 = $90 additional for drink tickets.\nFor each person, the total cost is $60 + $90 = $150\nThe total cost for the group is 6 x $150 = $900\nThey get a 90% refund, so they lose 100% - 90% = 10% of the money.\nThey lose $900 x 10% = $90 in total.\n#### $90",
