        "question": "Christina walks 7km to school every day from Monday to Friday. She returns home covering the same distance. Last Friday her mother asked her to pass by her friend, which is another 2km away from the school in the opposite direction from home. How many kilometers did Christina cover that week?",
        "solution": "Christina walks 7km to school and 7km back home each day, so she covers 7+7 = 14km per day.\nFrom Monday to Thursday, she covers 14km x 4 days = 56km.\nOn Friday, she covers 14km to and from school, plus an additional 2km to her mother's friend, so 14+14+2 = 30km on Friday.\nIn total, she covers 56km from Monday to Thursday + 30km on Friday = 86km that week.\n#### 86",

        "question": "A baker bakes 5 loaves of bread an hour in one oven. He has 4 ovens. From Monday to Friday, he bakes for 5 hours, but on Saturday and Sunday, he only bakes for 2 hours. How many loaves of bread does the baker bake in 3 weeks?",
        "solution": "In one day, with 4 ovens, the baker bakes 5 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 25 loaves in a regular day.\nOn weekends, he bakes 5 loaves/hour * 2 hours = 10 loaves in a weekend day.\nFrom Monday to Friday, he bakes 25 loaves/day * 5 days = 125 loaves in a week.\nOn Saturday and Sunday, he bakes 10 loaves/day * 2 days = 20 loaves in a weekend.\nSo, in one week, he bakes 125 loaves + 20 loaves = 145 loaves.\nIn 3 weeks, he bakes 145 loaves/week * 3 weeks = 435 loaves.\n#### 435",
