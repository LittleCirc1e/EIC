        "solution": "Soccer practice is 2 hours per day on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday because 5:00 p.m. - 3:00 p.m. = 2 hours\nSo, soccer practice is 2 hours x 3 days = 6 hours in total for the week.\nBand practice is 1.5 hours per day on Tuesday and Thursday because 5:00 p.m. - 3:30 p.m. = 1.5 hours\nSo, band practice is 1.5 hours x 2 days = 3 hours in total for the week.\nJosh spends 6 + 3 = 9 hours on extracurricular activities from Monday to Friday.\n#### 9",

        "solution": "Elle practices 30 minutes per day from Monday to Friday, which is 30 x 5 = 150 minutes.\nOn Saturday, she practices three times as much, which is 30 x 3 = 90 minutes.\nIn total, she practices 150 + 90 = 240 minutes per week.\nTo convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 because there are 60 minutes in an hour, so 240 / 60 = 4 hours.\n#### 4",
