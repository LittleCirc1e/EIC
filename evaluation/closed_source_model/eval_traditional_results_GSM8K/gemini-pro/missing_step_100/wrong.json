        "solution": "Let x be the age of Alex and y be the age of Allison.\nWhen Diane turns 30, she will be half the age of Alex, so 30 = x/2.\nWhen Diane turns 30, she will be twice as old as Allison, so 30 = 2y.\nDiane is 16 years old now, so x - 16 = 30 and y - 16 = 15.\nSolve for x and y, we get x = 46 and y = 31.\nThe sum of the ages of Alex and Allison now is 46 + 31 = 77.\n#### 77",

He had one less pair of red socks than he had pairs of white socks. He had twice as many blue socks as he had of red socks. And he counted a total of 6 red socks. What is the total number of Joseph's socks?",
        "solution": "Let x be the number of pairs of black socks.\nThen the number of pairs of blue socks is x + 3.\nThe number of pairs of red socks is 6 / 2 = 3.\nThe number of pairs of white socks is 3 + 1 = 4.\nThe total number of pairs of socks is x + (x + 3) + 3 + 4 = 2x + 10.\nSince there are 2 socks in each pair, the total number of socks is 2(2x + 10) = 4x + 20.\n#### 4x + 20",
