        "question": "Manex is a tour bus driver. He has to drive 55 miles to the destination and drive going back to the starting point on a different way that is 10 miles farther. If he can drive 1 mile for 2 minutes and stayed 2 hours at the destination, how long will it take the bus driver to do the entire tour in hours?",
        "solution": "He drives 55 + 10 = 65 miles on the way back.\nHe drives a total of 55 + 65 = 120 miles for the entire tour.\nIt will take him 240 minutes to drive the entire tour because 120 x 2 = 240\nHe will take 4 hours to drive the entire tour because 240 / 60 = 4\n#### 4",

The bread takes 30 minutes to bake and 15 minutes to cool. If the bakery opens at 6:00 am, what is the latest time the head baker can make it to the store to start working?",
        "solution": "It takes 1 hour for the dough to come to room temperature.\nIt takes 2 hours and 45 minutes for the dough to be shaped, proofed, and ready to bake because 15 + 2 hours + 30 = 2 hours and 45 minutes.\nThe bread takes 45 minutes to bake and cool because 30 + 15 = 45.\nThe total time needed is 3 hours and 30 minutes because 1 + 2 hours and 45 minutes + 45 = 3 hours and 30 minutes.\nThe head baker needs to arrive at 2:30 am because 6 - 3 hours and 30 minutes = 2:30 am.\n#### 2:30 am",

        "solution": "It takes 240 minutes to roast one turkey because 16 x 15 = 240\nIt takes 480 minutes to roast both turkeys because 2 x 240 = 480\nShe needs to start roasting at 1:00 pm because 6:00 - 5 hours = 1:00\n#### 1:00 pm",

His car gets 18 miles per gallon of gas, and his gas indicator comes on when he's used 15 gallons, at which point he stops to refill, which takes 10 minutes. How long, in minutes, does he take to get to his parents' house, if he starts out with a full tank of gas?",
        "solution": "He drives for 12 hours because 600 / 50 = 12\nHe makes 6 rest stops because 12 / 2 = 6\nThe rest stops take 90 minutes because 6 x 15 = 90\nHe uses 33.33 gallons of gas because 600 / 18 = 33.33\nHe makes 3 gas stops because 33.33 / 15 = 2.22\nThe gas stops take 30 minutes because 3 x 10 = 30\nHe takes 810 minutes in total because 12 x 60 + 90 + 30 = 810\n#### 810",

If Lukeâ€™s entire trip takes him 8 hours, how many minutes does his bus ride take?",
        "solution": "Let x be the time Luke waits for the train.\nLuke's entire trip takes 8 hours, so the bus ride, walk, wait, and train ride take 8 hours in total.\nLuke's bus ride takes x hours because 8 - 6 - 2x - 15/60 = x\nLuke's bus ride takes 2 hours because 8 - 6 - 2(2) - 15/60 = 2\nLuke's bus ride takes 120 minutes because 2 x 60 = 120\n#### 120",
