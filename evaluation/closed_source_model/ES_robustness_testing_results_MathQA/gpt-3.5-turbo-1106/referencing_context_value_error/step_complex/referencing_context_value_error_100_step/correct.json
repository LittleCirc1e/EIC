Its subsequent related step will be affected, resulting in 2d being equal to 26 instead of 28. This leads to the incorrect calculation of d = 13 instead of d = 14 in step 6.

        "original_solution": "Let x be the distance from home that Aaron can jog at 3 miles per hour.\nIt takes x/3 hours for Aaron to jog from home at 3 miles per hour, so it will take x/3 hours to walk back home at 6 miles per hour.\nTotal time is x/3 + x/(6) = 3\nMultiplying through by 6 gives us 2x + x = 18\nCombining like terms gives us 3x = 18\nDividing both sides by 3 gives us x = 6\n#### 6",
