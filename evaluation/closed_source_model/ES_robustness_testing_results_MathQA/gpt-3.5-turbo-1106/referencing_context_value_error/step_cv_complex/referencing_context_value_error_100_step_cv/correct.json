        "explanation": "Step 1 references 20 in the question as 25 wrongly, thus changing the first equation to x + y = 25 instead of the original x + y = 20. This affects the subsequent calculation directly related to this step: the substitution step results in 2(25 - y) = 3y + 5 instead of the correct 2(20 - y) = 3y + 5. The transformed_answer becomes 16 and 9, different from the original_answer, but the operations performed after the erroneous step are done correctly. Each step that requires the sum of the numbers still references the number 20 correctly, except for the step referenced incorrectly.",

        "step_explanation": "Step 1 first makes an error in referencing the number of the question description <Sum of two numbers is 20.>. It erroneously references 20 as 25, causing the formula to calculate 25 - y = 25 - y instead of 20 - y = 25 - y. This affects subsequent steps 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 that reference its result. Step 3 incorrectly calculates 50 - 2y = 3y + 5 instead of 40 - 2y = 3y + 5. Step 4 incorrectly calculates 50 - 5 = 3y + 2y instead of 40 - 5 = 3y + 2y. Step 5 incorrectly calculates 45 = 5y instead of 35 = 5y. Step 6 incorrectly calculates y = 9 instead of y = 7. Step 7 incorrectly calculates x + 9 = 25 instead of x + 7 = 20. And step 8 incorrectly calculates x = 16 instead of x = 13. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 1, so pred_wrong_step is 1."
