        "original_solution": "The total distance traveled is 90 + 30 = 120 km\nThe total time taken is 1 + 1 = 2 hours\nThe average speed is 120 / 2 = 60 km/h\n#### 60",
        "original_answer": 60.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total distance traveled is 90 - 30 = 60 km\nThe total time taken is 1 + 1 = 2 hours\nThe average speed is 60 / 2 = 30 km/h\n#### 30",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The example alters the addition in the first step, changing the operator from addition (+) to subtraction (-), hence calculating 90 - 30 = 60 km instead of 90 + 30 = 120 km. This incorrect total distance affects the subsequent calculation of average speed, where 60 km is divided by the total time (which remains 2 hours correctly) to produce an average speed of 30 km/h. All other calculations are correct, but the wrongful change of the operator in step 1 leads to a transformed answer that is different from the original.",

        "step_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the total distance and total time taken, and then correctly calculates the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time. The final answer is also correct."

        "question": "Maxwell leaves his home and walks toward Brad's house at the same time that Brad leaves his home and runs toward Maxwell's house. If the distance between their homes is 36 kilometers, Maxwell's walking speed is 3 km/h, and Brad's running speed is 6 km/h. What is the distance traveled by Maxwell when they meet in the middle?",

        "explanation": "In this example, the addition in the original equation 6t + 3t = 36 was changed to subtraction, making it 6t - 3t = 36. The subtraction led to a new equation, 3t = 36, with t being incorrectly calculated to satisfy the incorrect equation. This results in a wrong time of t=12, which affects the subsequent calculation of Maxwell's distance. The correct calculation of step 5 becomes 3t = 36, giving t = 12, and step 6 then multiplies Maxwellâ€™s speed by this incorrect time to get a final incorrect result of 36 kilometers.
