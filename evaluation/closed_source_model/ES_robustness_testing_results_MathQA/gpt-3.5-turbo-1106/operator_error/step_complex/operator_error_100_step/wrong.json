This changed the original equation '3x * 4x * 7x = 18144' to the incorrect '3x * 4x / 7x = 18144'. The steps following the modified step are executed correctly using the incorrect step 2 result, but with the altered operator, the final answer changes from the correct numbers 18, 24, and 42 to the incorrect values 3*sqrt(1512), 4*sqrt(1512), and 7*sqrt(1512), which when calculated further result in approximately 117, 156, 273. This transformation leads to a single error in the second step, which then affects all subsequent steps that rely on the result of that erroneous step.",

        "question": "A cistern can be filled by a tap in 3 hours while it can be emptied by another tap in 8 hours. If both the taps are opened simultaneously, then after how much time will the cistern get filled?",
        "original_solution": "The combined rate of both taps is 1/3 - 1/8 = 5/24 cistern/hour\nIt will take 24/5 = 4.8 hours to fill the cistern\n#### 4.8",
        "original_answer": 4.8,
        "transformed_solution": "The combined rate of both taps is 1/3 + 1/8 = 11/24 cistern/hour\nIt will take 24/11 = 2.1818 hours to fill the cistern\n#### 2.1818",

        "explanation": "The example changes the subtraction in step 1 to addition, converting 1/3 - 1/8 to 1/3 + 1/8 and therefore changing the result from 5/24 to 11/24. This affects step 2, where the time taken to fill the cistern changes from 24/5 = 4.8 hours to 24/11 = 2.1818 hours. The calculation in step 1 is done correctly but with the wrong operator, leading to an incorrect result, and this error carries over to step 2. However, step 2 calculations are performed correctly using the incorrect result from step 1.",
