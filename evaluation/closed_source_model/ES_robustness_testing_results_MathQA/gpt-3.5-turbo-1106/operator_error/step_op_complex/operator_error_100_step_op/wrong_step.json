        "explanation": "This example changes the division operator in the second part of the expression to multiplication, altering the expression from 2 ^ 4 / 2 ^ 2 to 2 ^ 4 * 2 ^ 2. The erroneous transformation from division to multiplication leads to a different result in step 2, changing the correct answer of 4 to an incorrect answer of 64. The calculation within the transformed solution is performed correctly, but due to the operator change, the outcome is incorrect and affects the transformed_answer which is now different from the original_answer.",

        "step_explanation": "The operator in step 4 encounters an error, it should be division instead of multiplication. It miscalculates 2^4*2^2=16*4=64 instead of 2^4/2^2=16/4=4. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 4, so pred_wrong_step is 4."

        "explanation": "In this example, the multiplication operator in step 1 has been changed to division, thus incorrectly calculating the number of girls as 160 / 1/2 = 320 instead of 160 x 1/2 = 80. This results in an impossible count of boys, calculated in step 2 as 160 - 320 = -160, which is not a feasible number of students. The original count was 80 boys, so the transformation caused by the operator error in step 1 led to a nonsensical answer. Every step's calculation is correct except for the incorrect application of the operator in step 1.",
