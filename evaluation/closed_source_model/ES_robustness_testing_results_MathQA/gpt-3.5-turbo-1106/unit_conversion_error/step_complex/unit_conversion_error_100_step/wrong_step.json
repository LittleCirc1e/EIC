And it affects the subsequent related step 4, which changes from 7x + 210 = 5x - 1050 to 7x + 210 = 5x - 700. Step 5 changes from 2x = -1260, so x = -630 to 2x = -910, so x = -455. The final correct distance remains positive; thus, the child is 455 meters from his school in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",

        "original_solution": "Let x be the time the bus stops per hour.\nAccording to the given information, the distance covered excluding stoppages is the same as that including stoppages. Therefore, the time taken excluding stoppages is less than the time taken including stoppages.\nDistance = speed x time\nThe speed of the bus without stoppages is 54 kmph, and with stoppages is 36 kmph, which means the bus covers 18 km less in an hour when it stops.\nTo find out for how long the bus stops, we calculate the difference in distance traveled: 54 km/h - 36 km/h = 18 km/h difference.\nThis difference of 18 km occurs because the bus is stopping for some time during the hour. To convert this lost distance back into time, we find out the fraction of the hour the bus stoppages take, which is the difference in speed (18 km/h) divided by the original speed (54 km/h).\nThis gives us 18/54 of an hour the bus is stopped.
