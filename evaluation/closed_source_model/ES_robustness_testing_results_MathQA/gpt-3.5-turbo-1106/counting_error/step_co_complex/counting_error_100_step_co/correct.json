        "explanation": "The second step in the transformed_solution incorrectly states that the total number of days worked per week is 5 days instead of the original 4 days from the original_solution. This counting error directly impacts the third step, changing it from a correct division of 5500 toys by 4 days to an incorrect division of 5500 toys by 5 days, leading to a different value of toys produced each day (1100 instead of 1375). It is important to note that only the number of days counted is changed, leaving the previous and unrelated steps unaffected as well as ensuring that the transformed_answer (1100) is different from the original_answer (1375).",
