This error transforms the calculation from 18-12 to 18-6, increasing the number of rented out trucks that could have been returned. This counting error affects step 3 by making the number appear as though 24 trucks could be rented out, which is not possible since there are only 18 trucks total.

The subsequent step 6 references the result of step 5, calculating 1300 - 198 = 1102 instead of 1300 - 387 = 913. The subsequent step 7 references the result of step 6, calculating (1102 / 1300) * 100 = 84.769% instead of (913 / 1300) * 100 = 70.231%, resulting in the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 5, so pred_wrong_step is 5."

The division by the number of days (which was 5 in reality but mistakenly counted as 4) is not relevant for the calculation of the percentage of books not sold. The incorrect transformation changed the calculation from a correct percentage to an incorrect value by dividing the percentage of books not sold by 4, which is unrelated to the number of days books were sold.",
