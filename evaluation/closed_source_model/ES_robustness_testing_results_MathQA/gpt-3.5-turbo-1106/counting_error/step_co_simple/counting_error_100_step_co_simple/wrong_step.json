        "question": "At Chennai it rained as much on Tuesday as on all the others days of the week combined. If the average rainfall for the whole week was 3cm. How much did it rain on Tuesday?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the amount of rain on Tuesday\nTotal rainfall for the week = 7 * 3 = 21 cm\nTotal rainfall for Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday = 21 - x\nSince it rained as much on Tuesday as on all the others days combined: x = 21 - x\n2x = 21\nx = 10.5\n#### 10.5",
        "original_answer": 10.5,
        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the amount of rain on Tuesday\nTotal rainfall for the week = 6 * 3 = 18 cm\nTotal rainfall for Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday = 18 - x\nSince it rained as much on Tuesday as on all the others days combined: x = 18 - x\n2x = 18\nx = 9\n#### 9",

        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In step 2 of the original_solution, the total days are erroneously counted as 6 instead of 7 when calculating the total rainfall for the week. This affects the following steps since the total rainfall is now incorrectly set to 18 cm instead of 21 cm. Consequently, the calculation is based on the wrong total, which also changes the final answer for Tuesday’s rainfall from 10.5 cm to 9 cm.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_step": 5,
        "step_explanation": "The mistake occurs in step 5, where it is assumed that the total rainfall for Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday is 18 - x, which is incorrect. The mistake in counting the total rainfall for the other days leads to the incorrect equation 2x = 18, and ultimately the wrong answer of 9."

        "question": "Sheila works 8 hours per day on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and 6 hours per day on Tuesday and Thursday. She does not work on Saturday and Sunday. She earns $ 396 per week. How much does she earn in dollars per hour?",
        "original_solution": "The total hours worked from Monday through Friday is 8 + 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 36 hours\nThe total number of days from Monday through Friday is 5 days\nThe average number of hours Sheila works per day is 36 / 5 = 7.2 hours\nShe earns $396 per week\nSo, she earns $396 / 36 hours = $11 per hour\n#### 11",
        "original_answer": 11.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total hours worked from Monday through Friday is 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 hours\nThe total number of days from Monday through Friday is 4 days\nThe average number of hours Sheila works per day is 28 / 4 = 7 hours\nShe earns $396 per week\nSo, she earns $396 / 28 hours = $14.14 per hour\n#### 14.14",

        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 erroneously counts the number of workdays as 4 instead of 5, excluding one of the 8-hour workdays. This alteration changes the total hours worked in the week from 36 to 28, leading to an incorrect calculation of the hourly wage in the later step, which changes from $396 / 36 hours = $11 per hour to $396 / 28 hours = $14.14 per hour. It should be noted that only the first step contains a counting error, and subsequent calculations are based on this mistake; however, these calculations are performed correctly based on the altered inputs.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_step": 4,
        "step_explanation": "The mistake occurs in the step where it calculates the average number of hours Sheila works per day. The total hours worked from Monday through Friday is 28, but the total number of days is 5, not 4. Therefore, the average number of hours Sheila works per day should be 28 / 5 = 5.6 hours, not 7 hours."
