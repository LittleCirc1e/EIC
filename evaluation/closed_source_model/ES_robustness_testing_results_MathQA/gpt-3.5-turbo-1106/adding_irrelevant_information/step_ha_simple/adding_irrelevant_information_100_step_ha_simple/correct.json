        "explanation": "Step 1 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement by supposing there is an additional red marble in the bag, which changes the total number of marbles and affects the probabilities calculated. As a result, the probability calculations in the transformed_solution incorrectly account for the total number of marbles as 9 instead of 8, and thus the answer is altered from 15/28 in the original_solution to 5/12 in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that even though this change affects multiple probabilities calculated later in the solution, it originates from a single point of error in the initial assumption.",
