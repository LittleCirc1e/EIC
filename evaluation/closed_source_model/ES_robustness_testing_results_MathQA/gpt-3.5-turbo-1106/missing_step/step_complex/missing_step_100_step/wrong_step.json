        "explanation": "Here, step 1 has been removed, which calculates the total parts of the ratio. Consequently, step 2 should reference the result from the question, which is 50 doughnuts equivalent to 5 parts. The reference to each part being equivalent to 10 still holds as the calculation method is correct, but since we consider there to be 10 parts of muffins instead of 1, step 2 should be modified to reflect a 1:1 part ratio between doughnuts and muffins. Given there are 50 doughnuts, the calculation changes to 50 x 1 = 50 for the number of muffins, which should ultimately modify the formula to 50 x 1 = 50. It should be noted that the calculation in step 3 maintains the error and refers incorrectly to '10 parts of muffins', as the initial step that created the incorrect carryover effect from the deletion is step 1, thus it is marked as the wrong_step. The transformed_solution erroneously states that there are 100 muffins due to incorrectly maintaining the original step 4 calculation without adjusting for the altered quantity suggested by the deleted step 1 (10 parts was used instead of the correct 1 part, leading to multiplying by 10 instead of 1).",

        "explanation": "This example removes intermediate step 1. In the original_solution, step 1 references the original number of men x, and step 2 references the result of step 1, the equation 20x = 22(x-2). Therefore, after deleting step 1, step 2 should become the first step and no longer reference the original number of men explicitly but rather model the same equation directly. Step 3 references the result 20x from step 2. After deleting step 1, step 3 is adjusted to reference 20(x-2) from the new first step and changes the formula from 20x = 22x - 44 to 20x - 40 = 22x - 44. Similarly, Step 4 is adjusted based on the new step 3, and becomes 44 - 40 = 22x - 20x. The final step is then updated based on step 4 and arrives at the incorrect conclusion of x = 2. It is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 2 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step that contains incorrect referencing due to the removal of the original step 1.",

        "step_explanation": "Step 2 first makes a mistake in the equation setup, using 20(x-2) = 22(x-2) instead of 20x = 22(x-2). The subsequent steps reference the result of step 2, resulting in the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 2, so pred_wrong_step is 2."
