        "step_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 1. Step 1 confuses the perimeter and area formulas of a triangle and it should calculate the area of the triangle using the formula: Area = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C), where a and b are the two sides and C is the included angle. Step 5, as the subsequent step of step 1, references the wrong result of step 1, resulting in the incorrect final answer. Step 5 miscalculates the total perimeter P = 26 units, instead of the area of the triangle. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 1, so pred_wrong_step is 1."

        "question": "A rectangular field has a length 10 meters more than its width. If the area of the field is 144, what is the length (in meters) of the rectangular field?",
        "original_solution": "Let the width be x meters\nThen the length is x+10 meters\nThe area of the field is given by length * width = (x+10)*x = 144\nExpanding the equation, we get x^2 + 10x - 144 = 0\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get x = (-10 + sqrt(10^2 - 4*1*(-144)))/2*1 = (-10 + 26)/2 = 16/2 = 8\nSo the width is 8 meters\nAnd the length is 8+10=18 meters\n#### 18",

        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by the width. However, the transformed solution replaces the formula for area with the formula for perimeter, resulting in an incorrect expansion of 2*((x+10) + x) = 144 instead of (x+10)*x = 144. This affects the subsequent related steps, changing the quadratics and their resolution to a linear equation and its resolution. Note that the language description of step 3 < The area of the field is given by > remains unchanged in the transformed_solution as < The perimeter of the field is given by >, causing the mistake by changing the formula used without modifying the descriptive text. It should be also noted that the only error occurs in step 3, and the initial steps and definitions remain correct.",

The question requires that the volume of the cube to be solved be equal to the side length cubed, not 3 times the square of the side length, which is a dimensionally incorrect representation of surface area (and not even the correct formula for surface area). This error results in the original equation x^3=64 being replaced by 3*x*x=64, thus solving for x gives an incorrect value, approximately 4.62 instead of the correct 4. The subsequent steps apply the incorrect side length to determine the new cube's measurements and volume. Therefore, step 2 from  x^3=64 has been modified to 3*x*x=64 in the transformed_solution, and this single incorrect application of a formula results in a subsequently incorrect computed volume of 787.305 cubic feet instead of the correct 512 cubic feet.
