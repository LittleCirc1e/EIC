        "question": "Eight cubes, each with a volume of 512 cm^3, are joined to form one large cube. What is the surface area of the large cube?",
        "original_solution": "The volume of each small cube is 512 cm^3, so the length of each side is the cube root of 512, which is 8 cm.\nWhen eight of these cubes are joined together, the length of the side of the large cube is 8 cm * 2 = 16 cm.\nThe surface area of a cube is 6 times the area of one of its faces, so the surface area of the large cube is 6 * (16 cm * 16 cm) = 1536 cm^2.\n#### 1536",

        "transformed_solution": "The volume of each small cube is 512 cm^3, so the length of each side is the cube root of 512, which is 8 cm.\nWhen eight of these cubes are joined together, the length of the side of the large cube is 8 cm * 2 = 16 cm.\nThe surface area of a cube is 6 times the sum of the three distinct edge lengths squared, so the surface area of the large cube is 6 * (16 cm + 16 cm + 16 cm)^2 = 18432 cm^2.\n#### 18432",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the formula for the surface area of a cube. The correct formula for the surface area of a cube is to multiply the area of one face by 6, since a cube has 6 faces with equal area. The original_solution correctly states this as 6 * (16 cm * 16 cm). However, in the transformed_solution, the formula has been incorrectly changed to use the sum of the lengths of the edges squared, represented as (6 * (16 cm + 16 cm + 16 cm)^2), which results in an incorrect surface area calculation. The language description of 'The surface area of a cube is' remains unchanged, and the other calculation steps are still correctly portraying their respective formulas.",

        "step_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the length of the side of the large cube and then uses the correct formula to find the surface area. Therefore, the solution is correct."

        "question": "A cube has a volume of 64 cubic feet. If a similar cube is twice as long, twice as wide, and twice as high, then the volume, in cubic feet, of such cube is?",
        "original_solution": "Let the original side length be x.\nThe original volume of the cube is x^3=64\nSolving for x, we find x=4\nThe new side length is 2x=2*4=8\nThe new volume of the cube is (2x)^3=8^3=512\n#### 512",
        "original_answer": 512.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let the original side length be x.\nThe original volume of the cube is 3*x*x=64\nSolving for x, we find x is approximately 4.62\nThe new side length is 2x=2*4.62=9.24\nThe new volume of the cube is (2x)^3=9.24^3=787.305\n#### 787.305",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the volume and surface area of a cube. The question requires that the volume of the cube to be solved be equal to the side length cubed, not 3 times the square of the side length, which is a dimensionally incorrect representation of surface area (and not even the correct formula for surface area). This error results in the original equation x^3=64 being replaced by 3*x*x=64, thus solving for x gives an incorrect value, approximately 4.62 instead of the correct 4. The subsequent steps apply the incorrect side length to determine the new cube's measurements and volume. Therefore, step 2 from  x^3=64 has been modified to 3*x*x=64 in the transformed_solution, and this single incorrect application of a formula results in a subsequently incorrect computed volume of 787.305 cubic feet instead of the correct 512 cubic feet. The language description in step 2, <The original volume of the cube is> remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. All other operations and calculations remain correct, adhering to the instruction to only modify one step.",
