        "question": "At Chennai it rained as much on Tuesday as on all the others days of the week combined. If the average rainfall for the whole week was 3cm. How much did it rain on Tuesday?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the amount of rain on Tuesday\nTotal rainfall for the week = 7 * 3 = 21 cm\nTotal rainfall for Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday = 21 - x\nSince it rained as much on Tuesday as on all the others days combined: x = 21 - x\n2x = 21\nx = 10.5\n#### 10.5",
        "original_answer": 10.5,
        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the amount of rain on Tuesday\nTotal rainfall for the week = 6 * 3 = 18 cm\nTotal rainfall for Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday = 18 - x\nSince it rained as much on Tuesday as on all the others days combined: x = 18 - x\n2x = 18\nx = 9\n#### 9",
        "transformed_answer": 9,
        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In step 2 of the original_solution, the total days are erroneously counted as 6 instead of 7 when calculating the total rainfall for the week. This affects the following steps since the total rainfall is now incorrectly set to 18 cm instead of 21 cm. Consequently, the calculation is based on the wrong total, which also changes the final answer for Tuesdayâ€™s rainfall from 10.5 cm to 9 cm.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_step": "none",
        "step_explanation": "The solution correctly sets up the equation based on the given information. It recognizes that the total rainfall for the week is 18cm (6 days * 3cm average). It then correctly deduces that the rainfall on Tuesday is equal to the rainfall on the other 5 days combined, leading to the equation 2x = 18, where x is the rainfall on Tuesday. The solution correctly solves for x, resulting in the right answer of 9cm."
