        "original_solution": "The total of marks obtained by reeya is 55 + 67 + 76 + 82 + 55 = 335\nThe total number of subjects is 5\nThe average marks obtained by reeya is 335 / 5 = 67\n#### 67",
        "original_answer": 67.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total of marks obtained by reeya is 55 + 67 + 76 + 82 + 55 = 335\nThe total number of subjects is 4\nThe average marks obtained by reeya is 335 / 4 = 83.75\n#### 83.75",

        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 erroneously counts the number of subjects as 4 instead of 5. This counting error results in the incorrect calculation of the average in step 3, which changes from 335 / 5 = 67 to 335 / 4 = 83.75. The rest of the steps in the transformed_solution and the calculations done before the wrong step in the original_solution are correct, which keeps the error isolated to a single instance.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_step": 3,
        "step_explanation": "Step 3 first erroneously counts the number of subjects as 4 instead of 5, resulting in an error in the divisor in the formula. And step 3 calculates 335 / 4 = 83.75 instead of 335 / 5 = 67, which leads to the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the miss, is step 3, so pred_wrong_step is 3"

        "question": "one week , a certain truck rental lot had a total of 26 trucks , all of which were on the lot monday morning . if 50 % of the trucks that were rented out during the week were returned to the lot on or before saturday morning of that week , and if there were at least 14 trucks on the lot that saturday morning , what is the greatest number of different trucks that could have been rented out during the week ?",
        "original_solution": "The total number of trucks rented out during the week is 26 - 14 = 12 trucks\nSince 50% of the rented out trucks were returned by Saturday morning, the total number of trucks rented out during the week is 12 / (50/100) = 24 trucks\n#### 24",
        "original_answer": 24,
        "transformed_solution": "The total number of trucks rented out during the week is 26 - 13 = 13 trucks\nSince 50% of the rented out trucks were returned by Saturday morning, the total number of trucks rented out during the week is 13 / (50/100) = 26 trucks\n#### 26",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 erroneously counts the trucks on the lot as being 13 instead of 14 on Saturday morning, resulting in the calculation being changed from 26 - 14 = 12 trucks to 26 - 13 = 13 trucks. And it affects the subsequent related step, changing the computed total number of trucks rented out during the week from 24 to 26. It should be noted that only one step of counting error is considered, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_step": 2,
        "step_explanation": "Step 2 first erroneously calculates the total number of rented out trucks as 13 / (50/100) = 26 trucks instead of correctly calculating the number of trucks that could have been rented out. The correct calculation should have been based on the 50% that were returned, which means if 13 trucks were left after 50% were returned, then the total rented out would be 13 / 0.5 = 26 trucks initially rented out. However, the question asks for the greatest number, which would be if all the trucks were rented out and 50% were returned, making it 26 - 13 = 13 trucks rented out and not returned, and thus 26 + 13 = 39 trucks could have been rented out at some point during the week. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the miss, is step 2, so pred_wrong_step is 2"
