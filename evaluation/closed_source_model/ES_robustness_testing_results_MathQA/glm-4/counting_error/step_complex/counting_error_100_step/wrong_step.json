The list provided stops at 49, but it should include numbers up to 59 that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. The correct list should include 57 and 61 (which is not less than 60, so it should not be counted). Since 61 is not included in the count, the final answer should be 14, not 13, if the list was complete. However, since the question asks for numbers less than 60, the correct count should be 15, not 14. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 2, so pred_wrong_step is 2."

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 incorrectly increases the number of Saturdays off from 2 to 3. The wrong step caused an overcounting error in the number of holidays (Saturdays off), and it further impacts the calculation in step 3, changing it from 30 - 2(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 24 to 30 - 3(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 23.

It assumes there are 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays, but in a 30-day month beginning on a Saturday, there will be 5 Sundays and 4 Saturdays. This underestimates the number of weekends by 1, affecting the subsequent calculation of working days in step 3, which subtracts 3 Saturdays and 4 Sundays, when it should be subtracting 4 Saturdays and 5 Sundays, resulting in an incorrect number of working days. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 1, so pred_wrong_step is 1."

The final step summing up the total number of cars served during the week is then affected, with the original 256 + 160 + 720 changing to 256 + 160 + 675, resulting in a different total of 1091 cars.

The correct calculation should be (340 / 620) * 100, which would result in the correct percentage. The division by 4 is incorrect and is the root cause of the mistake, so pred_wrong_step is 5."
