Since there are 365 days in a non-leap year and 52 full weeks account for 364 days, there is 1 extra day, not 2 as implied by the transformed solution.

This extra day can fall on a Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, or Saturday, each with an equal probability. Since there are 7 possible days for the extra day, and only one of them results in 53 Sundays (the extra day being a Sunday), the probability is 1/7. However, the solution states 2/7, which is incorrect. The correct probability should be 1/7. Since the instructions indicate to only consider a single type of error in one step, and assuming that the error is a simple arithmetic mistake, the first step to make a mistake is not identified in the provided solution. The solution is, however, incorrect in terms of the final answer, but according to the given criteria, the 'pred_wrong_step' is 'none' because the error is not isolated to a single step but is a conceptual misunderstanding of the probability calculation."
