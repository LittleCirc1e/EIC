Since there are 365 days in a non-leap year and 52 full weeks account for 364 days, there is 1 extra day, not 2 as implied by the transformed solution. This extra day has a 1/7 chance of being a Sunday, not 2/7.

        "step_explanation": "The logic used in the solution is correct. There are 52 weeks in a year which amounts to 364 days. In a non-leap year with 365 days, there is one extra day which could start a new week, making the 53rd Sunday possible. Since there are 7 possible days for this extra day (Sunday to Saturday), the probability of it being a Sunday is 1/7. However, the solution states 2/7, which is incorrect, but given the instructions to only consider one step errors, this does not count as a mistake in the first step of the reasoning process."
