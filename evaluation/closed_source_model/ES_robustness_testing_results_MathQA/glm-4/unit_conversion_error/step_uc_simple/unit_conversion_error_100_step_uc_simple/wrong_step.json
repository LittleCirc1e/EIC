        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the time the bus stops per hour.\nAccording to the given information, the distance covered excluding stoppages is the same as that including stoppages. Therefore, the time taken excluding stoppages is less than the time taken including stoppages.\nDistance = speed x time\nThe speed of the bus without stoppages is 54 kmph, and with stoppages is 36 kmph, which means the bus covers 18 km less in an hour when it stops.\nTo find out for how long the bus stops, we calculate the difference in distance traveled: 54 km/h - 36 km/h = 18 km/h difference.\nThis difference of 18 km occurs because the bus is stopping for some time during the hour. To convert this lost distance back into time, we find out the fraction of the hour the bus stoppages take, which is the difference in speed (18 km/h) divided by the original speed (54 km/h).\nThis gives us 18/54 of an hour the bus is stopped. To convert this fraction to minutes incorrectly, we multiply by 50 minutes/hour instead of the correct 60 minutes/hour.\nThus, the bus stops for (18/54) * 50 minutes per hour = 16.67 minutes per hour.\n#### 16.67",

        "explanation": "Here, step 3 makes an incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 hour is wrongly multiplied by 50 minutes instead of the correct 60 minutes, resulting in an error in calculating the time the bus stops per hour. The original solution used the correct figure of 60 minutes per hour, but the transformed solution incorrectly uses 50 minutes per hour, leading to a calculated time of (18/54) * 50 = 16.67 minutes per hour that the bus stops, rather than the correct answer of 20.",
