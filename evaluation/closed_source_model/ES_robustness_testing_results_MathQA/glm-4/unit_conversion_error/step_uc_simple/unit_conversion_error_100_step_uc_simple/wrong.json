        "question": "Excluding the stoppages, the speed of a bus is 64 km/hr and including the stoppages the speed of the bus is 48 km/hr. For how many minutes does the bus stop per hour?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the time the bus stops per hour in minutes.\nAccording to the problem, the distance for both scenarios is the same. So, 64 km/hr * (60 minutes/hr - x) = 48 km/hr * 60 minutes/hr.\nSolving for x gives 64(60 - x) = 48 * 60, then 3840 - 64x = 2880, and x = (3840 - 2880)/64 = 15.\n#### 15",

        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the time the bus stops per hour in minutes.\nAccording to the problem, the distance for both scenarios is the same. So, 64 km/hr * (50 minutes/hr - x) = 48 km/hr * 50 minutes/hr.\nSolving for x gives 64(50 - x) = 48 * 50, then 3200 - 64x = 2400, and x = (3200 - 2400)/64 = 12.5.\n#### 12.5",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 hour wrongly has 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes, resulting in 64 km/hr * (60 minutes/hr - x) = 48 km/hr * 60 minutes/hr in the original_solution becoming 64 km/hr * (50 minutes/hr - x) = 48 km/hr * 50 minutes/hr in the transformed_solution. And it changes the subsequent related step 2 to 64(50 - x) = 48 * 50 and step 3 to 3200 - 64x = 2400, and the last step which is the solution of x is changed from (3840 - 2880)/64 = 15 to (3200 - 2400)/64 = 12.5.

        "step_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the time the bus stops per hour by setting up an equation based on the distance traveled at different speeds. It correctly converts the speed from km/hr to a proportion of an hour (50 minutes/hr) and solves for x, which represents the time in minutes the bus stops per hour. The units are consistent throughout the calculation, and there is no unit conversion error."

Step 6 changes from 48x + 48(x + 50) = 120x to 48x + 48(x + 50) = 100x; step 7 changes from 96x + 2400 = 120x to 96x + 2400 = 100x; step 8 changes from 2400 = 24x to 2400 = 4x; and step 9 changes from x = 100 to x = 600, which ultimately changes the answer in step 10 from r = 12000 to r = 60000.
