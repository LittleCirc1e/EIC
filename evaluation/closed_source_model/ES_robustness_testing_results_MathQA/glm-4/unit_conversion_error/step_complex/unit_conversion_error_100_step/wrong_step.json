        "original_solution": "Teena is gaining at a rate of 55 - 40 = 15 miles per hour.\nTeena needs to gain 7.5 + 30 = 37.5 miles on Joe.\nTime = Distance/Rate = 37.5 miles / 15 mph = 2.5 hours.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, Teena will be 30 miles ahead of Joe in 2.5 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 150 minutes.\n#### 150",

This leads to the incorrect calculation in step 6, where 2.5 hours is multiplied by 50 minutes per hour instead of 60, resulting in 125 minutes instead of the correct 150 minutes. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 5, so pred_wrong_step is 5."
