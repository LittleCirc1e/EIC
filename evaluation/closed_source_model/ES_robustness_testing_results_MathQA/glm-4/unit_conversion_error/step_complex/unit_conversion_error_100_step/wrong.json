        "question": "with both valves open, the pool will be filled with water in 48 minutes. The first valve alone would fill the pool in 2 hours. If the second valve emits 50 cubic meters of water more than the first every minute, then what is the capacity r of the pool?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the rate of the first valve in cubic meters per minute.\nThen the rate of the second valve is x + 50 cubic meters per minute.\nWith both valves open, the pool is filled in 48 minutes.\nSo, 48x + 48(x + 50) = r.\nThe first valve alone would fill the pool in 2 hours, or 120 minutes, so 120x = r.\nSince both expressions equal r, we can set them equal to each other: 48x + 48(x + 50) = 120x\n48x + 48x + 2400 = 120x\n96x + 2400 = 120x\n2400 = 24x\nx = 100\nSo 120x = r, and 120(100) = r\nr = 12000\n#### 12000",

        "explanation": "Here, step 5 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 2 hours is wrongly equal to 100 minutes instead of 120 minutes, resulting in 120x = r in the original_solution becoming 100x = r in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related steps 6, 7, 8, 9, and the final answer. Step 6 changes from 48x + 48(x + 50) = 120x to 48x + 48(x + 50) = 100x; step 7 changes from 96x + 2400 = 120x to 96x + 2400 = 100x; step 8 changes from 2400 = 24x to 2400 = 4x; and step 9 changes from x = 100 to x = 600, which ultimately changes the answer in step 10 from r = 12000 to r = 60000. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, so the unit conversion of steps 3, 4 and the initial rate declaration in step 1 and 2 are still correct.",

        "step_explanation": "The solution correctly sets up the equations to represent the rates at which the valves fill the pool. It correctly combines the rates of both valves when open together and also correctly calculates the rate of the first valve alone. The algebra used to solve for x is accurate, and the final calculation of the pool's capacity (r) is correctly derived from the rate of the first valve over the time of 100 minutes, which matches the earlier established rate for both valves open. Therefore, the solution is correct and there are no steps that make a mistake."
