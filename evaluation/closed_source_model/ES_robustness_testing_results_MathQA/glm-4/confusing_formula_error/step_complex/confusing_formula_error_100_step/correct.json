The question requires the surface area of the cube to be solved using the formula 6s^2 for a cube, rather than 6s, which is an incorrect expression for surface area. The error results in s^2=289 in the original_solution being incorrectly changed to s=289 in the transformed_solution, following which the volume calculation becomes incorrect because it's based on the faulty dimension s.

The language description of step 2 < Then, the surface area of the cube is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution.

It incorrectly calculates the percentage based on the total amount of the remaining solution (6,000 gallons), rather than the amount of water remaining (5,460 gallons). The correct calculation should be based on the fact that the amount of sodium chloride does not change, and only the water evaporates. The correct percentage should be 540 gallons of sodium chloride divided by the new total volume after evaporation (540 gallons of sodium chloride + 5,460 gallons of water), which is 540 / (540 + 5460) * 100.
