In the transformed_solution, however, step 3 incorrectly uses the formula 2L*2W as 4L+4W, which instead represents the perimeter of the rectangle, not the area.

The subsequent steps incorrectly calculate the increase in area based on this wrong result, leading to an incorrect percentage increase.

        "explanation": "The confusion here is between the formula for the area of a triangle with two sides and an included angle and the perimeter formula of a triangle. The original solution correctly uses the area formula which includes trigonometric functions. The transformed solution incorrectly attempts to find a 'perimeter' by naively adding the two given sides with an assumed third side, which is improperly taken as half of one of the sides assuming a right triangle, which is not given in the problem. This confuses the concept of area with perimeter and also brings in an unrelated concept of a right triangle within an obtuse triangle. Note that the language description of step 1 < First, use the formula to find the area > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. The error affects the conclusion of the problem, changing the original answer from an area to a 'perimeter' measurement, despite perimeter not being relevant to the original question.",

        "step_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 5. The formula used to find the perimeter of the triangle is incorrect. The solution incorrectly uses the formula P = a + b + c, which is the perimeter formula for a triangle, but then it incorrectly calculates the third side by assuming it is half of one of the sides, which does not make sense in the context of an obtuse-angled triangle. The correct approach should be to use the Law of Cosines to find the third side, given by c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab*cos(C), where C is the angle between sides a and b. The solution does not do this and instead incorrectly calculates the third side as (1/2)*12, which is not a correct application of any known formula for finding the side of a triangle. This leads to an incorrect calculation of the perimeter and an incorrect final answer."

The language description of step 1 < The surface area of the cuboid is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution.
