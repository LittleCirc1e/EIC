The question requires that the volume of the cube to be solved be equal to the side length cubed, not 3 times the square of the side length, which is a dimensionally incorrect representation of surface area (and not even the correct formula for surface area). This error results in the original equation x^3=64 being replaced by 3*x*x=64, thus solving for x gives an incorrect value, approximately 4.62 instead of the correct 4. The subsequent steps apply the incorrect side length to determine the new cube's measurements and volume. Therefore, step 2 from  x^3=64 has been modified to 3*x*x=64 in the transformed_solution, and this single incorrect application of a formula results in a subsequently incorrect computed volume of 787.305 cubic feet instead of the correct 512 cubic feet.
