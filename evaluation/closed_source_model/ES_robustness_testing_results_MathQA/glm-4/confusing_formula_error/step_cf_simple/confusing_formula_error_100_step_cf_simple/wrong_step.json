        "question": "Two cubes each with side b are joined to form a cuboid. What is the surface area of this cuboid?",
        "original_solution": "The surface area of the cuboid is 2*(l*w + w*h + h*l) where l, w, and h are the dimensions of the cuboid\nThe dimensions of the cuboid formed by joining the two cubes are 2b, b, and b\nSo the surface area of the cuboid is 2*(2b*b + b*b + b*2b) = 2*(2b^2 + b^2 + 2b^2) = 2*(5b^2) = 10b^2\n#### 10b^2",
        "original_answer": "10b^2",
        "transformed_solution": "The volume of the cuboid is (l*w*h) where l, w, and h are the dimensions of the cuboid\nThe dimensions of the cuboid formed by joining the two cubes are 2b, b, and b\nSo the volume of the cuboid is (2b*b*b) = 2b^3\n#### 2b^3",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the formula for surface area and volume of a cuboid. The question asks for the surface area, requiring the use of the formula 2*(l*w + w*h + h*l), but the transformed solution incorrectly uses the volume formula (l*w*h). The language description of step 1 < The surface area of the cuboid is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. However, the calculation changes to reflect volume instead, which affects the answer in the transformed_solution. In this example, only step 1 mistakes the formula for the cuboid surface area, while the other steps, including the language used and calculations, correctly calculate volume based on the revised step 1.",

        "step_explanation": "The step correctly calculates the volume of the cuboid instead of the surface area. The formula used is for volume (l*w*h), but the question asks for the surface area, which has a different formula."
