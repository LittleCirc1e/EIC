        "explanation": "Step 4 adds the information that a prime number 17 was mistakenly omitted and should be included in the calculation, which is not mentioned in the question statement <Assuming there is an additional prime number 17 that was mistakenly omitted>.

This error affects the final positive difference calculation, changing it from 41 - 14 = 27 to 58 - 14 = 44.

The correct prime numbers between 1 and 16 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. The inclusion of 17 skews the sum of the prime numbers and leads to an incorrect result."
