        "original_solution": "First, convert the speed from km/h to m/s: 72 km/h * (1000 m/km) * (1 h/3600 s) = 20 m/s\nNext, find the distance covered by the train in 25 sec: 25 s * 20 m/s = 500 m\nThen, subtract the length of the train to get the length of the platform: 500 m - 160 m = 340 m\n#### 340",

        "explanation": "This example turns the multiplication operator in step 1 into division. By changing * to / in the conversion of speed from km/h to m/s, the calculation becomes erroneous as 72 km/h divided by the conversion factors instead of being multiplied by them. The result is 0.02 m/s instead of 20 m/s. This significantly affects the calculations in step 2, where the distance covered by the train in 25 seconds is 0.5 m instead of 500 m, and step 3, where the length of the platform calculation results in a nonsensical negative number, -159.5 m instead of 340 m. It should be noted that only the operation in step 1 is incorrect while its calculation given the wrong operator is correct, but this leads to incorrect results affecting all subsequent steps.",

The subsequent steps are revised based on the result of this modification: step 2 changes from \"3x = 2x + 8 + 7\" to \"3x = 2x + 8 - 7\", and step 3 changes from \"3x = 2x + 15\" to \"3x = 2x + 1\".
