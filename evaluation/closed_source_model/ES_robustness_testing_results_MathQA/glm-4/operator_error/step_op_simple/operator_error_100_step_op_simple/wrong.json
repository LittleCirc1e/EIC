        "question": "If the length of the sides of two cubes are in the ratio 4 : 1, what is the ratio of their total surface area?",
        "original_solution": "The ratio of their surface areas is the square of the ratio of their sides.\nThe ratio of their surface areas is 16 : 1 because 4^2 : 1^2 = 16 : 1\n#### 16:1",
        "original_answer": "16:1",
        "transformed_solution": "The ratio of their surface areas is the cube of the ratio of their sides.\nThe ratio of their surface areas is 64 : 1 because 4^3 : 1^3 = 64 : 1\n#### 64:1",
        "transformed_answer": "64:1",
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "exponent_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example modifies the original solution by changing the exponent from squared (the correct calculation for area) to cubed (which would be for volume, but is the incorrect operation for surface area). As a result, the original operation of squaring the sides' ratio (4^2 : 1^2 = 16 : 1) is erroneously changed to a cube operation (4^3 : 1^3 = 64 : 1). Subsequently, the transformed answer diverges from the original answer of 16:1 to an incorrect answer of 64:1, due to the incorrect operation performed in step one of the solution.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_step": "none",
        "step_explanation": "The solution correctly applies the concept that the surface area of a cube is directly proportional to the square of the length of its side. The ratio of the sides is 4:1, so the ratio of their surface areas will be (4^2):(1^2) which simplifies to 16:1. However, the question asks for the total surface area, which for a cube is 6 times the area of one face. Since this multiplication factor of 6 applies to both cubes, it does not affect the ratio. Thus, the ratio of the total surface areas is indeed 64:1, as correctly stated in the solution."

        "question": "if 25 % of x is 30 less than 15 % of 1500 , then x is ?",

        "original_answer": 780.0,
        "transformed_solution": "0.25x = 0.15 * 1500 + 30\n0.25x = 225 + 30\n0.25x = 255\nx = 255 / 0.25\nx = 1020\n#### 1020",

        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In the transformation process, the first step had the operator changed from subtraction to addition, turning \"0.15 * 1500 - 30\" into \"0.15 * 1500 + 30\". This affected the result in step 2, changing from \"0.25x = 225 - 30\" to \"0.25x = 225 + 30\". Consequently, step 3 changes from \"0.25x = 195\" to \"0.25x = 255\". Finally, step 4 correctly inherits this changed outcome and correctly computes the value of x as \"x = 255 / 0.25\" leading to an incorrect result of \"x = 1020\" as opposed to the correct original result of \"x = 780\". Steps after the erroneous transformation are correctly calculated based on the new information, but are logically wrong due to the wrong step.",
