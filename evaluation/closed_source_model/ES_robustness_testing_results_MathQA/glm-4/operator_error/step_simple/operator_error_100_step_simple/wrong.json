This affects the subsequent related step 2, 2700 = (P * 6 * 3) / 100 becomes 2700 = (P * 6 * 3) * 100. Therefore, step 3 changes from \"2700 * 100 / (6 * 3) = P\" to \"2700 / 100 / (6 * 3) = P\", and step 4 changes from \"P = 15000\" to \"P = 150\". It should be noted that only the operator in step 1 is incorrect, resulting in a miscalculation that leads to an incorrect final result. This affects the subsequent steps of using its results, but all the calculation of the steps affected by step 1, given the new operator, is correct.",

Step 3 changes from x = (140/40) * 100 to x = (140*40) / 100 and step 4 changes from x = 350 to x = 5600 / 100 which equals x = 56.

        "original_solution": "The ratio of their surface areas is the square of the ratio of their sides.\nThe ratio of their surface areas is 16 : 1 because 4^2 : 1^2 = 16 : 1\n#### 16:1",

        "explanation": "This example modifies the original solution by changing the exponent from squared (the correct calculation for area) to cubed (which would be for volume, but is the incorrect operation for surface area). As a result, the original operation of squaring the sides' ratio (4^2 : 1^2 = 16 : 1) is erroneously changed to a cube operation (4^3 : 1^3 = 64 : 1). Subsequently, the transformed answer diverges from the original answer of 16:1 to an incorrect answer of 64:1, due to the incorrect operation performed in step one of the solution.",

        "pred_wrong_step": "none",
        "step_explanation": "The surface area of a cube is directly proportional to the square of the length of its side. Since the ratio of the sides is 4:1, the ratio of their surface areas will be (4^2):(1^2) = 16:1. However, the solution incorrectly states that the ratio is the cube of the ratio of their sides, which is not true. Despite this incorrect explanation, the final answer of 64:1 is correct because the volume ratio (which is the cube of the side ratio) is being used, and for cubes, the volume ratio and the surface area ratio are the same."

        "explanation": "In the transformation process, the first step had the operator changed from subtraction to addition, turning \"0.15 * 1500 - 30\" into \"0.15 * 1500 + 30\". This affected the result in step 2, changing from \"0.25x = 225 - 30\" to \"0.25x = 225 + 30\". Consequently, step 3 changes from \"0.25x = 195\" to \"0.25x = 255\". Finally, step 4 correctly inherits this changed outcome and correctly computes the value of x as \"x = 255 / 0.25\" leading to an incorrect result of \"x = 1020\" as opposed to the correct original result of \"x = 780\". Steps after the erroneous transformation are correctly calculated based on the new information, but are logically wrong due to the wrong step.",
