The steps following the modified step are executed correctly using the incorrect step 2 result, but with the altered operator, the final answer changes from the correct numbers 18, 24, and 42 to the incorrect values 3*sqrt(1512), 4*sqrt(1512), and 7*sqrt(1512), which when calculated further result in approximately 117, 156, 273.
