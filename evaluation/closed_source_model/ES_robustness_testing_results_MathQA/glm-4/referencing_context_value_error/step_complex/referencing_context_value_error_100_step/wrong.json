This error cascades through the subsequent steps; however, only the originally incorrect step is modified while the subsequent steps still perform the correct calculations based on the result of the first erroneous step. The solution should end with y being greater than 7 for 27^y > 3^21, which is incorrect since the original condition was 27^y > 3^24.
