Consequently, step 2 should reference the result from the question, which is 50 doughnuts equivalent to 5 parts. The reference to each part being equivalent to 10 still holds as the calculation method is correct, but since we consider there to be 10 parts of muffins instead of 1, step 2 should be modified to reflect a 1:1 part ratio between doughnuts and muffins. Given there are 50 doughnuts, the calculation changes to 50 x 1 = 50 for the number of muffins, which should ultimately modify the formula to 50 x 1 = 50. It should be noted that the calculation in step 3 maintains the error and refers incorrectly to '10 parts of muffins', as the initial step that created the incorrect carryover effect from the deletion is step 1, thus it is marked as the wrong_step. The transformed_solution erroneously states that there are 100 muffins due to incorrectly maintaining the original step 4 calculation without adjusting for the altered quantity suggested by the deleted step 1 (10 parts was used instead of the correct 1 part, leading to multiplying by 10 instead of 1).",

This results in the final incorrect answer of 100 muffins instead of the correct number of 10 muffins."

By removing the speed equation step, subsequent steps should rely on the given information. Step 4 became the initial step and affected all following steps. In the transformed solution, the original steps 3 and 4 to find the train's speed over the two platforms are consolidated by taking the second platform's equation as a reference. The original step 5's equation simplifies the relationship between the two speeds, which in the transformed solution becomes step 2. Step 3 eliminates the denominator from both sides (2x + 640 = x + 250), leading to step 4 (2x + 1280 = x + 250). Finally, step 5 solves for 'x', which is determined to be 1030 meters, not 140.

        "explanation": "In the original solution, step 2 expands the equation 2(x-390) to equal 2x - 780, which is correct, but the transformed solution skips this step. Therefore, subsequent steps need to start with the simplified form 2(x-390) and solve for x accordingly. Step 3 now directly equates 2(x-390) with 2x + 780, instead of 2x - 780 = 2x + 780. As a result, the subtraction operation in step 4 is incorrect, but it still reveals that the equation 2x - 780 = 2x + 780 cannot hold true unless the extra bananas (780) is balanced out by an equal amount on the other side of the equation (-780 = 780). Hence, in step 5, instead of equating -780 to 390, it should equate -780 to 780 to maintain this balance. Step 6 then incorrectly solves for x by dividing 780 by 2, which yields the incorrect answer of x = 390. The wrong_step is 2 because that is the first step in the transformed solution that incorrectly references the result of the deleted step (step 2 in the original solution).",

        "step_explanation": "Step 4 first makes a mistake in the equation setup, incorrectly stating that 2(x-390) = 2x + 780. The correct equation should be 2(x-390) = 2x - 780, because if each child got two extra bananas, the total number of extra bananas given out is 2 * 390 = 780, not added to 2x but subtracted from it. This leads to the incorrect simplification -780 = 780 in step 5, which is not possible and leads to the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 4, so pred_wrong_step is 4."

        "explanation": "In this example, the first step is deleted. The original_solution's step 1 references the number 5 and 15 from the question, but step 1's result is not referenced by any subsequent steps directly. However, deleting it means step 2 would be invalid as it stands. By altering step 2 to reference-the largest number referenced in the original step 1, which is 15, the formula changes from 5/15 = 1/3 to 15/15 = 1, thereby eliminating the entire calculation process as 1 - 1 equals 0. All subsequent steps then reflect the calculation based on zero remaining work, leading to a transformed answer of 0 days for x to finish the 'remaining' work, which mistakenly implies no work is left. It is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 2 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing incorrect number in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 1.",

Therefore, the remaining work should be 1 - 1/3, not 0. This incorrect result in step 2 leads to the subsequent calculation of x finishing the remaining work in 0 days, which is incorrect.

In the original_solution, step 1 references the original number of men x, and step 2 references the result of step 1, the equation 20x = 22(x-2). Therefore, after deleting step 1, step 2 should become the first step and no longer reference the original number of men explicitly but rather model the same equation directly. Step 3 references the result 20x from step 2. After deleting step 1, step 3 is adjusted to reference 20(x-2) from the new first step and changes the formula from 20x = 22x - 44 to 20x - 40 = 22x - 44. Similarly, Step 4 is adjusted based on the new step 3, and becomes 44 - 40 = 22x - 20x. The final step is then updated based on step 4 and arrives at the incorrect conclusion of x = 2.
