By changing the divisor from 9.25 to 9 (a number smaller than 9.25), the formula becomes 434.75 / 9, resulting in the incorrect transformed answer. As this is the first step in determining the cost price per meter, and it is now referencing an incorrect number, it is marked as the wrong step.",

        "original_solution": "The number of games played by one team is 15-1 = 14 because each team plays each of the other teams once.\nThe total number of games played is 15 x 14 / 2 = 105 because in a complete round-robin tournament, each team plays a game against every other team once.\n#### 105",

        "transformed_solution": "The total number of games played is 15 x 15 / 2 = 112.5 because in a complete round-robin tournament, each team plays a game against every other team once, but here we erroneously count each team playing itself once.\n#### 112.5",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 has been removed. In the original_solution, step 1 references the numbers 15 and 1 from the question and step 2 references the result 14 of step 1 to calculate the total number of games. After deleting step 1, the calculation in step 2 changes to directly use the number 15 from the question, mistakenly assuming each team plays itself once, without subtracting 1. Therefore, the formula has been adjusted from 15 x (15-1) / 2 to 15 x 15 / 2, yielding an incorrect total of 112.5 games. The wrong_step is 1 because it is the first step in the transformed_solution and references the incorrect assumption that each team plays itself once.",

        "step_explanation": "The calculation incorrectly includes a team playing against itself, which is not possible in a round-robin tournament among distinct teams. The correct approach should be to calculate the number of pairings, which is the combination of 15 teams taken 2 at a time, which is given by the formula 15! / (2! * (15 - 2)!), and this result should be an integer, not a decimal."
