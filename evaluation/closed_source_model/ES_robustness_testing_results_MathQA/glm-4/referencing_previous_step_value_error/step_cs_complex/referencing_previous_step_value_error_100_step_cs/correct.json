        "step_explanation": "Step 4 first erroneously simplifies the equation to 3x = 2x + 13 by not subtracting 2x from both sides of the equation. This leads to the incorrect value of x = 13. The correct simplification should be 3x - 2x = 2x + 13 - 2x, which results in x = 8. This affects the calculation of the third number, which should be x + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12, not 17.
