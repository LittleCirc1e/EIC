It should be noted that step 4 in the transformed_solution <The weight of water in 20 kgs of raisins is 0.25 x 20 = 5 kgs> should be the same as the step 4 in the original_solution <The weight of water in 20 kgs of raisins is 0.25 x 20 = 5 kgs> and calculates its result 5 correctly. Furthermore, the language description of step 5 has also changed from <The weight of dry grapes in 20 kgs of raisins is 20 - 5 = 15 kgs> to <The weight of dry grapes in 20 kgs of raisins is 20 - 6 = 14 kgs>. Step 5 affects the subsequent step 6 and 7 related to it. Step 6 changes from 0.15x = 15 to 0.15x = 14 and step 7 changes from x = 15 / 0.15 to x = 14 / 0.15. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all steps is still correct, hence transformed solution ends with x = 93.33.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_step": 5,
        "step_explanation": "The step calculates the weight of dry grapes in 20 kgs of raisins as 20 - 6, which is incorrect. It should be 20 - 5 because the water content is 25% of the total weight, not 30%. This leads to an incorrect calculation of the weight of dry grapes and thus an incorrect final result."
