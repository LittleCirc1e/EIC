It should be noted that step 3 in the transformed_solution <3x = 2x + 8 + 7> should be the same as step 3 in the original_solution <3x = 2x + 8 + 7> and calculates its result correctly. Step 4 affects the subsequent steps 5 and 6 related to it. Step 5 incorrectly determines x as 13 (instead of the correct 15), and step 6 incorrectly calculates the third number as 17 (instead of the correct 19). The remaining calculations for steps 5 and 6 are correct based on the erroneous value obtained in step 4. Since only one error needs to be considered, all other steps that reference this result number still reference this number correctly.",

        "step_explanation": "Step 4 first makes a mistake in the algebraic simplification process by not properly isolating the variable x. It误 simplifies to 3x = 2x + 13, which should be 3x - 2x = 15, thus resulting in the incorrect value of x. Subsequent steps use this incorrect value to find the third number, leading to the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 4, so pred_wrong_step is 4."
