        "original_solution": "The number of pairs sold is the total sales divided by the price per pair, so 735 / 9.8 = 75.\n#### 75",

        "original_solution": "Let a be the number of associate professors and b be the number of assistant professors.\n2a + b = 10 because each associate professor brought 2 pencils and each assistant professor brought 1 pencil.\na + 2b = 8 because each associate professor brought 1 chart and each assistant professor brought 2 charts.\nMultiplying the first equation by 2, we get 4a + 2b = 20.\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get 3a = 12.\nSo, a = 4.\nPlugging the value of a into the first equation, we get 2*4 + b = 10.\nSo, b = 2.\nThere are 4 associate professors and 2 assistant professors, so a total of 6 people are present.\n#### 6",

Its subsequent related steps will be affected by the erroneous result of this step but still be calculated correctly. Steps 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 correctly reference the numbers in their calculations, even though they propagate the error introduced in step 1. Please note that we should only consider the error in step 1, so all other steps that reference the numbers of pencils and charts will still reference them correctly except for the modified step. The substeps within step 7 correctly calculate b based on the incorrect step 1. After correcting we would get a=4 and b=2 for a total of 6 people are present. The transformed answer should therefore be returned to the original correct answer, even though the transformation process resulted in a nonsensical result implying a fraction of people.",
