        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, there was a counting error introduced in the calculation of the percentage. The division by the number of days (which was 5 in reality but mistakenly counted as 4) is not relevant for the calculation of the percentage of books not sold. The incorrect transformation changed the calculation from a correct percentage to an incorrect value by dividing the percentage of books not sold by 4, which is unrelated to the number of days books were sold.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_step": 3,
        "step_explanation": "Step 3 first erroneously counts Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday as 4 days instead of 5 days, resulting in an error in the divisor in the formula. And step 3 calculates (340 / 620) * 100 / 4=13.71% instead of (340 / 620) * 100 / 5=8.71%, resulting in the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the miss, is step 3, so pred_wrong_step is 3"
