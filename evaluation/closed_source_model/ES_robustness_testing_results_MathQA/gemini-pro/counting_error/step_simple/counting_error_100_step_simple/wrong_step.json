        "question": "John had a stock of 1300 books in his bookshop. He sold 75 on Monday, 50 on Tuesday, 64 on Wednesday, 78 on Thursday and 135 on Friday. What percentage of the books were not sold?",
        "original_solution": "The total number of books sold is 75 + 50 + 64 + 78 + 135 = 402 books\nThe number of books not sold is 1300 - 402 = 898 books\nThe percentage of books not sold is (898 / 1300) * 100 = 69%\n#### 69",

This affects the calculation of the total number of books sold, the remainder not sold, and the respective percentage. The change from 135 to 120 has modified the subsequent steps without affecting the unrelated steps, resulting in a transformed answer of approximately 70.231% compared to the original answer of 69%.",
