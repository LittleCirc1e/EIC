        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the area and perimeter of the rectangle. The question requires that the bottom area of the cistern to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than adding the length to width and multiplying by 2, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle, resulting in 8*6=48 square meters in the original_solution becoming 2*(8+6)=2*14=28 square meters in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 6, changing from 48+35=83 square meters to 28+35=63 square meters. Note that the language description of step 4 < The bottom area is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 1 mistakenly uses the formula of rectangular area, while the other calculation processes post the error are affected assuming the wrong value is correct, and the processes prior to the error remain unaffected.",

The question requires finding the perimeter, which is the sum of its sides, not finding the area, which is not relevant given the information about the side ratios and perimeter. The proper formula for finding x based on the perimeter and the side ratios is altered from the sum of the sides equal to the perimeter (x + 2x/3 + x/2 = 104) to the incorrect multiplication of the sides with the assumption that it equals the perimeter (x * 2x/3 * x/2 = 104) in the transformed_solution. As a consequence of this change in step 3, x is incorrectly derived as approximately 8.49 instead of the correct value of 48 in the original_solution.
