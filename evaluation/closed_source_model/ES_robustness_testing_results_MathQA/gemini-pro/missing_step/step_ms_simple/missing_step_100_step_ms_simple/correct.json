In the original_solution, step 1 references the original number of men x, and step 2 references the result of step 1, the equation 20x = 22(x-2). Therefore, after deleting step 1, step 2 should become the first step and no longer reference the original number of men explicitly but rather model the same equation directly. Step 3 references the result 20x from step 2. After deleting step 1, step 3 is adjusted to reference 20(x-2) from the new first step and changes the formula from 20x = 22x - 44 to 20x - 40 = 22x - 44. Similarly, Step 4 is adjusted based on the new step 3, and becomes 44 - 40 = 22x - 20x. The final step is then updated based on step 4 and arrives at the incorrect conclusion of x = 2. It is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 2 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step that contains incorrect referencing due to the removal of the original step 1.",
