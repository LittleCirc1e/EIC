        "explanation": "This example changes the division in step 2 to multiplication, incorrectly changing \"each machine produces 0.4 units per hour\" to \"each machine produces 4*10 = 40 units per hour.\" This error leads to subsequent miscalculations: step 3 changes from 10 x 0.4 = 4 units per hour to an incorrect value of 10 x 40 = 400 units per hour, and step 4 changes from the correct \"it will take 100/4 = 25 hours\" to an incorrect \"it will take 100/400 = 0.25 hours.\" This manipulates the original calculation where the production rate per hour for one machine is determined, thereby affecting the aggregate calculation for 10 machines and the total time to produce 100 units, but all other calculations are done correctly based on the incorrect operator change.",
