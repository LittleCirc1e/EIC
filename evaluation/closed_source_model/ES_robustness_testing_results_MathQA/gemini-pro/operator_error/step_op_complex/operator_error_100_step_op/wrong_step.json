        "original_solution": "Let the original quantity of ghee be x kg.\nAmount of pure ghee = 0.6x\nAmount of vanaspati ghee = 0.4x\nTotal amount of ghee = x\nAfter adding 10 kg of pure ghee, the total amount of ghee becomes (x+10)\n0.4x / (x+10) = 20%\n0.4x = 0.2(x+10)\n0.4x = 0.2x + 2\n0.2x = 2\nx = 10\nThe original quantity of ghee was 10 kg.\n#### 10",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The transformation process has incorrectly changed the division operator in step 6 to multiplication, resulting in an erroneous step '0.4x / (x+10) = 20%' becoming '0.4x * (x+10) = 20%'. This affected the subsequent steps and led to an unsolvable quadratic equation, which is not realistic in the given context. The rest of the steps were incorrectly transformed based on the changed operator leading to a fundamentally different equation. As this involves quantities and distribution that cannot be negative, the quadratic equation does not provide a reasonable solution. Thus, the transformed solution does not lead to a valid answer.",

        "pred_wrong_step": 10,
        "step_explanation": "The operator in step 10 encounters an error. It should use addition instead of subtraction. It miscalculates sqrt(5.6)-2 instead of sqrt(5.6)+2. This affects the final result. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 10, so pred_wrong_step is 10."
