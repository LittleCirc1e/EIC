        "original_solution": "Let the number of each type of coin be x.\nThe value of one rupee, 50 paise, and 25 paise coins is x, 0.5x, and 0.25x, respectively.\nSo, the total value is x + 0.5x + 0.25x = 210.\n1.75x = 210\nx = 120\nThere are 120 coins of each type.\n#### 120",
        "original_answer": 120,
        "transformed_solution": "Let the number of each type of coin be x.\nThe value of one rupee, 50 paise, and 25 paise coins is x, 0.5x, and 0.25x, respectively.\nSo, the total value is x + 0.5x + 0.25x = 210.\n1.75x = 200\nx = 200 / 1.75\nx = 114.29\nThere are 114 coins of each type.\n#### 114",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references 210 as 200 from step 3 and changes 1.75x = 210 to 1.75x = 200. It should be noted that step 3 in the transformed_solution <So, the total value is x + 0.5x + 0.25x = 210.> should be the same as the step 3 in the original_solution <So, the total value is x + 0.5x + 0.25x = 210.> and calculates its result 210 correctly. However, in step 4 of the transformed_solution, the total value of 210 is incorrectly referenced as 200, leading to an incorrect calculation of x in subsequent steps. Step 5 and 6 still perform the calculations correctly as if step 4 was correct. You need only consider one error of referencing so that all other steps that reference this result number still reference it correctly. The transformed_answer should be different from the original_answer, which it is in this case.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_step": 4,
        "step_explanation": "Step 4 first erroneously references the result 200 instead of 114.29 from step 3, resulting in the calculation of 114 instead of 114.29. This affects the final result. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 4, so pred_wrong_step is 4."
