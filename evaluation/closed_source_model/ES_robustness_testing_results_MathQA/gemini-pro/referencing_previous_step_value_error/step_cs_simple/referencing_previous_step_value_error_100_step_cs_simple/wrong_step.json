        "original_solution": "She drove 50 miles in the first hour because 50 x 1 = 50\nShe drove 150 miles in the second part of the trip because (1 + 1/2) x 100 = 150\nShe drove 200 miles in all because 50 + 150 = 200\n#### 200",

It should be noted that step 2 in the transformed_solution <She drove 150 miles in the second part of the trip because (1 + 1/2) x 100 = 150> should be the same as the step 2 in the original_solution <She drove 150 miles in the second part of the trip because (1 + 1/2) x 100 = 150> and calculates its result 150 correctly. Step 3, as the single incorrect step, is affected by the error and changes the total from 200 to 220.
