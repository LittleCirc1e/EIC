It should be noted that step 1 in the transformed_solution <Time = Distance / Speed> should be the same as the step 1 in the original_solution <Time = Distance / Speed>. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so all other calculations or references are assumed to be correct despite this error. The transformed_answer differs from the original_answer as the error changes the final result.",
