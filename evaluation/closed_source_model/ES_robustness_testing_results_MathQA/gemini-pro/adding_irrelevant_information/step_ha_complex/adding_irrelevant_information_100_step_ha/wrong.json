        "transformed_solution": "Worker A can complete 1/8 of the job in 1 hour.\nWorker B can complete 1/6 of the job in 1 hour.\nHowever, due to union regulations, there is a mandatory 15-minute break per hour when working together which accounts for a 1/4 hour loss of work.\nTaking this into account, their combined work rate is 1/8 + 1/6 - 1/4 = 5/24 of the job in 1 hour.\nIt takes them 24/5 hours to complete the job working together.\n#### 24/5",

This also affects the calculation in step 4, changing the answer from 24/7 hours to 24/5 hours to complete the job working together.

        "question": "A number when divided by 6 leaves a remainder 3. When the square of the same number is divided by 6, the remainder is what?",
        "original_solution": "Let the number be x.\nTherefore, x = 6a + 3, where a is the quotient.\nThen x^2 = 36a^2 + 36a + 9 = 6(6a^2 + 6a + 1) + 3, which means when the square of the number is divided by 6, the remainder is 3.\n#### 3",

It correctly sets up the equation x = 6a + 3 - 2 to represent the number x, and then squares both sides of the equation to obtain x^2 = (6a + 1)^2. Expanding the square and simplifying, it finds that when x^2 is divided by 6, the remainder is 1."

Finally, it adds the two probabilities together to get the final answer. All steps are correct and no irrelevant information is added."
