        "explanation": "Step 4 adds the information that a prime number 17 was mistakenly omitted and should be included in the calculation, which is not mentioned in the question statement <Assuming there is an additional prime number 17 that was mistakenly omitted>. This results in the original prime number sum calculation of 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 41 changing to 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 = 58 in step 4 of the transformed_solution. This error affects the final positive difference calculation, changing it from 41 - 14 = 27 to 58 - 14 = 44. This additional prime number is not actually between the first and fourth squares, so this error is an example of adding irrelevant information that affects the final result. The calculation otherwise follows the correct steps.",
