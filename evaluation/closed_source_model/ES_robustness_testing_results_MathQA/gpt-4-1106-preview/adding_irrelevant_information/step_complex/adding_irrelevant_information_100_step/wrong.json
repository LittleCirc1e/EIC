        "original_solution": "First, find the amount after the first discount: 400 - (30/100 * 400) = 400 - 120 = 280\nThen, find the amount after the second discount: 280 - (20/100 * 280) = 280 - 56 = 224\n#### 224",
        "original_answer": 224.0,
        "transformed_solution": "First, find the amount after the first discount: 400 - (30/100 * 400) = 400 - 120 = 280\nThen, find the amount after the second discount: 280 - (20/100 * 280) = 280 - 56 = 224\nBecause there is an additional Rs. 20 packaging fee for the saree, the final sale price is 224 + 20 = 244\n#### 244",

        "wrong_type": "adding_irrelevant_information",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 3 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement by inserting a packaging fee of Rs. 20. The error occurs when transforming the statement 'Then, find the amount after the second discount: 280 - (20/100 * 280) = 280 - 56 = 224' from the original_solution into the transformed_solution, where it states 'Because there is an additional Rs. 20 packaging fee for the saree, the final sale price is 224 + 20 = 244'. This introduces an additional cost that changes the final answer, despite not being part of the original question. Other calculations in step 1 and 2 are unaffected and are carried out correctly.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_step": "none",
        "step_explanation": "The solution correctly applies two successive discounts to the original price. First, a 30% discount is applied, which is calculated as 30/100 * 400 = 120, and subtracted from the original price to get 400 - 120 = 280. Then, a 20% discount is applied to the new amount, which is calculated as 20/100 * 280 = 56, and subtracted from the discounted price to get 280 - 56 = 224. Finally, the solution correctly adds the Rs. 20 packaging fee to the discounted price to get the final sale price of 224 + 20 = 244. Therefore, the solution is correct."
