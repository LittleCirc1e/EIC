        "original_solution": "The profit made on the article is 25% of 192, which is 0.25 x 192 = 48\nThe selling price is the cost price plus the profit, 192 + 48 = 240\n#### 240",
        "original_answer": 240.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The profit made on the article is 25% of 192, which is 0.25 x 192 = 48\nBecause the item needed packaging that cost an additional $16, the selling price is the cost price plus the profit and packaging cost, (192 + 48) + 16 = 256\n#### 256",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 2 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <Because the item needed packaging that cost an additional $16>, resulting in step 2 changing from 192 + 48 = 240 in the original_solution to (192 + 48) + 16 = 256 in the transformed_solution. The language description has also changed from <the selling price is the cost price plus the profit> to <the selling price is the cost price plus the profit and packaging cost>. The additional packaging cost is included in the calculation and this affects the final result, as the transformed_answer is different from the original_answer.",

        "step_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the profit as 25% of the cost price, adds it to the cost price, and includes the additional packaging cost to find the final selling price."

        "explanation": "Step 3 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement by inserting a packaging fee of Rs. 20. The error occurs when transforming the statement 'Then, find the amount after the second discount: 280 - (20/100 * 280) = 280 - 56 = 224' from the original_solution into the transformed_solution, where it states 'Because there is an additional Rs. 20 packaging fee for the saree, the final sale price is 224 + 20 = 244'. This introduces an additional cost that changes the final answer, despite not being part of the original question. Other calculations in step 1 and 2 are unaffected and are carried out correctly.",
