        "question": "Gary’s gas station serves an average of 13 cars per hour on Saturdays, 10 cars per hour on Sundays, and 9 cars per hour on all other days of the week. If the station is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, how many cars does Gary’s station serve over the course of a typical week?",
        "original_solution": "The station is open for 16 hours on Saturday and Sunday, and 16 * 5 = 80 hours on all other days\nOn Saturday, the station serves 13 * 16 = 208 cars\nOn Sunday, the station serves 10 * 16 = 160 cars\nOn all other days, the station serves 9 * 80 = 720 cars\nThe total number of cars served in a typical week is 208 + 160 + 720 = 1088 cars\n#### 1088",
        "original_answer": 1088,
        "transformed_solution": "The station is open for 16 hours on Saturday and 16 hours on Sunday, and 16 * 6 = 96 hours on all other days\nOn Saturday, the station serves 13 * 16 = 208 cars\nOn Sunday, the station serves 10 * 16 = 160 cars\nOn all other days, the station serves 9 * 96 = 864 cars\nThe total number of cars served in a typical week is 208 + 160 + 864 = 1232 cars\n#### 1232",

        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 mistakenly counts the number of hours the station is open from Monday to Friday as 16 * 6 = 96 hours instead of 16 * 5 = 80 hours. This counting error also affects step 3, changing the calculation from 9 * 80 = 720 cars to 9 * 96 = 864 cars, and affects step 4, changing the total from 1088 cars to 1232 cars. The other calculation processes are still correct.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_step": "none",
        "step_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the number of cars served each day by multiplying the number of cars served per hour by the number of hours the station is open. Then it correctly sums the cars served each day to find the total number of cars served in a week."

        "question": "John had a stock of 1400 books in his bookshop. He sold 75 on Monday, 50 on Tuesday, 64 on Wednesday, 78 on Thursday, and 135 on Friday. What percentage of the books were not sold?",
        "original_solution": "Total books sold from Monday to Friday is 75 + 50 + 64 + 78 + 135 = 402 books\nThe remaining books after these sales is 1400 - 402 = 998 books\nThe percentage of the books not sold is (998 / 1400) * 100 = 71.2857%\nThe percentage of the books not sold is approximately 71.29%\n#### 71.29",

        "explanation": "Here, the final step inaccurately rounds the percentage from 71.2857% to 71% instead of the correct 71.29% as per the original solution. This causes the transformed answer to be different from the original answer, creating a rounding error at step 4. It's important to note that the counting in earlier steps is unchanged, with only the final rounding step being affected.",
        "is_correct": "yes",

        "explanation": "The error is introduced at step 1 by changing the count of Sundays from 5 to 4, resulting in the miscalculation of the total number of visitors on Sundays from 510 * 5 = 2550 to 510 * 4 = 2040. This error consequently affects the calculation of the total number of visitors on other days, which is erroneously adjusted from 240 * 25 = 6000 to 240 * 26 = 6240, as well as the final total number of visitors in the month and the average number. The wrong step affects only related subsequent steps, specifically steps 2, 3, and 4, without altering the preceding parts of the original solution.

        "step_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the total number of visitors on Sundays and other days separately, then adds them together to find the total number of visitors in the month. Finally, it divides this total by the number of days in the month to find the average number of visitors per day, which is correct."

        "explanation": "In the transformed_solution, the counting result has been erroneously altered by excluding the number 57, which should have been included as it is less than 60 and leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4.

This affects the following steps since the total rainfall is now incorrectly set to 18 cm instead of 21 cm.
