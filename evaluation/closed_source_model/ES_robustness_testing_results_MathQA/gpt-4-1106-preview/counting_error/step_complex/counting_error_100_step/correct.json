        "step_explanation": "Step 1 first makes a mistake by not listing all the positive integers less than 60 that have a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. The list should include 57 as well, which is less than 60 and leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. Therefore, the count of numbers should be 15 instead of 14.

        "question": "Gary’s gas station serves an average of 16 cars per hour on Saturdays, 10 cars per hour on Sundays, and 9 cars per hour on all other days of the week. If the station is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, how many cars does Gary’s station serve over the course of a typical week?",
        "original_solution": "On Saturdays, the station is open for 16 hours, so it serves 16 * 16 = 256 cars\nOn Sundays, the station is open for 16 hours, so it serves 16 * 10 = 160 cars\nFrom Monday to Friday, the station is open for (16 * 5) = 80 hours, so it serves 80 * 9 = 720 cars\nThe total number of cars served over the course of a typical week is 256 + 160 + 720 = 1136 cars\n#### 1136",
        "original_answer": 1136,
        "transformed_solution": "On Saturdays, the station is open for 16 hours, so it serves 16 * 16 = 256 cars\nOn Sundays, the station is open for 16 hours, so it serves 16 * 10 = 160 cars\nFrom Monday to Friday, the station is open for (15 * 5) = 75 hours, so it serves 75 * 9 = 675 cars\nThe total number of cars served over the course of a typical week is 256 + 160 + 675 = 1091 cars\n#### 1091",

The final step summing up the total number of cars served during the week is then affected, with the original 256 + 160 + 720 changing to 256 + 160 + 675, resulting in a different total of 1091 cars.
