        "question": "How to resolve this question: second saturday and every sunday is a holiday. How many working days will be there in a month of 30 days beginning on a Saturday?",
        "original_solution": "In a month of 30 days, there will be 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays\nThe second Saturday and every Sunday are holidays, so there will be 2 Saturdays and 4 Sundays off\nTherefore, the total number of working days will be 30 - 2(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 24 days\n#### 24",
        "original_answer": 24,
        "transformed_solution": "In a month of 30 days, there will be 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays\nThe second Saturday and every Sunday are holidays, so there will be 3 Saturdays and 4 Sundays off\nTherefore, the total number of working days will be 30 - 3(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 23 days\n#### 23",

        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 incorrectly increases the number of Saturdays off from 2 to 3. The wrong step caused an overcounting error in the number of holidays (Saturdays off), and it further impacts the calculation in step 3, changing it from 30 - 2(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 24 to 30 - 3(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 23. This is the step where the counting error is made, and the other steps remain correctly calculated based on the progression of the transformed_solution, leading to a transformed_answer of 23 days which differs from the original_answer.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "pred_wrong_step": 1,
        "step_explanation": "The first step is incorrect because in a month of 30 days beginning on a Saturday, there will be 5 Saturdays, not 4. This is because the 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th days will all be Saturdays."

        "question": "Sheila works 8 hours per day on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and 6 hours per day on Tuesday and Thursday. She does not work on Saturday and Sunday. She earns $ 396 per week. How much does she earn in dollars per hour?",
        "original_solution": "The total hours worked from Monday through Friday is 8 + 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 36 hours\nThe total number of days from Monday through Friday is 5 days\nThe average number of hours Sheila works per day is 36 / 5 = 7.2 hours\nShe earns $396 per week\nSo, she earns $396 / 36 hours = $11 per hour\n#### 11",

        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 erroneously counts the number of workdays as 4 instead of 5, excluding one of the 8-hour workdays. This alteration changes the total hours worked in the week from 36 to 28, leading to an incorrect calculation of the hourly wage in the later step, which changes from $396 / 36 hours = $11 per hour to $396 / 28 hours = $14.14 per hour. It should be noted that only the first step contains a counting error, and subsequent calculations are based on this mistake; however, these calculations are performed correctly based on the altered inputs.",
