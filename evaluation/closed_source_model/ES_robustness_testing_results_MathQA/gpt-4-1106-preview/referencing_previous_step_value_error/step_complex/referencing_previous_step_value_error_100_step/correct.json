The number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of pairs of 2 and 5 factors, and since there are always more 2s than 5s, we only count the number of 5s. In the case of 10!, there are two factors of 5 (from 5 and 10), which results in two trailing zeros, not five as in the transformed_solution.
