The correct formula for the surface area of a rectangular solid with dimensions l, w, h is 2lw + 2lh + 2wh. In this case, the dimensions are 2s (length), s (width), and s (height), so the correct surface area should be 2(2s)(s) + 2(2s)(s) + 2(s)(s) = 4s^2 + 4s^2 + 2s^2 = 10s^2. The ratio e should be calculated using the surface area of the cube, which is 6s^2, not the volume. Therefore, the correct ratio e is 6s^2 / 10s^2 = 3/5.

Note that the language description of step 4 < The bottom area is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct.

        "step_explanation": "The first wrong step is step 5. Step 5 confuses the perimeter and area formulas. The bottom perimeter calculation is incorrect for determining the wet surface area. The bottom area should be calculated using the area formula for a rectangle, which is length multiplied by width, not the perimeter formula. The correct calculation for the bottom area is 8m * 6m = 48 square meters. The wall area calculation is also incorrect; it should be the sum of the areas of the four walls that are in contact with the water. The correct calculation for the wall area is 2*(8m*1.25m) + 2*(6m*1.25m) = 2*10m^2 + 2*7.5m^2 = 20m^2 + 15m^2 = 35m^2. The total wet surface area should be the sum of the bottom area and the wall area, which is 48m^2 + 35m^2 = 83m^2. Therefore, the first step to make a mistake is step 5, and the pred_wrong_step is 5."
