        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the area and perimeter of rectangle. The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width, and the perimeter be twice the sum of the length and width. The change in the transformed_solution is the swap of the formulas for area and perimeter, resulting in 'Area = L * W = 300' becoming 'Perimeter = L + L + W + W = 300' and 'Perimeter = 2L + 2W = 70' becoming 'Area = 2L + 2W', with the rest of the steps incorrectly based on this swapped premise. This results in an incorrect transformed_answer of 50 meters for the width, instead of the correct answer of 15 meters. Note that only one formula error is introduced, affecting all subsequent related steps. The language description in the transformed_solution remains unchanged, consistent with the directive to only modify the relevant formulae and not the wordings.",

The question requires that the area of the triangle to be solved be equal to 0.5 multiplied by the base multiplied by the height, rather than summing up the lengths of the three sides and dividing by 2, which is equivalent to the semi-perimeter of the triangle.

The subsequent step that references the result of step 5 leads to the final incorrect answer.

The original solution correctly uses the area formula which includes trigonometric functions. The transformed solution incorrectly attempts to find a 'perimeter' by naively adding the two given sides with an assumed third side, which is improperly taken as half of one of the sides assuming a right triangle, which is not given in the problem. This confuses the concept of area with perimeter and also brings in an unrelated concept of a right triangle within an obtuse triangle. Note that the language description of step 1 < First, use the formula to find the area > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution.

The formula for the area of a triangle given two sides and the included angle is (1/2)*ab*sin(C), not the perimeter formula P = a + b + c. The step incorrectly calculates the perimeter instead of the area and assumes a right triangle construction which is not applicable for an obtuse triangle. This mistake affects the subsequent calculation of the perimeter, leading to an incorrect final result."
