In the original_solution, the correct step was 2lb=49-25=24, and lb was correctly calculated based on subtracting l^2+b^2 from (l+b)^2. In the transformed_solution, the step was incorrectly modified to l^2+b^2=49-24=25 to cause a calculation error in the subsequent step of finding lb. This modified step did not account for the right calculation of l^2+b^2 and instead treated it as if l^2+b^2 had to be equal to (l+b)^2-2lb, which is not a correct mathematical operation in the context. As a result, this affects the final calculation of the area, which is now incorrectly calculated as l*b=25.
