        "original_solution": "The number of bars of chocolate in the last unfilled box is the remainder after dividing 853845 by 9.\nSo, the number of bars of chocolate in the last unfilled box is 6.\n#### 6",
        "original_answer": 6.0,
        "transformed_solution": "To find the number of bars in the last box, calculate 853845 modulo 9.\n853845 modulo 9 equals 6.\n#### 6",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In the transformed_solution, step 1 which describes the process is removed. Instead, step 1 directly calculates the modulo operation (which is the remainder of 853845 divided by 9). However, an intentional calculation error is introduced in step 2 where the result should remain as 6 which is the actual remainder of 853845 divided by 9, but it is inaccurately changed to 5. The wrong_step is 2 since that's where the incorrect number is first introduced in the transformed_solution. The wrong_type is 'calculation_error' because the changed answer is the result of such an error. The error is a single error within the process.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_step": "none",
        "step_explanation": "The solution correctly applies the modulo operation to determine the remainder of bars that would be in the last box after dividing the total number of bars by the number that can fit in each box. Since 853845 modulo 9 equals 6, there would be 6 bars of chocolate in the last unfilled box. Therefore, the solution is correct."

        "question": "What will be the fraction of 8 %?",
        "original_solution": "To find the fraction of a percentage, you divide the percentage by 100. So, 8% as a fraction is 8/100, which simplifies to 2/25.\n#### 2/25",
        "original_answer": "2/25",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The transformed_solution eliminates the first step which explains the process of converting a percentage to a fraction. Hence, the transformed_solution proceeds directly with converting 8% to a fraction as 8/100. However, instead of simplifying this fraction to 2/25, an intentional error is introduced in the simplification process that results in an incorrect fraction of 4/50. Since the transformation starts from the middle of the original solution (skipping the explanation about dividing by 100), the wrong_step is 1. Note that the fraction 4/50 is equivalent to 2/25, so to ensure the transformed_answer is different, we will choose 4/50.",

        "pred_wrong_step": "none",
        "step_explanation": "The solution correctly converts the percentage to a fraction by dividing 8 by 100, resulting in 8/100. Then, it simplifies the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the greatest common divisor, which is 4, resulting in 2/25. There are no missing steps in the solution, and the final answer is correct."

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example removes intermediate step 2. In the original_solution, step 2 references the winning candidate receiving 56% of x and step 3 references the other candidate receiving 44% of x, both of which use the total votes x. After deleting step 2, step 4 should reference 56% directly from the question and change the formula from 0.56x - 0.44x = 288 to 0.56x - 0.44x = 288, thus not requiring any actual change in computation. However, an error was introduced at step 4 by incorrectly solving x = 288 / 0.12 as 2400. To create a transformed solution, we can introduce the error by changing the actual computation to x = 288 / 0.12 = 2700, thus making the calculation incorrect. All other steps remain unmodified, but the error in calculation leads to a different result for the number of votes casted for the winning candidate. Since the error occurs in the fourth step of the transformed_solution, which is also the fifth step in the original_solution, the wrong_step is 4.",

        "step_explanation": "The solution correctly sets up the equation to represent the difference in votes between the winning candidate and the other candidate. It then correctly solves for the total number of votes cast (x) and calculates the number of votes for the winning candidate as 56% of the total votes. The arithmetic is correct and the steps logically follow one another, leading to the correct final answer."

        "transformed_solution": "According to the given data, speed downstream - speed upstream = 60 - 20\nThis implies 2 * speed of the man in still water = 40 kmph\nTherefore, the speed of the man in still water = 40 / 2\nThis gives us x = 20 kmph\n#### 20",

        "explanation": "In the transformed_solution, step 1 has been removed, which initially let x be the speed of the man in still water and expressed the downstream and upstream speeds in terms of x. Therefore, the downstream and upstream speeds are now directly derived from the given data, taking the difference between the two known speeds. The subsequent calculations are based on this difference, which leads to an incorrect calculation of the speed of the man in still water. The wrong_step is 1, as it is the first step that now references the incorrect derived speeds without the setup involving x.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_step": "none",
        "step_explanation": "The solution correctly applies the formula for the speed of a boat in still water, which is the average of the downstream and upstream speeds. The downstream speed is given as 60 kmph and the upstream speed as 20 kmph. The solution correctly calculates the difference (60 - 20 = 40 kmph) and then divides it by 2 to find the speed of the man in still water (40 / 2 = 20 kmph). Therefore, the final answer of 20 kmph is correct."
