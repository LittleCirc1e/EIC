        "explanation": "Here, step 1 has been removed, which calculates the total parts of the ratio. Consequently, step 2 should reference the result from the question, which is 50 doughnuts equivalent to 5 parts. The reference to each part being equivalent to 10 still holds as the calculation method is correct, but since we consider there to be 10 parts of muffins instead of 1, step 2 should be modified to reflect a 1:1 part ratio between doughnuts and muffins. Given there are 50 doughnuts, the calculation changes to 50 x 1 = 50 for the number of muffins, which should ultimately modify the formula to 50 x 1 = 50. It should be noted that the calculation in step 3 maintains the error and refers incorrectly to '10 parts of muffins', as the initial step that created the incorrect carryover effect from the deletion is step 1, thus it is marked as the wrong_step. The transformed_solution erroneously states that there are 100 muffins due to incorrectly maintaining the original step 4 calculation without adjusting for the altered quantity suggested by the deleted step 1 (10 parts was used instead of the correct 1 part, leading to multiplying by 10 instead of 1).",

The correct calculation should be simply taking the value of one part (which is 10) as the number of muffins. Therefore, there are 10 muffins in the shop, not 100. The error in step 3 leads to the final wrong result of 100 muffins instead of the correct answer of 10 muffins."

        "original_solution": "Let the income be x.\nHe spends 30% of x on petrol, so the expenditure on petrol is 0.3x.\nTherefore, the remaining income is 0.7x.\nHe spends 30% of the remaining income on house rent, so the expenditure on house rent is 0.3 * 0.7x\nHe spends the balance on food, which is 0.7x - 0.3 * 0.7x = 0.7x - 0.21x = 0.49x\nWe are given that he spends Rs. 300 on petrol, so 0.3x = 300\nSolving for x, we get x = 1000\nTherefore, the expenditure on house rent is 0.3 * 0.7 * 1000 = 210\n#### 210",

In the original_solution, step 3 references the result of step 2, and steps 4 and 5 reference the result of step 3. Therefore, after deleting step 2, step 3 should reference the Rs. 300 spent on petrol from the question and change the calculated method for the remaining income to the inverse of petrol's percentage, which is 300 / 0.3 = 1000. Step 4 and 5, as subsequent related steps, are affected by the modification in step 3. In the transformed_solution, step 4 (previously step 5 in original_solution) now calculates the incorrect house rent expenditure by directly using the total income (1000) instead of the remaining income after spending on petrol, and step 5 calculates the balance on food. The first wrong step referencing an incorrect number in the transformed_solution is step 3, as it should reference the remaining income after petrol, not the full income.",

The correct calculation should be to find the total income by dividing the expenditure on petrol by the percentage spent on petrol, which is 300 / 0.3. However, the step should be to calculate the remaining income after spending on petrol, which is the total income minus the expenditure on petrol. This step is missing, and if added, the reasoning would become correct. The correct remaining income should be calculated as total income - expenditure on petrol. This error affects the calculation of the expenditure on house rent in step 3 and the balance spent on food in step 4."

In the transformed_solution, step 2 which originally added 50 miles from step 1 to 150 miles from what was step 2 in the original_solution must now be corrected to add 0 to 150 miles, since step 1 has been removed. This results in a total distance driven of 150 miles, as stated in the transformed_solution. The deletion of step 1 removes the reference to the number of miles driven in the first hour from the solution, which leads to an incorrect calculation of the total distance driven and a wrong transformed_answer of 150 miles, which is different from the original_answer of 200 miles.

The calculation assumes that the second part of the trip, at 100 miles per hour, takes 1.5 hours (1 hour late plus 30 minutes early), and therefore she drives 150 miles in the second part. However, this step is missing the necessary reasoning to determine the actual time she would need to drive at 100 miles per hour to make up for the 1-hour delay and still arrive 30 minutes early. The distance for the second part of the trip cannot be determined without knowing the total time she was supposed to take to reach the airport as per her original schedule. The solution also fails to account for the distance she drove in the first hour at 50 miles per hour. The correct approach would involve setting up an equation to solve for the total distance based on the speeds and times given. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 1, so pred_wrong_step is 1."

Therefore, subsequent steps need to start with the simplified form 2(x-390) and solve for x accordingly. Step 3 now directly equates 2(x-390) with 2x + 780, instead of 2x - 780 = 2x + 780. As a result, the subtraction operation in step 4 is incorrect, but it still reveals that the equation 2x - 780 = 2x + 780 cannot hold true unless the extra bananas (780) is balanced out by an equal amount on the other side of the equation (-780 = 780). Hence, in step 5, instead of equating -780 to 390, it should equate -780 to 780 to maintain this balance. Step 6 then incorrectly solves for x by dividing 780 by 2, which yields the incorrect answer of x = 390.

The correct equation should account for the extra bananas per child, which is 2, multiplied by the number of absent children, which is 390. The correct equation should be 2x - 780 = 2x + 780, which simplifies to -780 = 780, which is not possible. The error in step 3 leads to the subsequent incorrect steps and the final wrong result.
