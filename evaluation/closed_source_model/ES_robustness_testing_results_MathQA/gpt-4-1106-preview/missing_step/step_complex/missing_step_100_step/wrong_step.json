        "explanation": "Here, step 1 has been removed, which calculates the total parts of the ratio. Consequently, step 2 should reference the result from the question, which is 50 doughnuts equivalent to 5 parts. The reference to each part being equivalent to 10 still holds as the calculation method is correct, but since we consider there to be 10 parts of muffins instead of 1, step 2 should be modified to reflect a 1:1 part ratio between doughnuts and muffins. Given there are 50 doughnuts, the calculation changes to 50 x 1 = 50 for the number of muffins, which should ultimately modify the formula to 50 x 1 = 50. It should be noted that the calculation in step 3 maintains the error and refers incorrectly to '10 parts of muffins', as the initial step that created the incorrect carryover effect from the deletion is step 1, thus it is marked as the wrong_step. The transformed_solution erroneously states that there are 100 muffins due to incorrectly maintaining the original step 4 calculation without adjusting for the altered quantity suggested by the deleted step 1 (10 parts was used instead of the correct 1 part, leading to multiplying by 10 instead of 1).",

The correct calculation should be 1 part of muffins times the value of each part (10), which equals 10 muffins, not 100. The subsequent final answer is incorrect because it is based on the result of step 3. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 3, so pred_wrong_step is 3."

The last steps calculate the individual numbers based on this newly solved x, however, the calculation for 4x = 24 has been omitted. The transformed solution no longer includes the number 24, reflecting the product of 4x, hence the transformed answer is [18, 42] which is different from the original answer.
