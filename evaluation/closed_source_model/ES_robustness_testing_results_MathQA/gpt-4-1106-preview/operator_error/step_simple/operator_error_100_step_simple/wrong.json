        "explanation": "This example turns the addition in step 1 into subtraction, and by changing + to -, 0.5 - 0.5x + 0.2x = 0.4 becomes 0.5 - 0.5x - 0.2x = 0.4. This affects the subsequent related step 2. Step 2 now becomes incorrect because the term 0.2x should have been subtracted from -0.5x, but instead, it was mistakenly left as addition in the transformed solution. Therefore, the new equation after the incorrect transformation should have been 0.5 - 0.7x = 0.4, leading to -0.7x = -0.1 and x = -0.1/-0.7, which is approximately 0.14286. Hence, the explanation should reflect that an addition was incorrectly transformed into a subtraction in step 1, but the transformed solution did not correctly calculate the resultant change.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_step": "none",
        "step_explanation": "The equation set up to represent the mixture of paints is correct. The initial intensity of the paint is 50% (0.5), and the intensity of the paint being added is 20% (0.2). The desired final intensity is 40% (0.4). The equation 0.5 - 0.5x + 0.2x = 0.4 correctly represents the situation where x is the fraction of the original paint replaced. Solving this equation gives 0.3x = 0.1, and x = 0.33333, which is the correct fraction of the original paint that was replaced to achieve the new intensity."
