        "question": "how many zeros does 10 ! end with ?",
        "original_solution": "The number of zeros at the end of 10! is determined by the number of times 10 can be factored out of the factorial. There are two 5s in the prime factorization of 10, so there will be two trailing zeros.\n#### 2",
        "original_answer": 2.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The number of zeros at the end of 10! is determined by the number of times 10 can be factored out of the factorial. There are three 5s in the prime factorization of 10!, so there will be three trailing zeros.\n#### 3",

        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The transformation process involved changing the number \"two\" to \"three\" in the original solution text, which is incorrect because there are actually only two 5s in the prime factorization of 10!. As a result of changing the factor count, an incorrect number of trailing zeros was presented – three instead of two. This is a single calculation error (miscount of factors), and the transformed answer is consequently different from the original answer.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_step": "none",
        "step_explanation": "The solution correctly identifies that the number of trailing zeros in 10! is determined by the number of times 10 can be factored out of the factorial, which is based on the number of 5s since there are more than enough 2s to pair with them. Although the explanation does not detail that 10 contributes two factors of 5, the final count of three trailing zeros is correct."

        "original_solution": "The profit per item is $15 - $10 = $5\nThe manufacturer needs to earn $150,000 + $130,000 = $280,000 in total revenue\nThe number of items to sell is $280,000 / $5 = 56,000\n#### 56000",

        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, a calculation error in step 2 changes the total revenue needed from $280,000 to $260,000, impacting the correct calculation of the number of items to sell in step 3 ($260,000 / $5). The error is introduced in step 2 and it affects the subsequent related step without altering previous steps or unrelated calculations.

        "step_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the profit per item by subtracting the variable cost from the selling price. It then correctly adds the desired profit to the fixed costs to find the total revenue needed. Finally, it divides the total revenue by the profit per item to find the correct number of items needed to be sold to achieve the desired profit. Therefore, the solution is correct."

This error directly impacts the last step where Ford's age is calculated, changing Ford's correct age from 16 (based on C = 18) to 18 (based on the incorrect C = 20). The previous steps are unaffected by this error and thus remain the same as the original solution. It should be noted that step 8 has been updated to reflect the incorrect result from step 7 (18 - 2 = 18 rather than 16), ensuring the transformed solution is self-consistent while the calculation error still stands.",
