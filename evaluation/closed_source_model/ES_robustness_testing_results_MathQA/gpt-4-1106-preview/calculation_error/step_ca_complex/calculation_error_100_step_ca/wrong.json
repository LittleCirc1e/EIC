This error directly impacts the last step where Ford's age is calculated, changing Ford's correct age from 16 (based on C = 18) to 18 (based on the incorrect C = 20). The previous steps are unaffected by this error and thus remain the same as the original solution. It should be noted that step 8 has been updated to reflect the incorrect result from step 7 (18 - 2 = 18 rather than 16), ensuring the transformed solution is self-consistent while the calculation error still stands.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_step": "none",
        "step_explanation": "All the calculations in the solution are correct. The equation formed to represent the sum of their ages is correct, and the subsequent steps to solve for Christopher's age (C) are correctly executed. Finally, Ford's age is correctly calculated by subtracting 2 from Christopher's age."
