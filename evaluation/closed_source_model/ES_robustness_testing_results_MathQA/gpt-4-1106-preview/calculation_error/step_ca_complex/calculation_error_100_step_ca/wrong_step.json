        "explanation": "In this case, the error has been introduced at the final step of the calculation. The correct evaluation of |-6| should be 6, but in the transformed solution, it has been evaluated incorrectly as 4. This leads to the final transformed expression being 79 - 4 = 75 instead of the correct 79 - 6 = 73. All other steps are performed correctly, and only the final calculation has been altered, changing the final answer and introducing a single error.",
