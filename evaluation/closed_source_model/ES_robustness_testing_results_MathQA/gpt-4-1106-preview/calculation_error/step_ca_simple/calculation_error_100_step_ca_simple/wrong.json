Subsequent steps are affected since they use the result of this wrong step. Step 3 remains unchanged because it does not depend on the result from step 2. Step 4, however, uses the wrong result 1.8y instead of 2y, so the equation 2(0.75x) is replaced with 1.8(0.75x), resulting in 1.35x instead of the correct 1.5x. This leads to the final incorrect statement that z is 135% of x instead of 150%.
