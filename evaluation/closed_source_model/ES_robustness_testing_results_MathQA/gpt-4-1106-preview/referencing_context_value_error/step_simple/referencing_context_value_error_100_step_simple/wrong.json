        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 5 incorrectly references b = 9 instead of b = 7. It incorrectly substitutes this value into the equation, affecting the calculation of c = -10 instead of c = -8. The subsequent related steps of this erroneous step will only inherit its erroneous result and be calculated correctly. The transformed equation f(x) = x^2 + 9x - 10 has the y-coordinate crossing at -10 instead of -8.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "pred_wrong_step": "none",
        "step_explanation": "The solution correctly finds the values of b and c by solving the system of equations given by f(1) = 0 and f(-8) = 0. The value of b is correctly determined to be 9, and the value of c is correctly determined to be -10. The function f(x) crosses the y-axis at the point where x = 0, which is given by the constant term c in the quadratic equation. Since c = -10, the y-coordinate where f(x) crosses the y-axis is indeed -10. Therefore, the solution is correct."
