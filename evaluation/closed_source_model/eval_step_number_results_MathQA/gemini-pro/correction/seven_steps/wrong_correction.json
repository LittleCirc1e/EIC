        "question": "On Independence Day, bananas were to be equally distributed among the children in a school so that each child would get two bananas. On that particular day, 390 children were absent, and as a result, each child got two extra bananas. Find the actual number of children in the school.",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the actual number of children in the school.\nTotal bananas distributed = 2(x-390) = 2x - 780\nTotal bananas received = 2x\n2x - 780 = 2x + 780\n-780 = 390\nx = 390 + 390\nx = 780\n#### 780",
        "original_answer": 780.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the actual number of children in the school.\nTotal bananas distributed = 2(x-390) = 2x - 780\nTotal bananas received = 2x\n2x - 780 = 2x + 780\n-780 = 780\nx = 780 + 390\nx = 1170\n#### 1170",
        "transformed_answer": 1170.0,
        "wrong_step": 5,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates -780 as 780 in step 5, which affects the subsequent step 6. The error in step 5 modifies the equation -780 = 390 to -780 = 780. Consequently, step 6 is also affected, changing the calculation from x = 390 + 390 to x = 780 + 390, resulting in an incorrect final answer of x = 1170 instead of the correct x = 780. The previous steps remain unchanged as they are not affected by the error in step 5.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Let x be the actual number of children in the school.\nTotal 食 distributed = 2(x-390) = 2x - 780\nTotal 食 received = 2x + 780\n2x - 780 = 2x + 780\n-1560 = 1560\nx = 1560 + 390\nx = 1950\n#### 1950",
        "corrected_answer": 1950,
        "corrected_explanation": "The total number of 食 distributed is 2(x-390) = 2x - 780, and the total number of 食 received is 2x + 780. Since each child got two extra 食, we can set up the equation 2x - 780 = 2x + 780 and solve for x to find the actual number of children in the school."
