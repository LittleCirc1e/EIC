        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example mistakenly changes the result of the equation 3m = 12 to 3m = 13 in step 5, which affects the final step of solving for m. The correct calculation should result in m = 4, but due to the introduced error, the transformed solution incorrectly calculates m as 4.33. The previous steps remain unaffected by this error, as they correctly establish the equivalence of the exponents for the powers of 2. The error is isolated to the step where the equation 3m = 12 is incorrectly transformed to 3m = 13, leading to the incorrect final answer.",

        "corrected_answer": 4,
        "corrected_explanation": "The mistake in the original solution is that it incorrectly simplifies 2^(2m) to 4^m. The correct simplification is 2^(2m) = (2^2)^m = 4^m. After this correction, the rest of the solution is correct, and the final answer should be 4."
