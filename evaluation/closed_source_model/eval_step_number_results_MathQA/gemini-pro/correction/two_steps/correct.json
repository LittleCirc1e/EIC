        "original_solution": "The lowest possible number of students is the least common multiple of 10 and 24 because it must be divisible by both 10 and 24.\nThe least common multiple of 10 and 24 is 120 because 10 x 12 = 120 and 24 x 5 = 120.\n#### 120",

        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates 24 x 5 as 100 instead of 24 x 5 = 120 in step 2. The subsequent steps do not exist, so only step 2 is affected. The error is introduced in the calculation of the least common multiple, which should be the product of the largest multiple of 10 that 24 can divide into, which is 120. The error changes the final answer to 100, which is incorrect, as the least common multiple of 10 and 24 is indeed 120.",

        "explanation": "The original solution correctly states that each bee makes 1 gram of honey in 40 days. However, in the transformed solution, the second step incorrectly multiplies 40 by 2 instead of 1, resulting in an erroneous conclusion that 1 bee will make 1 gram of honey in 80 days. The first step remains unchanged as it is not related to the error introduced in the second step.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The question asks how many days it takes for 1 honey bee to make 1 gram of honey. Since each bee makes 1 gram of honey in 40 days, it will take 1 bee 40 days to make 1 gram of honey."
