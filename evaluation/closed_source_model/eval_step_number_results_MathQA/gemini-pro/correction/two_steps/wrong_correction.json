        "original_solution": "It takes 8 minutes for 8 monkeys to eat 8 bananas because they eat 1 banana per monkey per minute.\nIt would take 8 minutes for 3 monkeys to eat 3 bananas because the rate of eating remains the same.\n#### 8",
        "original_answer": 8.0,
        "transformed_solution": "It takes 8 minutes for 8 monkeys to eat 8 bananas because they eat 1 banana per monkey per minute.\nIt would take 6 minutes for 3 monkeys to eat 3 bananas because the rate of eating remains the same.\n#### 6",

        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The transformed_solution incorrectly states that it would take 6 minutes for 3 monkeys to eat 3 bananas, which is a calculation error in step 2. The rate of eating remains the same, so it should still be 8 minutes as in the original solution. This is the only error introduced, and the rest of the solution remains unchanged.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "It takes 8 minutes for 8 monkeys to eat 8 bananas because they eat 1 banana per monkey per minute.\nTo find out how many minutes it would take 3 monkeys to eat 3 bananas, we can set up a proportion:\n8 monkeys / 8 minutes = 3 monkeys / x minutes\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n8 monkeys * x minutes = 8 minutes * 3 monkeys\nSolving for x, we get:\nx minutes = (8 minutes * 3 monkeys) / 8 monkeys\nx minutes = 3 minutes\nTherefore, it would take 3 monkeys 3 minutes to eat 3 bananas.",
        "corrected_answer": 3,
        "corrected_explanation": "The corrected solution sets up a proportion to find the number of minutes it would take 3 monkeys to eat 3 bananas. The proportion is based on the fact that the rate of eating remains the same, which is 1 banana per monkey per minute. By cross-multiplying and solving for x, we find that it would take 3 monkeys 3 minutes to eat 3 bananas."
