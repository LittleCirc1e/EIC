        "explanation": "In this example, the calculation of (x/y) in step 7 is incorrectly changed from 2/5 to 4/5. This is the only step that has been modified, and it is a calculation error. The previous steps remain unaffected because they are correct and not related to the error introduced in step 7. The transformed answer is different from the original answer as required.",
