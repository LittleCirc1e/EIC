        "question": "sarah is driving to the airport . after driving at 50 miles per hour for one hour , she realizes that if she continues at that same average rate she will be an hour late for her flight . she then travels 100 miles per hour for the rest of the trip , and arrives 30 minutes before her flight departs . how many miles did she drive in all ?",
        "original_solution": "She drove 50 miles in the first hour because 50 x 1 = 50\nShe drove 150 miles in the second part of the trip because (1 + 1/2) x 100 = 150\nShe drove 200 miles in all because 50 + 150 = 200\n#### 200",
        "original_answer": 200.0,
        "transformed_solution": "She drove 50 miles in the first hour because 50 x 1 = 50\nShe drove 150 miles in the second part of the trip because (1 + 1/2) x 100 = 150\nShe drove 200 miles in all because 50 + 150 = 250\n#### 250",
        "transformed_answer": 250.0,
        "wrong_step": 3,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates the total distance as 50 + 150 = 250 instead of 50 + 150 = 200 in step 3. The error is introduced in the final addition step, which does not affect the previous calculations of 50 miles in the first hour and 150 miles in the second part of the trip. The calculation error is only present in the final step, making it a single error.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "She drove 50 miles in the first hour because 50 x 1 = 50.\nShe drove 100 miles in the second part of the trip because (1 + 1/2) x 100 = 100.\nShe drove 150 miles in all because 50 + 100 = 150.",
        "corrected_answer": 150,
        "corrected_explanation": "The problem states that Sarah arrives 30 minutes before her flight departs, which is half an hour. So the total time she spent on the trip is 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1 hour and 30 minutes = 1.5 hours. The total distance she drove is the sum of the distances she drove in the first hour and the second part of the trip, which is 50 + 100 = 150 miles."
