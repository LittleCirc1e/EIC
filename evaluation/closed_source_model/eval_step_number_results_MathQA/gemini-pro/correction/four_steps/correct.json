        "explanation": "In this example, the greatest common divisor (GCD) is incorrectly stated as 5 in the transformed solution instead of the correct GCD which is 7. The error occurs in step 4 where the conclusion is drawn. The previous steps that list the prime factorization of each number are correct and remain unchanged. The error in the final step does not affect the correctness of the prime factorizations but leads to an incorrect final answer.",

        "corrected_solution": "105 = 3 x 5 x 7\n1001 = 7 x 11 x 13\n2436 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 7 x 29\nThe greatest common divisor of 105, 1001 and 2436 is 7.\n#### 7",
        "corrected_answer": 7,
        "corrected_explanation": "The greatest common divisor (GCD) of three numbers is the largest positive integer that divides all three numbers without leaving a remainder. To find the GCD of 105, 1001, and 2436, we can first factorize each number into its prime factors:\n105 = 3 x 5 x 7\n1001 = 7 x 11 x 13\n2436 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 7 x 29\nThe GCD of these three numbers is the product of the common prime factors, which is 7. Therefore, the greatest number that exactly divides 105, 1001, and 2436 is 7."
