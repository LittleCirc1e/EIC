        "question": "for any positive number x , the function [ x ] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x . for example , [ 1 ] = 1 , [ 1.367 ] = 1 and [ 1.899 ] = 1 . if k is a positive integer such that k ^ 2 is divisible by 45 and 80 , what is the units digit of k ^ 3 / 4000 ?",
        "original_solution": "The greatest integer less than or equal to k^2/45 and k^2/80 is k^2/45 = k^2/80.\nTherefore, k^2 is divisible by 3600 because 45*80 = 3600.\nSo, k is divisible by 60 because the square root of 3600 is 60.\nTherefore, the units digit of k^3/4000 is 0 because k^3/4000 = (60n)^3/4000 = 216000n^3/4000 = 54n^3, where n is an integer.\n#### 0",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this example, the calculation of (60n)^3/4000 is incorrectly simplified to 53n^3 instead of 54n^3 in step 4. This error changes the units digit of the final answer from 0 to 3. The previous steps remain unaffected because they are correct and do not depend on the erroneous step. The error is introduced only in the final step, which is the calculation of the units digit of k^3/4000.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Since k^2 is divisible by 45 and 80, k^2 is divisible by their least common multiple, which is 3600. Therefore, k is divisible by 60, since the square root of 3600 is 60. So, k can be expressed as 60n, where n is an integer. Then, k^3/4000 = (60n)^3/4000 = 216000n^3/4000 = 54n^3. Therefore, the units digit of k^3/4000 is 4.",
        "corrected_answer": 4,
        "corrected_explanation": "The corrected solution first finds the least common multiple of 45 and 80, which is 3600. Then, it determines that k is divisible by 60, since the square root of 3600 is 60. Next, it expresses k as 60n, where n is an integer. Finally, it simplifies k^3/4000 to 54n^3 and concludes that the units digit of k^3/4000 is 4."
