        "original_solution": "The lowest possible number of students is the least common multiple of 10 and 24 because it must be divisible by both 10 and 24.\nThe least common multiple of 10 and 24 is 120 because 10 x 12 = 120 and 24 x 5 = 120.\n#### 120",

The error is introduced in the calculation of the least common multiple, which should be the product of the largest multiple of 10 that 24 can divide into, which is 120. The error changes the final answer to 100, which is incorrect, as the least common multiple of 10 and 24 is indeed 120.",
