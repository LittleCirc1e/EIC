        "explanation": "In this example, the greatest common divisor (GCD) is incorrectly stated as 5 in the transformed solution instead of the correct GCD which is 7. The error occurs in step 4 where the conclusion is drawn. The previous steps that list the prime factorization of each number are correct and remain unchanged. The error in the final step does not affect the correctness of the prime factorizations but leads to an incorrect final answer.",
