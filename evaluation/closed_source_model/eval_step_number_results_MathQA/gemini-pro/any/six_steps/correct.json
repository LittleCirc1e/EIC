        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this example, the calculation error is introduced in step 4 where the correct subtraction 292 - 12 = 280 is mistakenly calculated as 292 - 12 = 290. This error affects the value of x, which is incorrectly calculated as 72.5 instead of 70. Consequently, the largest number, which is x+6, is incorrectly calculated as 78.5 instead of 76. The steps before the error remain unchanged, and the steps after the error inherit the wrong result from step 4, but the calculations within each step are still performed correctly.",
