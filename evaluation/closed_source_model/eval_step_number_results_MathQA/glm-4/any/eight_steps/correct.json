        "explanation": "In this example, the division in step 4 is incorrectly rounded down to 248 instead of correctly calculating 4969 / 20 = 248.45. Since the light cannot glow a fractional number of times, the maximum number of times it can glow is 248 full glows. However, to introduce an error, we round down to the next whole number, which is 247, thus creating a single calculation error. The previous steps remain unaffected as they are correct and unrelated to the error introduced in step 4.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "any_explanation": "The calculation of the number of times the light glows is incorrect. The light should glow one more time because the time difference is exactly divisible by 20, which would result in 248 times, not 247."
