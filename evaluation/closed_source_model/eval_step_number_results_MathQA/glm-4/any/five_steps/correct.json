        "explanation": "In this example, the calculation in step 4 is intentionally altered from 5 x 5 x 5 = 125 to 5 x 5 x 5 = 150. This is the only step that has been changed, and it is a calculation error. The previous steps remain unaffected because they simply state the number of options for each place value, which is correct. The transformed solution has a single error in the final calculation, which leads to a different transformed answer from the original answer.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "any_explanation": "The explanation correctly identifies that there are 5 odd digits, but the calculation is incorrect. For a 3-digit number, the hundreds place cannot be 0, so it should have 5 options as stated. However, the tens and ones places can both be any of the 5 odd digits including 0, so they each have 5 options. The correct calculation should be 5 options for hundreds, 5 options for tens, and 5 options for ones, which is 5 x 5 x 5 = 125, not 150."
