Multiplying both sides by 84 gives us 10x = 840. Dividing both sides by 10 gives us x = 84. However, this is the distance for one direction. Since we need the round trip distance, we divide 840 by 2 to get the distance up the river, which is 420 miles.

        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates (150-21)/3 + 1 as 43 instead of 44 in step 3, which affects the final step of calculating the number of integers divisible by 3 but not by 7. The subsequent step 7 inherits the error from step 3, modifying 44 - 7 = 37 to 43 - 7 = 36. The previous steps 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 remain unchanged as they are not affected by the error introduced in step 3.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "The first number divisible by 3 after 20 is 21. The last number divisible by 3 before 150 is 147. Calculate the number of integers divisible by 3 between 21 and 147: (147-21)/3 + 1 = 45. The first number divisible by 21 after 20 is 21. The last number divisible by 21 before 150 is 147. Calculate the number of integers divisible by 21 between 21 and 147: (147-21)/21 + 1 = 7. Calculate the number of integers divisible by 3 but not by 7: 45 - 7 = 38.",
        "corrected_answer": "38.0",
        "corrected_explanation": "The original solution incorrectly included 150 as divisible by 3. Since 150 is not divisible by 3, the correct range should be from 21 to 147. The number of integers divisible by 3 in that range is 45, not 43. Subtracting the number of integers divisible by both 3 and 7 (which is 7, correctly calculated), we get the correct number of integers divisible by 3 but not by 7, which is 38."
