The total bananas distributed after the absences would be 4 times the number of children present, which is 4(x - 390). This total must still equal the initial total number of bananas, so we have:\n2x = 4(x - 390)\n2x = 4x - 1560\n1560 = 4x - 2x\n1560 = 2x\nx = 1560 / 2\nx = 780",

The correct approach is to realize that the total number of bananas did not change due to the absences; only the number of bananas per child increased. The correct equation involves comparing the initial total number of bananas (2x) to the new distribution after the absences (4 times the number of children present, or 4(x - 390)). Solving this equation correctly gives us the actual number of children in the school, which is 780."
