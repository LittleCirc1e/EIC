        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this example, the division in step 4 is incorrectly rounded down to 248 instead of correctly calculating 4969 / 20 = 248.45. Since the light cannot glow a fractional number of times, the maximum number of times it can glow is 248 full glows. However, to introduce an error, we round down to the next whole number, which is 247, thus creating a single calculation error. The previous steps remain unaffected as they are correct and unrelated to the error introduced in step 4.",

        "corrected_solution": "Convert the given times into seconds: \n1:57:58 = 1*3600 + 57*60 + 58 = 7078 seconds\n3:20:47 = 3*3600 + 20*60 + 47 = 12047 seconds\nCalculate the time difference: \n12047 - 7078 = 4969 seconds\nDivide the time difference by 20 to find the maximum number of times the light glows, but since the light glows every 20 seconds, we need to include the first glow at or after the start time, so we add 1 to the result: \n(4969 / 20) + 1 = 248.45. Since we can't have a fraction of a glow, we round down to the nearest whole number for the maximum times it could glow without exceeding the time frame.\nHowever, we made a mistake in the original calculation; the light actually glows one more time than the number of intervals because it glows on the first second of the period as well.\nSo the corrected calculation is: \n(4969 / 20) + 1 = 248 + 1 = 249",
        "corrected_answer": "249",
        "corrected_explanation": "The light glows a maximum of 249 times between 1:57:58 and 3:20:47 am because we need to account for the first glow at or after the start time and the fact that the light glows every 20 seconds includes the first second of the period."
