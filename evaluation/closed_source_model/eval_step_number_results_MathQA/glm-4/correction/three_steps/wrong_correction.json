        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The error was introduced in step 3 by incorrectly stating that the 83rd digit to the right of the decimal point of 89/99 is 9 instead of 8. The period of the decimal representation of 89/99 is indeed 02, which means the sequence of digits repeats every 2 digits. Since 83 is an odd number, the 83rd digit would be the first digit in the repeating sequence, which is 8. However, the transformed solution incorrectly states that the 83rd digit is 9. This is the only error introduced, and it does not affect the previous steps.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "To find the 83rd digit to the right of the decimal point in the fraction 89/99, we need to first find the repeating pattern of the decimal. The remainder when 89 is divided by 99 is not 89, it is actually 89 modulo 99, which is 89. The repeating pattern of the decimal is found by looking at the fraction in its reduced form, which is 89/99. The decimal representation of 89/99 is 0.898898... (with the block 898 repeating). To find the 83rd digit, we consider that the block of 898 repeats every 3 digits. So, we divide 83 by 3 (because the block length is 3) to find out how many complete blocks we have: 83 / 3 = 27 with a remainder of 2. This means the 83rd digit is the second digit of the repeating block, which is 9.",
        "corrected_answer": "9",
        "corrected_explanation": "The repeating pattern of the decimal is 898, which repeats every 3 digits. The 83rd digit corresponds to the second digit of the 27th complete repetition of this pattern, which is 9."
