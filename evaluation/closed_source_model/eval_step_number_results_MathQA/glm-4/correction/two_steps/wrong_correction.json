        "original_solution": "First, we need to find the total number of meters he needs to examine to reject 2. This can be found by dividing 2 by 0.04% (or 0.0004) and then multiplying by 100 to convert from decimal to percentage.\nTotal number of meters to examine = 2 / 0.0004 * 100 = 5000\n#### 5000",

        "explanation": "The transformed_solution contains a calculation error in the first step, where the result of dividing 2 by 0.0004 and then multiplying by 100 is incorrectly stated as 4000 instead of the correct 5000.

        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "To find the total number of meters the inspector needs to examine to reject 2, we need to set up a proportion. If 0.04% of meters are rejected, this means 0.04 meters are rejected per 100 meters examined. To find out how many meters need to be examined to reject 2, we can set up the following proportion: \n\n0.04 meters / 100 meters = 2 meters / X meters \n\nSolving for X, we get:\n\nX = (2 meters * 100 meters) / 0.04 meters",
        "corrected_answer": "50000.0",
        "corrected_explanation": "The corrected calculation involves setting up a proportion to find the number of meters that need to be examined to reject 2. The proportion is set up so that the ratio of rejected meters to examined meters is the same as the desired number of rejected meters to the unknown number of meters to be examined. Solving this proportion gives us the corrected answer of 50,000 meters that need to be examined."
