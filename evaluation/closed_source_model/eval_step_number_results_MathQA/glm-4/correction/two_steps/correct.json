        "original_solution": "Jar y is 1/2 full, so it is 1/2 * (1/2) = 1/4 full of the capacity of jar x.\nAfter pouring the water from jar y into jar x, jar x will be 1/3 + 1/4 = 7/12 full of its capacity.\n#### 7/12",

        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates the sum of 1/3 and 1/4 as 6/12 instead of the correct 7/12 in step 2.

        "corrected_solution": "Jar y is 1/2 full of its own capacity and it has half the capacity of jar x, so it is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 of the capacity of jar x full of water. When the water from jar y is poured into jar x, jar x will be 1/3 + 1/4 = 7/12 full of its capacity.",
        "corrected_answer": "7/12",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly calculated the fraction of jar x's capacity that would be filled by the water from jar y. Jar y is 1/2 of the capacity of jar x, not 1/4. Therefore, when adding the fractions, we get 1/3 + 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/3 + 1/4 = 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12."
