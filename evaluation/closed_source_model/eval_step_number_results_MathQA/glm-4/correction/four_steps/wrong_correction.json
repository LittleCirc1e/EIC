Since k^2 is divisible by both 45 and 80, it must also be divisible by their LCM, which is 3600. The square root of 3600 is 60, so k must be a multiple of 60. Let k = 60n, where n is a positive integer. Now, we need to find the units digit of k^3 / 4000. Substituting k with 60n, we get (60n)^3 / 4000. Simplifying, we have (216000n^3) / 4000 = 54n^3. The units digit of this expression depends on the value of n^3, which can be 1, 8, or 27 for n = 1, 2, or 3, respectively.

Since there are 10 children, and each child picks the sum of the numbers of the baskets, the total number of apples picked in all rounds is 55 x 10 = 550. However, this is not the correct approach to find out how many rounds of picking there are. We need to find out how many times the sum 55 can be subtracted from 1000 without making any basket empty. The number of rounds is 1000 / 55, which is approximately 18.1818 (we cannot have a fraction of a round). So, the children can pick apples for 18 rounds. The total apples picked in 18 rounds is 18 x 55 = 990. The apples left are 1000 - 990 = 10.",
