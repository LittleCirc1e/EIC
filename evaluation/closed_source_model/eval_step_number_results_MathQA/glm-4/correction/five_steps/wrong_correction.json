        "is_correct": "no",
        "corrected_solution": "Let r be the original radius. The area of the circle is A = πr^2. After the decrease, the new radius is 0.7r because it is decreased by 30%. The new area is A' = π(0.7r)^2 = 0.49πr^2. The area is decreased by (A - A')/A = (πr^2 - 0.49πr^2)/(πr^2) = 0.51 or 51%.",
        "corrected_answer": 0.51,
        "corrected_explanation": "The area of a circle is proportional to the square of its radius. When the radius is decreased by 30%, the area is decreased by the square of the decrease factor, which is (0.7)^2 = 0.49. The area has decreased to 0.49 of its original size, which means it has decreased by 1 - 0.49 = 0.51 or 51%."

To find out how many seconds after the gears start to rotate will gear r have made exactly 6 more revolutions than gear l, we need to calculate the time it takes for gear r to make 6 revolutions more than gear l. Since gear r makes 2 revolutions for every revolution of gear l, it will take 6/2 = 3 revolutions of gear l for gear r to be 6 revolutions ahead.
