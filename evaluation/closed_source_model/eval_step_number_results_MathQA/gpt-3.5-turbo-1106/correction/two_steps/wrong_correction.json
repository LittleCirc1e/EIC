        "original_solution": "The distribution within one standard deviation represents 68% of the population, so half of that, which is 34%, lies to the left of the mean.\nTherefore, the percent j of the distribution that is less than m + d is 50% (half) + 34% = 84%.\n#### 84%",

The error is introduced in the second step, and the subsequent step is affected by this error. The previous step remains unchanged as it is not related to the error introduced.
