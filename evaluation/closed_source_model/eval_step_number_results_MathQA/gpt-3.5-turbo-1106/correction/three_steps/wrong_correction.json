        "explanation": "The error was introduced in step 3 by incorrectly stating that the 83rd digit to the right of the decimal point of 89/99 is 9 instead of 8. The period of the decimal representation of 89/99 is indeed 02, which means the sequence of digits repeats every 2 digits. Since 83 is an odd number, the 83rd digit would be the first digit in the repeating sequence, which is 8. However, the transformed solution incorrectly states that the 83rd digit is 9. This is the only error introduced, and it does not affect the previous steps.",

Step 3 inherits the error from step 2, modifying the formula 22 + 21 = 43 to 21 + 20 = 41. It should be noted that you only need to pay attention to one calculation error, and the subsequent related steps to this wrong step will only inherit its error, which means the relevant numbers in the formula or language description inherit the error, but the calculation of the formula itself is still correct.",
