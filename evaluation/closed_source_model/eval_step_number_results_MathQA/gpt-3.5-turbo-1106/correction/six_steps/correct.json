        "original_solution": "Let the number be x.\nThen the equation is x - 30 = (1/4)x\nMultiplying through by 4 to clear the fraction gives 4x - 120 = x\nSubtracting x from both sides gives 3x - 120 = 0\nAdding 120 to both sides gives 3x = 120\nDividing both sides by 3 gives x = 40\n#### 40",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this example, the last step of the original solution, which is dividing both sides by 3 to get x = 40, is modified to produce an incorrect result of x = 45. This is the only step that has been changed, and it is a calculation error. The previous steps remain unaffected by this change, and the transformed answer is different from the original answer as required.",
