        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates the total profit as $100 instead of $98 in step 5, which affects the final step 6. The calculation of 47.6 + 50.4 should result in 98, but it is incorrectly stated as 100. The subsequent step 6 then inherits this error, modifying the calculation of the total profit percentage from 98 / 280 = .35 to 100 / 280 = .357. The previous steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 remain unchanged as they are not affected by the error introduced in step 5.",
