        "explanation": "In this example, the calculation in step 7 is intentionally altered from 250 / -0.02 = -12500 to 250 / -0.02 = -12000, which is incorrect. This error only affects the final step, which is the calculation of the total worth of the stock. The previous steps remain unchanged as they are not dependent on the result of step 7. The transformed solution thus contains a single calculation error in step 7, leading to a different transformed answer from the original answer.",
