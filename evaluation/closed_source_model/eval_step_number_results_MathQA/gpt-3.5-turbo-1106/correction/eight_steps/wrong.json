        "original_solution": "Let x be the age of the younger person.\nThe age of the elder person is x + 16.\n6 years ago, the elder person was (x + 16) - 6 and the younger person was x - 6.\n(x + 16) - 6 = 3(x - 6)\nx + 10 = 3x - 18\n28 = 2x\nx = 14\nThe present age of the elder person is 14 + 16 = 30\n#### 30",

        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this example, the calculation error is introduced in step 6 where the correct division of 28 by 2 should result in x = 14. However, the transformed solution incorrectly states x = 13. This error affects the final step, which calculates the present age of the elder person. The original correct calculation of 14 + 16 = 30 is changed to 13 + 16 = 29 in the transformed solution. The previous steps remain unaffected as they do not depend on the result of step 6. The transformed answer is different from the original answer as required.",
