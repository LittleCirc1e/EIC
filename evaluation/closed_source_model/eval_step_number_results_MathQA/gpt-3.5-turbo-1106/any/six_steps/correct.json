        "question": "the sum of 3 consecutive multiples of 3 is 72. what is the largest number?",
        "original_solution": "Let the three consecutive multiples of 3 be 3x, 3(x+1), and 3(x+2).\nTheir sum is 3x + 3(x+1) + 3(x+2) = 72\nSimplify the equation to get 9x + 6 = 72\nSubtract 6 from both sides to get 9x = 66\nDivide by 9 to find x = 7\nThe largest number is 3(x+2) = 3(7+2) = 3(9) = 27\n#### 27",
        "original_answer": 27.0,

        "wrong_step": 5,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this example, the division in step 5 is incorrectly calculated as x = 8 instead of x = 7. This error affects the final step, which calculates the largest number based on the value of x. The subsequent step 6 inherits the error from step 5, changing the calculation from 3(7+2) = 27 to 3(8+2) = 30. The previous steps remain unchanged as they are not affected by the error introduced in step 5.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "any_explanation": "The largest number should be 3(x+2) = 3(8+2) = 3(10) = 30, not 30."
