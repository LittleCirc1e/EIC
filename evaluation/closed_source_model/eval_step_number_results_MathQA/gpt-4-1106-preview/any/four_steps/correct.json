        "original_solution": "1 man can reap 40 / 4 = 10 acres of land in 15 days.\n1 man can reap 10 / 15 = 2/3 acres of land in 1 day.\n16 men can reap 16 x 2/3 = 32/3 acres of land in 1 day.\n16 men can reap 32/3 x 30 = 320 acres of land in 30 days.\n#### 320",

        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates 32/3 x 30 as 288 acres instead of 320 acres in step 4. The error in step 4 does not affect the previous steps 1, 2, and 3, which remain correct. The subsequent step 4 is the only step affected by the error, where the multiplication of 32/3 by 30 should result in 320 acres, but the error changes it to 288 acres.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "any_explanation": "The calculation of the number of acres 16 men can reap in 1 day is incorrect. It should be 16 men * (2/3 acres per man per day) = 32/3 * 16, not 32/3."
