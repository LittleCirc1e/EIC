        "explanation": "The error is introduced in step 4 where the correct subtraction of 150 from 300 should result in L = 150, but it is mistakenly calculated as L = 160. This error does not affect the previous steps but changes the final answer. The subsequent step, which is the final answer, inherits this error, resulting in a transformed answer of 160 instead of the correct 150.",
        "is_correct": "no",
        "any_explanation": "The final step of the solution contains a mathematical error. After simplifying the equation L + 150 = 300, the correct step should be to subtract 150 from 300 to find L, which would result in L = 150, not L = 160."
