        "question": "bhanu spends 30 % of his income on petrol on scooter 20 % of the remaining on house rent and the balance on food . if he spends rs . 300 on petrol then what is the expenditure on house rent ?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the total income.\nHe spends 0.3x on petrol because 30% of x is 0.3x\nHe has 0.7x remaining because 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\nHe spends 0.2 * 0.7x = 0.14x on house rent because 20% of 0.7x is 0.14x\nHe spends 0.86x on food because 0.7x - 0.14x = 0.86x\nHe spends 0.3x = 300 on petrol, so x = 300 / 0.3 = 1000\nHe spends 0.14 * 1000 = 140 on house rent\n#### 140",
        "original_answer": 140.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the total income.\nHe spends 0.3x on petrol because 30% of x is 0.3x\nHe has 0.7x remaining because 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\nHe spends 0.2 * 0.7x = 0.14x on house rent because 20% of 0.7x is 0.14x\nHe spends 0.86x on food because 0.7x - 0.14x = 0.86x\nHe spends 0.3x = 300 on petrol, so x = 300 / 0.3 = 1000\nHe spends 0.14 * 1000 = 150 on house rent\n#### 150",

        "wrong_step": 6,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates 0.14 * 1000 as 150 instead of 0.14 * 1000 = 140 in step 6. The error in step 6 does not affect the previous steps, as they are independent calculations. The steps before the wrong step remain correct, and only the final step, which is the calculation of the house rent, is affected by the error.",
        "is_correct": "yes",
        "any_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the total income by dividing the petrol expenditure by the percentage spent on petrol. It then correctly calculates the expenditure on house rent by taking 20% of the remaining income after petrol expenses."
