        "explanation": "The error was introduced in step 7 where the division 132 / 0.17 was incorrectly calculated as 800 instead of the correct 776.47. This error then affected the final calculation of x in step 8, where x is calculated based on the incorrect value of y. The correct calculation should have been 2000 - 776.47 = 1223.53, but due to the error, it was calculated as 2000 - 800 = 1200. The steps before the error remain unchanged, and only the steps after and including the erroneous step are affected.",

        "corrected_answer": 1223.53,
        "corrected_explanation": "The error in the original solution was in the step where 0.09y and 0.08y were combined. The correct combination is 0.09y + 0.08y = 0.17y, not 0.09y + 0.08y = 0.09y + 0.08y. After correcting this, we divide 132 by 0.17 to find y, and then subtract y from 2000 to find x."
