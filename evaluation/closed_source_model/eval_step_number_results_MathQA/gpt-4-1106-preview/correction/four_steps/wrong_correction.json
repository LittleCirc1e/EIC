        "original_solution": "The total weight of a, b, and c is 45 x 3 = 135 kg.\nThe total weight of a and b is 40 x 2 = 80 kg.\nThe total weight of b and c is 47 x 2 = 94 kg.\nThe weight of b is 80 + 94 - 135 = 39 kg.\n#### 39",
        "original_answer": 39.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total weight of a, b, and c is 45 x 3 = 135 kg.\nThe total weight of a and b is 40 x 2 = 80 kg.\nThe total weight of b and c is 47 x 2 = 94 kg.\nThe weight of b is 80 + 94 - 135 = 41 kg.\n#### 41",

        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates the final weight of b as 80 + 94 - 135 = 41 kg instead of the correct calculation 80 + 94 - 135 = 39 kg in step 4. The error in step 4 does not affect the previous steps 1, 2, and 3, which remain unchanged. The subsequent step 4 is the only step affected by the error, and it is the step where the single calculation error is introduced, resulting in a transformed answer of 41 kg instead of the original answer of 39 kg.",

        "corrected_solution": "The total weight of a, b, and c is 45 x 3 = 135 kg.\nThe total weight of a and b is 40 x 2 = 80 kg.\nThe total weight of b and c is 47 x 2 = 94 kg.\nTo find the weight of b, we can set up the equation: b = (94 + 80 - 135) / 2.\nSolving for b gives us: b = (174 - 135) / 2 = 39 / 2 = 19.5 kg.",
        "corrected_answer": 19.5,
        "corrected_explanation": "The weight of b is calculated by adding the total weight of a and b and the total weight of b and c, then subtracting the total weight of a, b, and c, and finally dividing by 2, because b is counted twice in the sum of (a+b) and (b+c)."
