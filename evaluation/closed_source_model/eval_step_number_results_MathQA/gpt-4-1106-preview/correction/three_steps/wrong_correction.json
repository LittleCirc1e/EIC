        "original_solution": "She drove 50 miles in the first hour because 50 x 1 = 50\nShe drove 150 miles in the second part of the trip because (1 + 1/2) x 100 = 150\nShe drove 200 miles in all because 50 + 150 = 200\n#### 200",

        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates the total distance as 50 + 150 = 250 instead of 50 + 150 = 200 in step 3. The error is introduced in the final addition step, which does not affect the previous calculations of 50 miles in the first hour and 150 miles in the second part of the trip. The calculation error is only present in the final step, making it a single error.",

        "corrected_solution": "She drove 50 miles in the first hour because 50 x 1 = 50\nShe needs to save 1.5 hours of travel time by doubling her speed to 100 mph\nThe time saved per hour at the new speed is 50 miles (100 mph - 50 mph)\nTo save 1.5 hours, she needs to drive 1.5 hours x 50 miles/hour = 75 miles at 100 mph\nShe drove 125 miles in total because 50 + 75 = 125\n",
        "corrected_answer": "125.00",
        "corrected_explanation": "Sarah drove 50 miles in the first hour at 50 mph. To arrive 30 minutes early after being 1 hour late, she needs to make up for 1.5 hours of travel time. By doubling her speed to 100 mph, she saves 50 miles of travel per hour (100 mph - 50 mph). To save 1.5 hours, she needs to drive for 1.5 hours at the new speed, which is 1.5 x 50 = 75 miles. The total distance is 50 miles + 75 miles = 125 miles."

        "corrected_answer": "1:2",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly simplified the ratio of the curved surfaces. The correct ratio is obtained by dividing the curved surface area of the first cylinder by that of the second cylinder.
