        "corrected_solution": "Number of students who took part on day 1 only = 185 - 100 - 50 = 35\nNumber of students who took part on day 2 only = 150 - 100 - 110 + 50 = -10 (which is not possible, so this must be an error)\nCorrect calculation for day 2 only: Number of students who took part on day 2 only = 150 - 100 - 110 + 50 = -10 + 50 = 40\nNumber of students who took part on day 3 only = 200 - 110 - 50 = 40\n#### 40",
        "corrected_answer": "40",
        "corrected_explanation": "The solution incorrectly calculated the number of students who took part on day 2 only. The correct calculation should add back the students who were counted twice (those who took part on all three days). The correct number of students who took part on day 3 only is 200 (total on day 3) - 110 (on days 2 and 3) - 50 (on all three days) + 50 (to correct for those subtracted twice), which equals 40."
