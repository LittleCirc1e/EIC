        "original_solution": "The distance traveled by ferry p is 3 x 8 = 24 kilometers.\nThe speed of ferry q is 8 + 4 = 12 kilometers per hour.\nThe distance traveled by ferry q is 24 x 2 = 48 kilometers.\nThe time taken by ferry q is 48 / 12 = 4 hours.\nThe time difference is 4 - 3 = 1 hour longer for ferry q compared to ferry p.\n#### 1",

        "explanation": "In this example, the calculation of 48 / 12 in step 4 is incorrectly given as 3 hours instead of the correct 4 hours. This error affects the final step, which calculates the time difference based on the incorrect time taken by ferry q. The previous steps remain unchanged because they are not dependent on the erroneous step 4. The final step is modified from 4 - 3 = 1 hour to 3 - 3 = 0 hours, reflecting the inherited error from step 4.",

        "corrected_answer": 9.0,
        "corrected_explanation": "The speed of ferry q should be 4 kilometers per hour slower than ferry p, not faster. Therefore, the speed of ferry q is 8 - 4 = 4 kilometers per hour. The rest of the calculation follows from this corrected speed."

The principal should be calculated by subtracting the third year's interest from the total amount after 2 years. Then, the annual interest rate is calculated by dividing the interest of the third year by the principal and converting it to a percentage."
