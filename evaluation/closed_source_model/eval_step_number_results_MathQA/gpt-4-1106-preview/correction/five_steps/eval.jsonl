However, the total number of favorable outcomes should be the product of the number of ways to select 2 women and the number of ways to select 2 girls, which is 3 * 3 = 9, not 8. Therefore, the probability is 9/15, which simplifies to 3/5 or 0.60."}
{"question": "If the perimeter of a rectangular garden is 600 m, its length when its breadth is 150 m is?", "original_solution": "Let the length of the garden be L and the breadth be B.\nPerimeter = 2(L + B) = 600\nSubstitute B = 150 into the equation: 2(L + 150) = 600\nSimplify the equation: L + 150 = 300\nSubtract 150 from both sides: L = 150\n#### 150", "original_answer": 150.0, "transformed_solution": "Let the length of the garden be L and the breadth be B.\nPerimeter = 2(L + B) = 600\nSubstitute B = 150 into the equation: 2(L + 150) = 600\nSimplify the equation: L + 150 = 300\nSubtract 150 from both sides: L = 160\n#### 160", "transformed_answer": 160.0, "wrong_step": 4, "wrong_type": "calculation_error", "is_single_error": true, "explanation": "The error is introduced in step 4 where the correct subtraction of 150 from 300 should result in L = 150, but it is mistakenly calculated as L = 160.

{"question": "Victor gets 90% marks in examinations. If these are 405 marks, find the maximum marks.", "original_solution": "Let the maximum marks be x.\nThen, 90% of x = 405\n0.90x = 405\nx = 405 / 0.90\nx = 450\n#### 450", "original_answer": 450.0, "transformed_solution": "Let the maximum marks be x.\nThen, 90% of x = 405\n0.90x = 405\nx = 405 / 0.90\nx = 500\n#### 500", "transformed_answer": 500.0, "wrong_step": 4, "wrong_type": "calculation_error", "is_single_error": true, "explanation": "The error is introduced in step 4 where the division 405 / 0.90 is incorrectly calculated as 500 instead of 450.

The previous steps remain unchanged as they are not affected by the error in step 4.", "is_correct": "yes", "corrected_solution": "none", "corrected_answer": "none", "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly applies the percentage formula to find the maximum marks. Since Victor gets 90% of the maximum marks and that equals 405, the solution sets up the equation 0.90x = 405, where x represents the maximum marks. Solving for x gives x = 405 / 0.90, which correctly simplifies to x = 500. Therefore, the maximum marks are indeed 500, and the solution is correct."}
