        "corrected_answer": 120,
        "corrected_explanation": "The population increases by 1 person every 30 seconds, which means in one minute (60 seconds), the population increases by 2 persons. Therefore, in an hour (60 minutes), the population would increase by 2 persons/minute * 60 minutes = 120 persons."
