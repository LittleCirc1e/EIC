        "corrected_explanation": "The solution correctly calculates the percentage increase in the area of the square. The original area is x^2, and after the side is increased by 15%, the new side becomes 1.15x. Squaring this gives a new area of 1.3225x^2. The increase in area is then 0.3225x^2, which is a 32.25% increase when compared to the original area (not 30.25% as stated in the solution). However, since the question asks for the percentage increase, the final answer should be 32.25%, not 30.25%. Therefore, there is a mistake in the final reported percentage."
