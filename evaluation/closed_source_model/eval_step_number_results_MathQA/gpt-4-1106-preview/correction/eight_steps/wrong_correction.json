        "explanation": "In this example, the calculation error is introduced in step 6 where the division of 44 by 2 is incorrectly calculated as 24 instead of 22. This error affects the final answer, which is the age of Abe after 7 years. The correct calculation should be 44 / 2 = 22, but the transformed solution incorrectly states x = 24. Consequently, the final step of adding 7 years to the incorrect present age of 24 results in an incorrect future age of 31 instead of the correct age of 29.",

        "corrected_explanation": "The equation formed from the question is 2x - 7 = 37. Solving for x gives x = 22, not 24. Therefore, the present age of Abe is 22, and his age after 7 years will be 29."
