        "explanation": "Here, step 1 has been removed. In the original_solution, step 1 assigns a variable x to the number we are looking for. Step 2 constructs an equation based on the question. After deleting step 1, step 2 should change the equation to directly equate to 0, because without defining the variable x or giving it a proper equation, the solution should simplify the equation directly to zero for solving. This leads to a change in Step 2 from '15x + 196 = x' to '15x + 196 = 0'. Subsequent steps are then adjusted to solve the new equation, and step 3 changes from 'Subtract x from both sides: 14x + 196 = 0' to 'Subtract 196 from both sides: 15x = -196'. The following steps solve for x accordingly. The wrong_step is 1 in the transformed_solution, which corresponds to the adjusted step 2 in the original_solution, because it's the first step that references an incorrect equality relationship due to the deletion of the variable assignment to x.",
        "eval_result": "To determine if the [Solution] is correct, we need to check if it satisfies the given condition.\nThe given condition is that the number, when multiplied by 15, is increased by 196.\nAccording to the [Solution], the value of x is -13.066666666666666.\nWe can substitute this value into the equation and check if it satisfies the condition:\n15 * (-13.066666666666666) + 196 = 0\n-206.999999999999996 + 196 = 0\n-10 = 0\nSince the equation is not satisfied, the [Solution] is incorrect.\nTherefore, the correct [Solution] is:\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 1, which must be an integer, and the explanation is 1.The answer is: 1"
