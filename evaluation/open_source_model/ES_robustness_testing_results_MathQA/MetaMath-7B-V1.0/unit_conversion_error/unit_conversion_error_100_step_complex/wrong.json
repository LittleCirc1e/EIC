Let's find the rate at which the first valve fills the pool:\nRate of the first valve: 100x = 100/100x = x cubic meters per minute\nSince both expressions equal r, we can set them equal to each other:\n2x + 50 = x\nx = 50\nNow, let's substitute the value of x back into the equation for the total rate of filling the pool:\n2x + 50 = 2(50) + 50 = 100 + 50 = 150 cubic meters per minute\nSince the pool is filled in 48 minutes, we can calculate the capacity of the pool:\nCapacity of the pool = 150 cubic meters per minute x 48 minutes = 7200 cubic meters\nTherefore, the value of the unknown variable r is 7200. The capacity of the pool is 7200 cubic meters.\n#### 7200\nThe answer is: 7200"

        "original_solution": "After 2 seconds, we have z = 2^2 + 2*2 = 4 + 4 = 8 km/h.\nAfter 7 seconds, we have z = 7^2 + 2*7 = 49 + 14 = 63 km/h.\nTherefore, the subway train is moving 63 - 8 = 55 km/h faster after 7 seconds than it was after 2 seconds.\n#### 55",

        "explanation": "In the second calculation of the original solution that computes the speed of the subway train after 7 seconds, there is an intentional unit conversion error introduced: the formula should remain z = 7^2 + 2*7, but in the transformed solution, it was incorrectly altered to z = 7^2 + 2*5. This change affects only the associated step and keeps the previous calculations regarding the speed after 2 seconds accurate. As a result, the difference in speed incorrectly becomes 59 - 8 = 51 km/h in the transformed solution versus the correct 63 - 8 = 55 km/h in the original solution.",

        "question": "a metal company ' s old machine makes bolts at a constant rate of 100 bolts per hour . the company ' s new machine makes bolts at a constant rate of 150 bolts per hour . if both machines start at the same time and continue making bolts simultaneously , how many minutes will it take the two machines to make a total of 500 bolts ?",
        "original_solution": "The old machine makes 100 bolts per hour and the new machine makes 150 bolts per hour.\nTogether, they make 100 bolts/hour + 150 bolts/hour = 250 bolts per hour.\nTo make a total of 500 bolts, it will take 500 bolts / 250 bolts/hour = 2 hours.\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so it will take 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes for the two machines to make a total of 500 bolts.\n#### 120",

        "explanation": "Here, step 4 makes an incorrect unit conversion, which erroneously suggests there are 50 minutes in an hour instead of 60 minutes, resulting in 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes in the original_solution becoming 2 hours * 50 minutes/hour = 100 minutes in the transformed_solution. This changes the original_answer from 120 minutes to 100 minutes, introducing a unit conversion error. The error is isolated to just this single wrong step, while the other steps' computations remain correct.",

        "question": "A leak in the bottom of a tank can empty the full tank in 6 hours. An inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute. When the tank is full, the inlet is opened and due to the leak, the tank is empty in 12 hours. How many litres does the cistern hold?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the capacity of the tank in litres.\nThe inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute, so in 12 hours it fills 6 * 12 * 60 = 4320 litres.\nThe leak can empty the tank in 6 hours, so in 12 hours it can empty 2x litres.\nNow, 4320 - 2x = x.

And it affects the subsequent related step 4, which changes from 4320 - 2x = x to 3600 - 2x = x and the solution from x = 4320 to x = 3600 / 3 = 1200 litres for the capacity of the tank. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, so the other calculation processes related to the rate of the leak are still correct.",
