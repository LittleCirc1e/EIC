        "original_solution": "Let the income be x.\nHe spends 30% of x on petrol, so the expenditure on petrol is 0.3x.\nTherefore, the remaining income is 0.7x.\nHe spends 30% of the remaining income on house rent, so the expenditure on house rent is 0.3 * 0.7x\nHe spends the balance on food, which is 0.7x - 0.3 * 0.7x = 0.7x - 0.21x = 0.49x\nWe are given that he spends Rs. 300 on petrol, so 0.3x = 300\nSolving for x, we get x = 1000\nTherefore, the expenditure on house rent is 0.3 * 0.7 * 1000 = 210\n#### 210",

        "explanation": "This example turns the multiplication factor for the house rent in step 4 from 0.3 to 0.7, changing the calculation of the expenditure on house rent from 0.3 * 0.7x to 0.7 * 0.7x. The expenditure on petrol remains correct at Rs. 300. Since the amount spent on petrol sets the value of x to 1000, the incorrect multiplication in step 4 results in the transformed expenditure on house rent being 0.7 * 0.7 * 1000 = 490, which differs from the original calculation of 0.3 * 0.7 * 1000 = 210. The substitution of x with its value in the original solution is correct, but using the wrong operator in step 4 changes the result.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 4, and the explanation is that the operator in step 4 encounters an error and should use division instead of subtraction. It miscalculates 0.7x - 0.49x = 0.21x instead of 0.7x / 0.49x = 1.43x, resulting in the final erroneous result. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 4."
