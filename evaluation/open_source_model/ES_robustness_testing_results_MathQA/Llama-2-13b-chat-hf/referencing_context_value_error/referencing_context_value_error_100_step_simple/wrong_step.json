The correct calculation should be x = 63.33 + 16.67, as the new total quantity of water in the mixture should be the sum of the current quantity of water and the quantity of water to be further added, not the difference.\n\nTherefore, the correct solution is:\n\nThe quantity of water to be further added is x = 63.33 + 16.67 = 80 liters.\n\nThe new total quantity of water in the mixture is 16.67 + x = 16.67 + 80 = 96.67 liters.\n\nThe new total quantity of milk in the mixture is 40 - x = 40 - 80 = 0 liters.\n\nThe new ratio of milk and water is 0 : 96.67, which is not the desired ratio of 1 : 2."
