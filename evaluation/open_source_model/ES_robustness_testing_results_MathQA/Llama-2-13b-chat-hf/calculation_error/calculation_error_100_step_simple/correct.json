        "question": "At a certain committee meeting only associate professors and assistant professors are present. Each associate professor has brought 2 pencils and 1 chart to the meeting, while each assistant professor has brought 1 pencil and 2 charts. If a total of 10 pencils and 8 charts have been brought to the meeting, how many people are present?",
        "original_solution": "Let a be the number of associate professors and b be the number of assistant professors.\n2a + b = 10 because each associate professor brought 2 pencils and each assistant professor brought 1 pencil.\na + 2b = 8 because each associate professor brought 1 chart and each assistant professor brought 2 charts.\nMultiplying the first equation by 2, we get 4a + 2b = 20.\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get 3a = 12.\nSo, a = 4.\nPlugging the value of a into the first equation, we get 2*4 + b = 10.\nSo, b = 2.\nThere are 4 associate professors and 2 assistant professors, so a total of 6 people are present.\n#### 6",
        "original_answer": 6.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let a be the number of associate professors and b be the number of assistant professors.\n2a + b = 10 because each associate professor brought 2 pencils and each assistant professor brought 1 pencil.\na + 2b = 8 because each associate professor brought 1 chart and each assistant professor brought 2 charts.\nMultiplying the first equation by 2, we get 4a + 2b = 22.\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get 3a = 14.\nSo, a = 14 / 3.\nPlugging the value of a into the first equation, we get 2*(14 / 3) + b = 10.\nSo, b = 10 - 28 / 3.\nSo, b = (30 - 28) / 3.\nSo, b = 2 / 3.\nThere are 14 / 3 associate professors and 2 / 3 assistant professors, so a total of 16/3 or approximately 5.33 people are present.\n#### 5.33",

        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this case, the transformed_solution contains a miscalculation in step 4, where the multiplication of 2 by the first equation is incorrectly carried out as 4a + 2b = 22 instead of 4a + 2b = 20. This single error affects all subsequent steps that rely on it. As a result, step 5 becomes 3a = 14 rather than 3a = 12, and consequently in step 6, the value of a is incorrectly calculated using the wrong 3a value, giving a = 14 / 3 instead of 4. This error flows through to step 7, 8 and 9, where the value of b and the total number of people are calculated based on this incorrect number of associate professors a. Thus, the entire transformed solution carries the initial miscalculation through all related steps, resulting in a wrong answer of approximately 5.33 people instead of the correct answer of 6 people.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #4, which must be an integer, and the explanation is #, which is your explanation about why the [Solution] is incorrect.\n\nThe mistake occurs in step #4, where the equation 4a + 2b = 22 is incorrect. The correct equation should be 4a + 2b = 20, not 22. This mistake leads to the incorrect final answer of 5.33."
