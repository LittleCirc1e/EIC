        "question": "the present ages of abi and suji are in the ratio of 5:4 respectively. 3 years hence, the ratio of their ages will become 11:9 respectively. what is suji's present age in years?",
        "original_solution": "Let's assume the present age of abi and suji are 5x and 4x respectively.\nThree years hence, the age of abi will be 5x + 3 and the age of suji will be 4x + 3.\nAccording to the given condition, (5x + 3)/(4x + 3) = 11/9.\nSolving the above equation, we get x = 6.\nHence, suji's present age = 4x = 4 * 6 = 24 years.\n#### 24",
        "original_answer": 24.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let's assume the present age of abi and suji are 5x and 4x respectively.\nThree years hence, the age of abi will be 5x + 3 and the age of suji will be 4x + 3.\nAccording to the given condition, (5x + 3)/(4x + 3) = 11/9.\nSolving the above equation, we get x = 5.\nHence, suji's present age = 4x = 4 * 5 = 20 years.\n#### 20",

        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This case mistakenly calculates the variable x as 5 instead of 6 in step 4. This single error affects the subsequent step, which calculates suji's present age. So, step 5 which originally calculated suji's age as 4 * 6 = 24 years now incorrectly calculates it as 4 * 5 = 20 years. Previous steps are unaffected as the error only originates at step 4.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 4, and the explanation is that step 4 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating (5x + 3)/(4x + 3) = 11/9 instead of 11/8, resulting in the final incorrect answer. The subsequent step 5 references the result of step 4, calculating 11/9 = 1.22 instead of 11/8 = 1.375, resulting in the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 4."
