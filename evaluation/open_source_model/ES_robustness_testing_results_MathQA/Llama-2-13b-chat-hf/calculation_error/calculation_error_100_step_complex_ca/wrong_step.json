        "original_solution": "Probability = 1 - (1 - 2/3) * (1 - 1/2) = 1 - (1/3) * (1/2)\nProbability = 1 - (1/6)\nProbability = 5/6\n#### 5/6",

        "explanation": "In this case, the error was introduced in the last step of the calculation, by changing the correct probability from 5/6 to 4/6. The steps before the error (steps 1 and 2) are not affected and remain unchanged. Step 3 transforms 1 - (1/6) to 4/6 instead of the correct 5/6, thus introducing the error that carries over to the final answer.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 5, and the explanation is that step 5 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 120+24+24=138 instead of 120+24+24=168. The subsequent step 6 references the result of step 5, calculating 138/3=46 instead of 168/3=56, resulting in the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 5."
