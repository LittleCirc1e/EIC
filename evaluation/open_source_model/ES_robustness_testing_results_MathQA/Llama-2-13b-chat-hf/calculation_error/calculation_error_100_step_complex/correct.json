        "question": "the present ages of abi and suji are in the ratio of 5:4 respectively. 3 years hence, the ratio of their ages will become 11:9 respectively. what is suji's present age in years?",
        "original_solution": "Let's assume the present age of abi and suji are 5x and 4x respectively.\nThree years hence, the age of abi will be 5x + 3 and the age of suji will be 4x + 3.\nAccording to the given condition, (5x + 3)/(4x + 3) = 11/9.\nSolving the above equation, we get x = 6.\nHence, suji's present age = 4x = 4 * 6 = 24 years.\n#### 24",
        "original_answer": 24.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let's assume the present age of abi and suji are 5x and 4x respectively.\nThree years hence, the age of abi will be 5x + 3 and the age of suji will be 4x + 3.\nAccording to the given condition, (5x + 3)/(4x + 3) = 11/9.\nSolving the above equation, we get x = 5.\nHence, suji's present age = 4x = 4 * 5 = 20 years.\n#### 20",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This case mistakenly calculates the variable x as 5 instead of 6 in step 4. This single error affects the subsequent step, which calculates suji's present age. So, step 5 which originally calculated suji's age as 4 * 6 = 24 years now incorrectly calculates it as 4 * 5 = 20 years. Previous steps are unaffected as the error only originates at step 4.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 4, and the explanation is that step 4 first makes a mistake in unit conversion and mistakenly believes that one year has 3 months instead of 12 months, calculating 3 x 3 = 9 instead of 3 x 12 = 36. The subsequent step 5 references the result of step 4, calculating 5x + 9 = 5 * 12 + 9 = 60 + 9 = 69 instead of 5x + 36 = 5 * 12 + 36 = 60 + 36 = 96. The subsequent step 6 references the result of step 5, calculating 69 / 3 = 23 instead of 96 / 3 = 32. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 4."
