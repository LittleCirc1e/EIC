The erroneous solution proceeds correctly with the incorrect value to divide it by 3, which results in 1 / 27. The original solution's related step <(1 / 3) # 3 = (1 / 3) ^ 2 / 3 = 1 / 9> remains the same in the transformed solution, as only the numerical result changes due to the wrong calculation. The subsequent step includes the incorrect intermediate result but correctly applies the given operation. All other steps are correctly computed.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 2, and the explanation is that step 2 first makes a mistake in unit conversion and mistakenly believes that one number has 27 minutes instead of 60 minutes, calculating 1 / 3 = 1 / 27 instead of 1 / 3 = 1 / 6. The subsequent step 3 references the result of step 2, calculating 1 / 27 instead of 1 / 6. The subsequent step 4 references the result of step 3, calculating 1 / 27 = 1 / 27 instead of 1 / 6 = 1 / 6. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 2.\n\nPlease note that the correct answer is 1 / 3 = 1 / 6."
