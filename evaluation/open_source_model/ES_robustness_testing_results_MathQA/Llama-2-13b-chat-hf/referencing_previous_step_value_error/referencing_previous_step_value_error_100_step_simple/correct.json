        "transformed_solution": "Let the number be x.\nTherefore, x = 6a + 3, where a is the quotient.\nThen x^2 = 36a^2 + 36a + 9 = 6(6a^2 + 6a + 2) + 1, which means when the square of the number is divided by 6, the remainder is 1.\n#### 1",

        "explanation": "Step 3 mistakenly references 6a^2 + 6a + 1 as 6a^2 + 6a + 2 from step 2 and changes 6(6a^2 + 6a + 1) + 3 to 6(6a^2 + 6a + 2) + 1. It should be noted that step 2 in the transformed_solution <Therefore, x = 6a + 3, where a is the quotient.> should be the same as the step 2 in the original_solution <Therefore, x = 6a + 3, where a is the quotient.> and calculates its result x = 6a + 3 correctly. The error in step 3 leads to the incorrect conclusion that the remainder is 1 instead of 3, as the original solution correctly stated. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all steps is still correct.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #3, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nIn step #3, the equation x^2 = 36a^2 + 36a + 9 is incorrect. The correct equation should be x^2 = 36a^2 + 36a + 10, since the square of 3 is 9, not 1. Therefore, the final answer should be 6a + 4, not 6a + 2.\n\nThe root cause of the mistake is the incorrect equation in step #3, which leads to a wrong remainder of 1 instead of the correct remainder of 4."
