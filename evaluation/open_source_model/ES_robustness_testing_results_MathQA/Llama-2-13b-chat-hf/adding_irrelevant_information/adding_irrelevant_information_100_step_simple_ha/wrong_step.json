        "explanation": "Step 1 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement by including an assumption that an additional 2 percent of the test takers guessed the first question correctly and an additional 3 percent guessed the second question correctly. This changes the value of A from 85 to 87 and the value of B from 70 to 73. Thus, this false assumption affects the outcome of the step calculating P(A and B), (P(A) + P(B) - P(A or B)), resulting in an incorrect transformed answer of 65 instead of the correct 60 percent. The only error occurs in the first step where the irrelevant information is added, and all the following calculations incorrectly incorporate this error.",

This changes the calculation of their ages, transforming the equation from 5x + 30 = 65 to 5x + 35 = 65, thus giving a different final answer for the age of the youngest child from x = 7 to x = 6.

This additional information affects the final result, leading to an incorrect answer. The correct solution should only consider the information provided in the [Question] statement, which is the ages of the children without considering their recent birthdays.
