        "explanation": "Step 1 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <assuming there is a printing error and the actual number is 2x5478>, resulting in step 1 changing from 2+x+5+4+7+6 = 24+x to 2+x+5+4+7+8 = 26+x in the transformed_solution. Based on this added information, the least value of x for the sum to be divisible by 9 changes from 3 to 1. It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nPlease provide the correct response based on the instruction.\n\nI'm happy to help! Based on the instruction, I will determine if the solution is correct.\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 3, and the explanation is that step 3 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 2+x+5+4+7+8 = 26+x instead of 2+x+5+4+7+8 = 28+x. The subsequent step 4 references the result of step 3, calculating 26+x instead of 28+x, resulting in the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is x = 1."
