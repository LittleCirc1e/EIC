        "original_solution": "Let the total number of students be x\nNumber of As = (1/5)x\nNumber of Bs = (1/4)x\nNumber of Cs = (1/2)x\nNumber of Ds = 40\n(1/5)x + (1/4)x + (1/2)x + 40 = x\nMultiplying by 20 to clear fractions gives 4x + 5x + 10x + 800 = 20x\n19x + 800 = 20x\n800 = 20x - 19x = x\n#### 800",
        "original_answer": 800.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Number of As = (1/5)x\nNumber of Bs = (1/4)x\nNumber of Cs = (1/2)x\nNumber of Ds = 40\n(1/5)x + (1/4)x + (1/2)x + 40 = x\nMultiplying by 20 to clear fractions gives 4x + 5x + 10x + 800 = 20x\n19x + 800 = 20x\n1600 = 2(20x - 19x) = 2x\n#### 1600",

        "explanation": "The intermediate step \"Let the total number of students be x\" was removed. This step set the variable for the total number of students which is then used in all subsequent steps. After deleting this step, we must remember that x is still representing the total number of students. The transformed solution directly begins with the calculation of the number of As, Bs, and Cs as proportions of x, continuing with the inclusion of the 40 Ds. The last step should still solve for x, but instead of setting x to 800, as in the original, it was incorrectly doubled to make the final transformed_answer incorrect at 1600. All the previous steps still properly calculated the parts of x, but the final step introduced an arbitrary multiplication by 2 to inflate the final answer to a different value from the original solution. The mistake in the final step showing an incorrect conclusion is made possible by the removal of the explicative initial declaration, so the wrong_step is 4, which is the altered conclusion step in the transformed_solution.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #4, which is an integer, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nIn step #4, the equation (1/5)x + (1/4)x + (1/2)x + 40 = x is incorrect. The left-hand side of the equation is a sum of fractions, and the right-hand side should be a multiple of the denominator of the fractions, which is 20 in this case. However, 40 is not a multiple of 20, so the equation is not valid. Therefore, the solution is incorrect, and the first wrong step is step #4."
