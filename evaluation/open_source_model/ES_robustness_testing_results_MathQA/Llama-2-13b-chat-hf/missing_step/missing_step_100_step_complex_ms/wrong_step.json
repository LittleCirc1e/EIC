        "question": "What will be the fraction of 8 %?",
        "original_solution": "To find the fraction of a percentage, you divide the percentage by 100. So, 8% as a fraction is 8/100, which simplifies to 2/25.\n#### 2/25",

        "explanation": "The transformed_solution eliminates the first step which explains the process of converting a percentage to a fraction. Hence, the transformed_solution proceeds directly with converting 8% to a fraction as 8/100. However, instead of simplifying this fraction to 2/25, an intentional error is introduced in the simplification process that results in an incorrect fraction of 4/50. Since the transformation starts from the middle of the original solution (skipping the explanation about dividing by 100), the wrong_step is 1. Note that the fraction 4/50 is equivalent to 2/25, so to ensure the transformed_answer is different, we will choose 4/50.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nPlease provide the correct solution.\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 3, and the explanation is that the first erroneous step is step 3, which directly calculates 8% as a fraction without simplifying it. There is a necessary step missing here to simplify 8/100 as 2/25. Step 3 should calculate 2/25 instead of 2/25. This also affects the subsequent step 4, where 2/25 is calculated instead of 2/25. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 3.\n\nPlease provide the correct solution."

        "question": "What is the time required for a bike to cover a distance of 450 km with a speed of 90 kmh ?",

        "explanation": "In this case, we have incorrectly modified step 1 to imply a longer time, resulting in an arithmetic error where the division is performed incorrectly. Instead of dividing 450 by 90 to get 5 hours, we erroneously modified it to '450 km / 90 kmh = 10 hours' without changing the division process, leading to an inaccurate time calculation. The correct division would still result in 5 hours, not 10. Thus, the wrong_step is 1, which involves the incorrect calculation, constituting a 'calculation_error'. There is only a single error introduced in the transformation.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nPlease provide the correct solution.\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 2, and the explanation is that the first erroneous step is step 2, which directly divides the distance by the speed without considering the time unit. The correct step should be 2 * 60 = 120, which is the time in minutes.\n\nThe correct solution is:\n\nTime = 450 km / (90 km/h) = 450 / 90 = 5\n\nTherefore, the time required for a bike to cover a distance of 450 km with a speed of 90 km/h is 5 hours.\n\nThe first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 2."

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 has been removed, which calculated Shekhar's current age, and is also the step that provides the base age for calculating Shobha's age. The modified solution skips the calculation of Shekhar's current age and refers directly to his age after 6 years, which is 26. Since step 1 references a number from the question (Shekhar's age after 6 years), the subsequent step that references the result of step 1 now refers back to the age of Shekhar after 6 years instead. As the next step originally multiplied Shekhar's current age by (3/4) to get Shobha's current age, the transformation led to 26 * (3/4), the largest number provided by the context of the original step 1. This is an error because the age after 6 years was used instead of the current age, giving an inflated number for Shobha's age. It is the first step in the transformed_solution, which references the incorrect number (26 years after 6 years), so the wrong_step is 1.",
