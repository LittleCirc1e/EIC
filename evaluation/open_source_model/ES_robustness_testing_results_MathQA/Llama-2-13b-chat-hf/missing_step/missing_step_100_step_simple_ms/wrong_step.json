The correct formula for the area of a rhombus is A = (side length)^2, where side length is the length of one side of the rhombus.

Step 3 references the result 20x from step 2. After deleting step 1, step 3 is adjusted to reference 20(x-2) from the new first step and changes the formula from 20x = 22x - 44 to 20x - 40 = 22x - 44.
