        "explanation": "This example removes intermediate step 2. In the original_solution, step 2 references the winning candidate receiving 56% of x and step 3 references the other candidate receiving 44% of x, both of which use the total votes x. After deleting step 2, step 4 should reference 56% directly from the question and change the formula from 0.56x - 0.44x = 288 to 0.56x - 0.44x = 288, thus not requiring any actual change in computation. However, an error was introduced at step 4 by incorrectly solving x = 288 / 0.12 as 2400. To create a transformed solution, we can introduce the error by changing the actual computation to x = 288 / 0.12 = 2700, thus making the calculation incorrect. All other steps remain unmodified, but the error in calculation leads to a different result for the number of votes casted for the winning candidate. Since the error occurs in the fourth step of the transformed_solution, which is also the fifth step in the original_solution, the wrong_step is 4.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nPlease provide your response here.\n\nPlease note that the solution provided is incorrect, and the first wrong step is step #4. The correct explanation is that the calculation 0.12x = 288 is incorrect, as it should be 0.12x = 2400, since the total votes casted is 2400. Therefore, the number of votes casted for the winning candidate is 56% of 2400, which is 1344.\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #4, and the explanation is that the calculation 0.12x = 288 is incorrect.

        "explanation": "The intermediate step \"Let the total number of students be x\" was removed. This step set the variable for the total number of students which is then used in all subsequent steps. After deleting this step, we must remember that x is still representing the total number of students. The transformed solution directly begins with the calculation of the number of As, Bs, and Cs as proportions of x, continuing with the inclusion of the 40 Ds. The last step should still solve for x, but instead of setting x to 800, as in the original, it was incorrectly doubled to make the final transformed_answer incorrect at 1600. All the previous steps still properly calculated the parts of x, but the final step introduced an arbitrary multiplication by 2 to inflate the final answer to a different value from the original solution. The mistake in the final step showing an incorrect conclusion is made possible by the removal of the explicative initial declaration, so the wrong_step is 4, which is the altered conclusion step in the transformed_solution.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #4, which must be an integer, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nIn step #4, the equation (1/5)x + (1/4)x + (1/2)x + 40 = x is incorrect. The left-hand side of the equation is a sum of fractions, while the right-hand side is a single number (20x). This is a missing step error, as we need to first convert each fraction to a common denominator before adding them.\n\nCorrected solution:\n\nNumber of As = (1/5)x\nNumber of Bs = (1/4)x\nNumber of Cs = (1/2)x\nNumber of Ds = 40\n(1/5)x + (1/4)x + (1/2)x + 40 = x\n(1/5)x + (1/4)x + (1/2)x + 40 = x\n(1/5)x + (1/4)x + (1/2)x = 40x\nMultiplying by 20 to clear fractions gives 4x + 5x + 10x + 800 = 20x\n19x + 800 = 20x\n1600 = 2(20x - 19x) = 2x\n#### 1600.\n\nTherefore, the correct solution is:\n\nThe number of students in the course is 1600."
