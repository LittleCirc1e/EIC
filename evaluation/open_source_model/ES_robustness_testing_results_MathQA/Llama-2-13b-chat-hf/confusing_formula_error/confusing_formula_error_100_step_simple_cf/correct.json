        "original_solution": "Let x be the width of the rectangle.\nThen the length of the rectangle is 150/x.\nAccording to the given ratio, 2(150/x + x) = 5x.\nSolving this equation, we get x = 10.\n#### 10",
        "original_answer": 10.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the width of the rectangle.\nThen the length of the rectangle is 150+x.\nAccording to the given ratio, 2(150+x + x) = 5x.\nSolving this equation, we do not get a proper value for x as this equation becomes invalid.\n#### -1",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In step 2 of the transformed_solution, the area of the rectangle formula has been confused with the perimeter formula. Instead of calculating the length as 150/x, which is using the correct area formula (area = width * length), the transformed_solution incorrectly uses the sum of length and width (150 + x) which does not correctly calculate the length based on the given area and leads to a meaningless equation when trying to apply the ratio of perimeter to width, 2(150+x + x) = 5x. This mistake affects the equality and the calculation of x, leading to an incorrect transformed_answer. The explanation does not include the thinking process or step-by-step generation but simply describes the specific formula confusion error and its consequence on the outcome.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #2, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nIn step #2, the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is used incorrectly. The formula should be P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width of the rectangle. However, in the solution, the formula for the area of a rectangle is used instead, which is A = lw. This mistake leads to the equation becoming invalid and unable to produce a proper value for x. Therefore, the first wrong step is step #2, and the solution is incorrect."
