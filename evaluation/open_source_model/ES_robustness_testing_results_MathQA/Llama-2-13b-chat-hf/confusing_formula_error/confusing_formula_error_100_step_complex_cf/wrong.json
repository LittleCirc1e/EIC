        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the area with the circumference of the circle. The question requires the area of the circle to be solved using the formula π*(radius)^2, not the circumference formula π*diameter. The original_solution calculates area involving π*(d/2)^2 becoming π*d for the circumference in the transformed_solution and subsequent steps affected by the error in step 3. The transformed_solution replaces the formula for area with the formula for circumference, erroneously deriving an increase in circumference rather than area. This results in a calculation of a 10% increase instead of the correct 21% for area. Note that the language description of step 3 < The original area of the logo is > in the original_solution remains unchanged to < The original circumference of the logo is > in the transformed_solution. It should also be noted that only step 3 erroneously uses the formula for circumference instead of area, while other steps apply correct principles for diameter and radius change.",

The correct calculation for the area of the doorway is 3 ft. * 7 ft. = 21 sq. ft.\n\nNow, let's apply this understanding to the given [Question]. The volume of the cube is given as 1728 cc, and we need to find its surface area.\n\nThe first step is to find the length of a side of the cube. Let's call the length of a side 's'.\n\nWe know that s^3 = 1728, so we can take the cube root of both sides to get s = 12.\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter of the cube. The perimeter of a cube is 12s, so the perimeter of the cube is 12 * 12 = 144 units.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is that step 2 confuses the perimeter and area formulas of a rectangle. The first wrong step is step 2, and the correct calculation for the area of the doorway is 3 ft. * 7 ft. = 21 sq. ft."

This in turn affects step 4, changing the calculation of the area with the error from (1.04x)^2 to simply 4*1.04x, and this will affect the final error percentage calculation in step 5. We have to recalculate the error percentage based on the incorrect area calculation, yielding a transformed answer of 4%.
