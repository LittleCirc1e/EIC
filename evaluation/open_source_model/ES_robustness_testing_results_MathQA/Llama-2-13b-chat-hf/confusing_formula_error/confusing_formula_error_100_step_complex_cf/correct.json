The correct formula for distance is 90 liters / (600 km / 100) = 0.15 liters/km, not 0.15 liters/km * 600 km = 90 liters. Step 3 and 5, as the subsequent steps of step 2, reference the wrong result of step 2, resulting in the incorrect final answer. Step 3 miscalculates 90 liters * (1200 cc / 800 cc) = 135 liters instead of 90 liters * (1200 cc / 800 cc) = 120 liters. And step 5 miscalculates 135 liters instead of 120 liters. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 2."
