        "original_solution": "First, find the mass of 1 gram of the substance in kilograms: 1 gram * (1 kg / 1000 grams) = 0.001 kg\nNow, use the given mass of 1 cubic meter of the substance to find the volume of 0.001 kg of the substance: 0.001 kg * (1,000,000 cubic centimeters / 200 kg) = 5 cubic centimeters\n#### 5",
        "original_answer": 5.0,
        "transformed_solution": "First, find the mass of 1 gram of the substance in kilograms: 1 gram / (1 kg / 1000 grams) = 1000 kg\nNow, use the given mass of 1 cubic meter of the substance to find the volume of 1000 kg of the substance: 1000 kg * (1,000,000 cubic centimeters / 200 kg) = 5,000,000 cubic centimeters\n#### 5000000",

        "wrong_type": "operation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 uses division instead of multiplication to convert grams to kilograms, resulting in an incorrect value of the mass in kilograms. The question requires converting grams to kilograms by multiplying with the conversion factor 1/1000, resulting in 0.001 kg for 1 gram in the original_solution. By mistakenly using division instead of multiplication, we get 1000 kg for 1 gram in the transformed_solution. This incorrect operation results in a subsequent incorrect calculation in step 2, changing the correct volume calculation from 0.001 kg * (1,000,000 cubic centimeters / 200 kg) = 5 cubic centimeters to an incorrect calculation of 1000 kg * (1,000,000 cubic centimeters / 200 kg) = 5,000,000 cubic centimeters. Note that only the operation in step 1 was changed from multiplication to division, the rest of the language description and math operations remain consistent with the original_solution.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 3, and the explanation is that step 3 first makes a mistake in unit conversion and mistakenly believes that 1 cubic meter has 1,000,000 cubic centimeters instead of 1,000,000 cubic meters, calculating 1000 kg * (1,000,000 cubic centimeters / 200 kg) = 5,000,000 cubic centimeters instead of 1000 kg * (1,000,000 cubic meters / 200 kg) = 500,000 cubic meters. The subsequent step 5 references the result of step 3, calculating 5,000,000 / 3 = 500,000 instead of 500,000 / 3 = 166,667. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 3."

        "original_solution": "First, we need to find the radius of the large sphere using the formula V = (4/3) * pi * r^3\nTherefore, r = (3V / (4pi))^(1/3) = (3*10976 / (4*3.14))^(1/3)\nAfter calculation, we find r = 22 feet\nNext, we find the volume of a hemisphere using the formula V = (2/3) * pi * r^3\nV = (2/3) * 3.14 * 22^3 = (2/3) * 3.14 * 10648\nEach hemisphere has a volume of 707.72 l\nTherefore, the number of hemisphere required is 10976 / 4 = 2744\n#### 2744",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 4 confuses the volume and surface area of a hemisphere. The question requires that the volume of the hemisphere to be solved be equal to (2/3) * pi * r^3, rather than 4 * pi * r^2, which is equivalent to the surface area of a sphere, resulting in V = (2/3) * pi * r^3 in the original_solution becoming V = 4 * pi * r^2 in the transformed_solution. This leads to subsequent step 5 calculating the number of hemispheres required still using the original volume of 4 l for each hemisphere, although the calculated volume of a hemisphere has changed in step 4. As a result, the final answer changes, and the language descriptions remain unchanged. Only step 4 is using the wrong formula, while other steps maintain the correct calculations as per instructions.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 2, and the explanation is that step 2 first makes a mistake in unit conversion and mistakenly believes that one liter is equal to 0.5 gallons instead of 0.833 gallons, calculating 3*10976 / (4*3.14) = 22 instead of 3*10976 / (4*3.14) = 27.5. The subsequent step 3 references the result of step 2, calculating 22^2 = 484 instead of 27.5^2 = 722.5. The subsequent step 4 references the result of step 3, calculating 4*3.14*484 = 6075.36 instead of 4*3.14*722.5 = 9998.75.

Instead of calculating the length as 150/x, which is using the correct area formula (area = width * length), the transformed_solution incorrectly uses the sum of length and width (150 + x) which does not correctly calculate the length based on the given area and leads to a meaningless equation when trying to apply the ratio of perimeter to width, 2(150+x + x) = 5x. This mistake affects the equality and the calculation of x, leading to an incorrect transformed_answer.
