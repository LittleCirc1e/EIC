        "transformed_solution": "The total of marks obtained by reeya is 55 + 67 + 76 + 82 + 55 = 335\nThe total number of subjects is 4\nThe average marks obtained by reeya is 335 / 4 = 83.75\n#### 83.75",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 erroneously counts the number of subjects as 4 instead of 5. This counting error results in the incorrect calculation of the average in step 3, which changes from 335 / 5 = 67 to 335 / 4 = 83.75. The rest of the steps in the transformed_solution and the calculations done before the wrong step in the original_solution are correct, which keeps the error isolated to a single instance.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #2, which must be an integer, and the explanation is #, which is your explanation about why the [Solution] is incorrect.\n\nThe correct solution is:\n\nThe total of marks obtained by reeya is 55 + 67 + 76 + 82 + 55 = 335\nThe total number of subjects is 4\nThe average marks obtained by reeya is 335 / 4 = 83.5\n#### 83.5.\n\nThe error in the [Solution] is that the formula for calculating the average is incorrect. The formula should be (335 / 4) instead of (335 / 4) = 83.75. The error is due to the counting error, where the total number of subjects is 4 instead of 5, which leads to an incorrect result."
