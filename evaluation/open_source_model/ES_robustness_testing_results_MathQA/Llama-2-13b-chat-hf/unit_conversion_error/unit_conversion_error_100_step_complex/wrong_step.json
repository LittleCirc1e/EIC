        "original_solution": "Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the ratio of 12 minutes to 1 hour is 12/60 = 1/5.\n#### 1/5",
        "original_answer": "1/5",
        "transformed_solution": "Since there are 50 minutes in an hour, the ratio of 12 minutes to 1 hour is 12/50 = 6/25.\n#### 6/25",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes an incorrect unit conversion, stating there are 50 minutes in an hour instead of the correct 60 minutes. This error affects the ratio calculation, changing the correct ratio of 12 minutes to 1 hour from 12/60 = 1/5 to an incorrect value of 12/50 = 6/25 in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that only one step of unit conversion error is considered, and subsequent steps that are directly affected by the error are adjusted accordingly without affecting the previous or unrelated steps.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 3, and the explanation is that step 3 first makes a mistake in unit conversion and mistakenly believes that one hour has 25 minutes instead of 60 minutes, calculating 12/50 = 6/25 instead of 12/60 = 2/20. The subsequent step 4 references the result of step 3, calculating 6/25 instead of 2/20, resulting in the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 3."
