Instead of calculating the length as 150/x, which is using the correct area formula (area = width * length), the transformed_solution incorrectly uses the sum of length and width (150 + x) which does not correctly calculate the length based on the given area and leads to a meaningless equation when trying to apply the ratio of perimeter to width, 2(150+x + x) = 5x. This mistake affects the equality and the calculation of x, leading to an incorrect transformed_answer. The explanation does not include the thinking process or step-by-step generation but simply describes the specific formula confusion error and its consequence on the outcome.",
