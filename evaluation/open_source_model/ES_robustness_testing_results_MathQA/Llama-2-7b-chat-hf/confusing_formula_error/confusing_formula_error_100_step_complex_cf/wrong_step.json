The question asks for the surface area, requiring the use of the formula 2*(l*w + w*h + h*l), but the transformed solution incorrectly uses the volume formula (l*w*h). The language description of step 1 < The surface area of the cuboid is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. However, the calculation changes to reflect volume instead, which affects the answer in the transformed_solution. In this example, only step 1 mistakes the formula for the cuboid surface area, while the other steps, including the language used and calculations, correctly calculate volume based on the revised step 1.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 2, and the explanation is that step 2 confuses the formula for the volume of a cube with the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism. That means, it should calculate (l*w*h) = (2b*b*b) = 2b^3 instead of (l*w*h) = (2b*b*b) = 4b^3. Step 3 and 5, as the subsequent steps of step 2, reference the wrong result of step 2, resulting in the incorrect final answer. Step 3 miscalculates 4b^3 + 4b^3 = 8b^3 instead of 2b^3. And step 5 miscalculates 640 sq. ft. - 8b^3 = 552 sq. ft. instead of 640 sq. ft. - 2b^3 = 560 sq. ft. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 2."

This affects the subsequent related steps, changing the quadratics and their resolution to a linear equation and its resolution.

The question requires that the volume of the cube to be solved be equal to the side length cubed, not 3 times the square of the side length, which is a dimensionally incorrect representation of surface area (and not even the correct formula for surface area). This error results in the original equation x^3=64 being replaced by 3*x*x=64, thus solving for x gives an incorrect value, approximately 4.62 instead of the correct 4. The subsequent steps apply the incorrect side length to determine the new cube's measurements and volume. Therefore, step 2 from  x^3=64 has been modified to 3*x*x=64 in the transformed_solution, and this single incorrect application of a formula results in a subsequently incorrect computed volume of 787.305 cubic feet instead of the correct 512 cubic feet.
