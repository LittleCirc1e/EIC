        "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the volume and surface area of a cube. The question requires that the volume of each cube to be solved be equal to the edge length cubed, rather than 3 sides multiplied by 2, which is equivalent to the surface area of a cube, resulting in 3*3*3=27 cubic units in the original_solution becoming 3*3*6=54 cubic units in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent related step 3, changing from 1296/27=48 to 1296/54=24. Note that the language description of step 2 <The volume of each cube is> in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes must still be correct. In this example, only step 2 mistakenly uses the formula for the surface area of a cube, while the other calculation processes are still correct.",

However, in the transformed_solution, the surface area was mistakenly calculated using volume values, giving (6x^3)/(6y^3) instead of (6x^2)/(6y^2), resulting in a wrong ratio of 1/27 as the transformed_answer.

This approach reflects a single error in the solution process where the description remains unchanged—the formula for calculating the area, however, is incorrectly transformed while the arithmetic operation based on the wrong formula is performed correctly.",

The perimeter of a square is given by 4 times the side length, while the area is given by the side squared. Thus, in the transformed solution, the calculation of the actual area of the square is mistakenly changed from x^2 to 4*x, the formula for the perimeter. This in turn affects step 4, changing the calculation of the area with the error from (1.04x)^2 to simply 4*1.04x, and this will affect the final error percentage calculation in step 5. We have to recalculate the error percentage based on the incorrect area calculation, yielding a transformed answer of 4%. Note that the language description of step 3 in the original solution <The actual area of the square is > remains unchanged in the transformed solution. The other steps related to calculation in the transformed solution are adjusted accordingly to maintain logical coherence after the initial error.",
