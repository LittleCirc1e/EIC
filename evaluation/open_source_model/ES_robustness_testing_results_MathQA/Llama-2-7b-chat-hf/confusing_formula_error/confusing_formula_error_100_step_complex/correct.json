Instead of using the correct relationships of lw = 120, lh = 72, and wh = 60 to solve for the dimensions, it incorrectly changes one relationship, stating that h = 60/w instead of using w = 60/h. This change affects the subsequent calculations resulting in an incorrect value for the height of the box (using h = 60/w instead of w = 60/h), which in turn affects the computation of the box's volume. The correct relationships between the sides are not maintained, introducing the error in the transformed_solution at step 5. This changes the volume calculation from lwh = 12 * 10 * 6 = 720 cubic cm to an incorrect lwh = 12 * 10 * 10 = 1200 cubic cm.
