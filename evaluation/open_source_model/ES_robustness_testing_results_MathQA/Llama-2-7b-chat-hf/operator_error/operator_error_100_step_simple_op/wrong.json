        "explanation": "This case changes the multiplication operator in the original solution to addition. In step 2, instead of x(x+1)(x+2) = 210, it is changed to x(x+1)+x+2 = 210. This leads to a different equation and therefore to different solutions for x. Since the next steps depend on the value of x obtained in step 2, all of them are affected and therefore changed, yet the calculations are performed correctly based on the altered equation. The final answer for the sum of the smallest two numbers is consequently different from the original one.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. The solution is correct because the formula x(x+1)(x+2) = 210 is correct, and the calculations are accurate. The smallest two numbers are x and x+1, and their sum is 13.46 + 14.46 = 27.92, which is the correct answer."

        "explanation": "The operator in step 1 was changed from division to multiplication which should convert speed from km/h to m/s but instead gave an implausible speed of 129600 m/s due to multiplying where you should divide. This resulted in an incorrect calculation of the duration it would take the train to pass the telegraph post: instead of dividing the length of the train by a reasonable speed in m/s, it's divided by an excessively large incorrect value of speed. All other steps are correctly calculated based on the transformed values, but the outcome of the wrong step leads to an incorrect result that is significantly different from the original result.",
