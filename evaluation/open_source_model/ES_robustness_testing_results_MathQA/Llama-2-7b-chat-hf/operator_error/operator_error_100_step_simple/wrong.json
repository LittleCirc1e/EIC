The calculation in the modified step 2 is correct, but the result is incorrect due to using the wrong operation. All other steps correctly calculate based on the values they are given.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. The first wrong step is step #2, because the average of b and c is not equal to the average of b and a. The correct calculation is:\n\nThe sum of a and b is 35 * 2 = 70 because the average of a and b is 35.\nThe sum of b and c is 80 + 2 = 82 because the average of b and c is 80.\nThe sum of b and c minus the sum of a and b is 82 - 70 = 12.\nThe value of c - a is 12. #12."

This changed the original equation '3x * 4x * 7x = 18144' to the incorrect '3x * 4x / 7x = 18144'.

This transformation leads to a single error in the second step, which then affects all subsequent steps that rely on the result of that erroneous step.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. The solution is correct because the product of the three numbers is indeed 18144, and the ratio of the three numbers is 3:4:7.
