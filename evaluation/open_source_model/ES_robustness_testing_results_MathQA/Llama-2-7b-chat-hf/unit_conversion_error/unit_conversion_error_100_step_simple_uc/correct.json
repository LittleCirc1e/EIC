It should be noted that only the unit conversion in step 2 is affected, while the calculations in step 1 and the rest of the process remain correct.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #2, which must be an integer. The explanation is # The conversion from minutes to hours is incorrect, as there are 60 minutes in an hour, not 5 minutes.

        "question": "A leak in the bottom of a tank can empty the full tank in 6 hours. An inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute. When the tank is full, the inlet is opened and due to the leak, the tank is empty in 12 hours. How many litres does the cistern hold?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the capacity of the tank in litres.\nThe inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute, so in 12 hours it fills 6 * 12 * 60 = 4320 litres.\nThe leak can empty the tank in 6 hours, so in 12 hours it can empty 2x litres.\nNow, 4320 - 2x = x. Solving for x, we get x = 4320.\n#### 4320",
        "original_answer": 4320.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the capacity of the tank in litres.\nThe inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute, so in 12 hours it fills 6 * 12 * 50 = 3600 litres.\nThe leak can empty the tank in 6 hours, so in 12 hours it can empty 2x litres.\nNow, 3600 - 2x = x. Solving for x, we get x = 3600 / 3 = 1200.\n#### 1200",

        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means that 1 hour wrongly has 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes, resulting in 6 * 12 * 60 = 4320 litres in the original_solution becoming 6 * 12 * 50 = 3600 litres in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 4, which changes from 4320 - 2x = x to 3600 - 2x = x and the solution from x = 4320 to x = 3600 / 3 = 1200 litres for the capacity of the tank. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, so the other calculation processes related to the rate of the leak are still correct.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #2, which must be an integer. The explanation is # The solution assumes that the inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute for the entire 12 hours, which is incorrect. In reality, the inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute only during the first 6 hours, and then the leak empties the tank at a rate of 2x litres per hour, which is not taken into account in the solution. Therefore, the correct answer is 1200 - 2x = 1200 - 2(1200) = 600 litres."
