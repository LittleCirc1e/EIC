And it affects the subsequent related step 4, which changes from 7x + 210 = 5x - 1050 to 7x + 210 = 5x - 700. Step 5 changes from 2x = -1260, so x = -630 to 2x = -910, so x = -455. The final correct distance remains positive; thus, the child is 455 meters from his school in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",

This then also changes the multiplication factor in step 5, which was originally 90x(3600) and becomes 90x(3500) in the transformed_solution. As such, the right-hand side of the equation in step 6 changes due to this incorrect multiplication, and this error propagates through the following steps until the final answer, which is incorrect as well.
