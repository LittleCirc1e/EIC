It erroneously references 4 as 1, causing the formula to calculate 12 x (1/4) = 3 instead of 12 x (1/1) = 12. This affects subsequent steps 3, 4, and 5 that reference its result. Step 3 incorrectly calculates 3 x 16 = 48 instead of 12 x 16 = 192. Step 4 incorrectly calculates 48 x 3 = 144 instead of 192 x 3 = 576. And step 5 incorrectly calculates 144 + 144 + 144 = 422 instead of 576 + 576 + 576 = 1728. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 2."
