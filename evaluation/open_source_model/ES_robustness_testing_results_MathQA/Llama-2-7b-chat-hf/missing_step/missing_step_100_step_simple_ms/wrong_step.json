Consequently, step 2 should reference the result from the question, which is 50 doughnuts equivalent to 5 parts. The reference to each part being equivalent to 10 still holds as the calculation method is correct, but since we consider there to be 10 parts of muffins instead of 1, step 2 should be modified to reflect a 1:1 part ratio between doughnuts and muffins. Given there are 50 doughnuts, the calculation changes to 50 x 1 = 50 for the number of muffins, which should ultimately modify the formula to 50 x 1 = 50. It should be noted that the calculation in step 3 maintains the error and refers incorrectly to '10 parts of muffins', as the initial step that created the incorrect carryover effect from the deletion is step 1, thus it is marked as the wrong_step. The transformed_solution erroneously states that there are 100 muffins due to incorrectly maintaining the original step 4 calculation without adjusting for the altered quantity suggested by the deleted step 1 (10 parts was used instead of the correct 1 part, leading to multiplying by 10 instead of 1).",

The wrong_step is 1 because in the transformed solution, it is the first step that incorrectly references the price of a pair of rackets as $10 instead of $9.8, which results in the transformed_answer being different from the original_answer, as required.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #3, which must be an integer. The explanation is # The solution is incorrect because it divides the total sales by the price of a single racket instead of the average price of a pair of rackets.

In the original solution, the second step defines the length of the train 'x', and step 4 computes the train's speed over the 250 m platform, which relies on the initial speed equation. By removing the speed equation step, subsequent steps should rely on the given information. Step 4 became the initial step and affected all following steps. In the transformed solution, the original steps 3 and 4 to find the train's speed over the two platforms are consolidated by taking the second platform's equation as a reference. The original step 5's equation simplifies the relationship between the two speeds, which in the transformed solution becomes step 2. Step 3 eliminates the denominator from both sides (2x + 640 = x + 250), leading to step 4 (2x + 1280 = x + 250). Finally, step 5 solves for 'x', which is determined to be 1030 meters, not 140.

Therefore, the correct solution is #1030, which is the length of the train."

This changes the wording to 'He scored 210 - 48 = 162 runs by running between the wickets and boundaries' instead of '210 - 12 - 48'. The calculation in step 4 is then altered to use 162 instead of 150, changing '(150 / 210) x 100' to '(162 / 210) x 100', which results in a percentage of 77.14 instead of 71.4.

The original_solution's step 1 references the number 5 and 15 from the question, but step 1's result is not referenced by any subsequent steps directly. However, deleting it means step 2 would be invalid as it stands. By altering step 2 to reference-the largest number referenced in the original step 1, which is 15, the formula changes from 5/15 = 1/3 to 15/15 = 1, thereby eliminating the entire calculation process as 1 - 1 equals 0. All subsequent steps then reflect the calculation based on zero remaining work, leading to a transformed answer of 0 days for x to finish the 'remaining' work, which mistakenly implies no work is left. It is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 2 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing incorrect number in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 1.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #3, which must be an integer. The explanation is: The amount of work done by y in 15 days is not 1, it is 15/2 = 7.5, so the amount of work remaining is 1 - 7.5 = -6.5. In 1 day, x can finish 1/21 of the work, so the remaining work can be finished in -6.5 / (1/21) = -0.03 days. Therefore, the correct answer is #-0.03 days."

In the original_solution, step 1 references the original number of men x, and step 2 references the result of step 1, the equation 20x = 22(x-2). Therefore, after deleting step 1, step 2 should become the first step and no longer reference the original number of men explicitly but rather model the same equation directly. Step 3 references the result 20x from step 2. After deleting step 1, step 3 is adjusted to reference 20(x-2) from the new first step and changes the formula from 20x = 22x - 44 to 20x - 40 = 22x - 44. Similarly, Step 4 is adjusted based on the new step 3, and becomes 44 - 40 = 22x - 20x. The final step is then updated based on step 4 and arrives at the incorrect conclusion of x = 2. It is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 2 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step that contains incorrect referencing due to the removal of the original step 1.",
