Step 5 will change 0.008y - 0.005y = 0.007 - 0.005 to 0.008y = 0.007 - 0.005, step 6 will change 0.003y = 0.002 to 0.008y = 0.002, and step 7 will change y = 0.002 / 0.003 to y = 0.002 / 0.008.

There is a necessary step missing here to convert Sunday's time from hours to minutes, which is 2 * 60=120. Step 4 should calculate 120+24+24=168 instead of 2+24+24=50. This also affects the subsequent step 5, where 50/3=16.6 is calculated instead of 168/3=56. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 4."

The combined effect has been mistaken for the total decrease in area, resulting in a calculation that only considers the intersection of the length and breadth reductions. The transformed_solution, therefore, does not add the individual percentage reductions of length and breadth, hence arriving at an incorrect answer of 4%.
