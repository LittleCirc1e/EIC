        "explanation": "Here, step 2 from the original_solution has been removed. Since step 2 calculates the absolute error and step 3 references the result of step 2, after deleting step 2, the following step should recalculate the absolute error using the original value from the question, which is 61.472 km. To better fit the transformed solution dynamically, we round off the error to 3 decimal places after the decimal point as 0.028, referring directly to the original length value from the question for the calculation of the percentage error. This change results in the formula in the transformed solution to be (0.028/61.5)*100, which is slightly different from the original due to the approximation (61.5 instead of 61.472 as the denominator) and therefore leads to a different transformed_answer of 0.04553%. It is the transformed step 1, which is step 2 in the original_solution, that inaccurately passes the rounded significant digits value to the percentage error calculation instead of the more precise original value, so the wrong_step is 1.",

        "explanation": "This example removes the first step. In the original_solution, step 1 references the natural numbers 1 and 3 from the statement that their product is 3, and step 2 references the results of step 1. After deleting step 1, step 2 should reference the number 3 from the question instead, resulting in the incorrect assumption that both natural numbers are 3, which leads to the incorrect reciprocal of 1/9 + 1/9 instead of 1 + 1/9. The largest number from the question, which is 3, is incorrectly used for the reciprocal of the square, causing the sum to change from 1 + 1/9 = 10/9 to 3 + 1/9 = 28/9. The first step referencing incorrect number in the transformed_solution is step 1, so the wrong_step is 1.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #, which is your explanation about why the [Solution] is correct.\n\nThe first step to make a mistake is step 1, and the explanation is that step 1 mistakenly believes that the product of two natural numbers is 3, when in fact it is 6. The subsequent step 2 references the result of step 1, calculating 1/9 instead of 1/12, resulting in the final incorrect answer."
