        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly calculates 2*116 as 242 instead of the correct 232. This error affects step 5, which calculates the sum of the squares as 494 instead of the correct 484. Subsequent steps correctly calculate the square root of the incorrect sum, resulting in a final incorrect sum of 22.22. We need to only consider one step error, and all other steps maintain consistency of the single introduced error.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. The solution is correct because the equation (a + b + c)^2 = 252 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ac is true, and the value of (a + b + c)^2 is 494, which is the correct answer.\n\nThe first wrong step is step #, which is the equation (a + b + c)^2 = 252 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ac. This equation is incorrect because the right-hand side is not equal to the left-hand side, and it leads to the final wrong result of (a + b + c)^2 = 494, which is not the correct answer."
