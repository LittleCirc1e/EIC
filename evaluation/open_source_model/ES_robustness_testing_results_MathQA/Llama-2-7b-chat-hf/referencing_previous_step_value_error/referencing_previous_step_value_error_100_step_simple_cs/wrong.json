Step 2 in the transformed_solution <Each ratio unit is worth Rs. 17000 / 9 = Rs. 1889> should remain the same as step 2 in the original_solution <Each ratio unit is worth Rs. 17000 / 9 = Rs. 1889>, which has been calculated correctly. Step 5 and subsequent calculations are correctly based on the erroneous result of step 4. The transformation leads to a different savings amount of Rs. 9444 compared to the original answer of Rs. 3400.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct. The first wrong step is step 4, where the value of Rs. 1889 is used in the formula without checking if it is correct. The actual value of Rs. 1889 is obtained by multiplying the ratio units by the income, which is Rs. 17000 / 9 = Rs. 1889. Therefore, the savings are Rs. 9444."
