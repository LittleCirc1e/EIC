        "explanation": "Here, a single arithmetic error is introduced in step 7 of the original_solution with the incorrect division by 2, giving x = 4. This error wrongly changes the conclusion that Bill ran 6 miles on Sunday to claiming he ran 8 miles on Sunday in the transformed_solution.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 4, and the explanation is that step 4 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 2x + 8 = 8 instead of 2x + 8 = 10. The subsequent step 5 references the result of step 4, calculating 4x = 8 instead of 4x = 10, resulting in the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 4."

The division by the number of days (which was 5 in reality but mistakenly counted as 4) is not relevant for the calculation of the percentage of books not sold. The incorrect transformation changed the calculation from a correct percentage to an incorrect value by dividing the percentage of books not sold by 4, which is unrelated to the number of days books were sold.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 4, and the explanation is that step 4 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 280 books instead of 270 books, which is the correct total number of books sold.
