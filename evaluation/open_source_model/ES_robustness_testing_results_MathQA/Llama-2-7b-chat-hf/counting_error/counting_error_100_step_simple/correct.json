        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #2, which must be an integer. The explanation is: The solution assumes that the marks obtained in each subject are added together to get the total marks, but this is not the correct approach. The correct approach is to multiply the marks obtained in each subject by a weightage factor and then add the weighted marks to get the total marks. For example, if the weightage factor for English is 2, then the marks obtained in English are multiplied by 2 to get the weighted marks. Similarly, the marks obtained in other subjects are multiplied by their respective weightage factors to get the weighted marks. Then, the total marks are calculated by adding the weighted marks of all the subjects. Therefore, the correct solution is: Add all the weighted marks: 76\\*2+65\\*2+82\\*2+67\\*2+85\\*2=1760\nDivide the total by the number of subjects: 1760/5=352.#### 352."
