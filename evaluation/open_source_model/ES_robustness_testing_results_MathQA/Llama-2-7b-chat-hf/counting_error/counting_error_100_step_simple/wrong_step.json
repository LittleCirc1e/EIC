        "original_solution": "On Saturdays, the station serves cars for 16 hours (10 pm - 6 am + 1). So the total number of cars served on Saturdays is 14 cars/hour * 16 hours = 224 cars\nOn Sundays, the station serves cars for 16 hours. So the total number of cars served on Sundays is 10 cars/hour * 16 hours = 160 cars\nFrom Monday to Friday, the station serves cars for 16 hours/day * 5 days = 80 hours. So the total number of cars served from Monday to Friday is 9 cars/hour * 80 hours = 720 cars\nThe total number of cars served over a typical week is 224 + 160 + 720 = 1104 cars\n#### 1104",

So the total number of cars served from Monday to Friday due to the incorrect count is 9 cars/hour * 64 hours = 576 cars\nThe total number of cars served over a typical week with the mistaken count is 224 + 160 + 576 = 960 cars\n#### 960",

        "explanation": "Here, a single arithmetic error is introduced in step 7 of the original_solution with the incorrect division by 2, giving x = 4. This error wrongly changes the conclusion that Bill ran 6 miles on Sunday to claiming he ran 8 miles on Sunday in the transformed_solution.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #4.\n\nThe explanation is:\nThe solution assumes that the total number of miles ran on Saturday and Sunday is equal to the sum of the number of miles Bill ran on Saturday and the number of miles he ran on Sunday. However, the problem states that Julia ran twice the number of miles on Sunday that Bill ran on Sunday, which means that the total number of miles ran on Saturday and Sunday is not equal to the sum of the number of miles Bill ran on Saturday and the number of miles he ran on Sunday. Therefore, the equation 4x + 12 = 20 does not hold, and the solution is incorrect."
