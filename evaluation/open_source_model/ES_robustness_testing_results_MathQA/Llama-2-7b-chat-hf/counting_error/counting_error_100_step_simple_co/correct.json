        "question": "Gary's gas station serves an average of 12 cars per hour on Saturdays, 10 cars per hour on Sundays, and 9 cars per hour on all other days of the week. If the station is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, how many cars does Gary's station serve over the course of a typical week?",
        "original_solution": "On Saturdays, the station is open for (10-6) + (22-10) = 16 hours. So, the total number of cars served on Saturdays is 16 * 12 = 192 cars\nOn Sundays, the station is open for (10-6) + (22-10) = 16 hours. So, the total number of cars served on Sundays is 16 * 10 = 160 cars\nOn the other days, the station is open for (10-6) + (22-10) = 16 hours each. So, the total number of cars served on other days is 16 * 9 * 5 = 720 cars\nSo, the total number of cars served in a week is 192 + 160 + 720 = 1072 cars\n#### 1072",
        "original_answer": 1072,
        "transformed_solution": "On Saturdays, the station is open for (10-6) + (22-10) = 16 hours. So, the total number of cars served on Saturdays is 16 * 12 = 192 cars\nOn Sundays, the station is open for (10-6) + (22-10) = 16 hours. So, the total number of cars served on Sundays is 16 * 10 = 160 cars\nOn the other days, the station is open for (10-6) + (22-10) = 16 hours each. So, the total number of cars served on other days is 16 * 9 * 4 = 576 cars\nSo, the total number of cars served in a week is 192 + 160 + 576 = 928 cars\n#### 928",

        "explanation": "In this transformed_solution, the mistakenly counted number of other days of the week has been changed from 5 to 4, which affects the total number served on those days, changing from 16 * 9 * 5 = 720 cars to 16 * 9 * 4 = 576 cars. The final step was also affected, changing the sum from 192 + 160 + 720 = 1072 cars to 192 + 160 + 576 = 928 cars. The transformed_answer differs from the original_answer due to the counting error, and previous steps have not been altered.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #3, which is the calculation of the number of cars served on the other days. The explanation is that the calculation is incorrect because it assumes that the station is open for 16 hours each day, when in fact it is open for 10 hours on weekdays and 12 hours on weekends. Therefore, the total number of cars served on the other days is actually 16 * 9 * 4 = 576 cars, not 576 * 4 = 2304 cars. Therefore, the final answer is #928, not #2304."
