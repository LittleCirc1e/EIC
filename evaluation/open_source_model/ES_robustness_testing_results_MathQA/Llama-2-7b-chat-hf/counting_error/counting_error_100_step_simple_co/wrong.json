        "question": "Sheila works 8 hours per day on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and 6 hours per day on Tuesday and Thursday. She does not work on Saturday and Sunday. She earns $ 396 per week. How much does she earn in dollars per hour?",
        "original_solution": "The total hours worked from Monday through Friday is 8 + 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 36 hours\nThe total number of days from Monday through Friday is 5 days\nThe average number of hours Sheila works per day is 36 / 5 = 7.2 hours\nShe earns $396 per week\nSo, she earns $396 / 36 hours = $11 per hour\n#### 11",
        "original_answer": 11.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total hours worked from Monday through Friday is 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 hours\nThe total number of days from Monday through Friday is 4 days\nThe average number of hours Sheila works per day is 28 / 4 = 7 hours\nShe earns $396 per week\nSo, she earns $396 / 28 hours = $14.14 per hour\n#### 14.14",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 erroneously counts the number of workdays as 4 instead of 5, excluding one of the 8-hour workdays. This alteration changes the total hours worked in the week from 36 to 28, leading to an incorrect calculation of the hourly wage in the later step, which changes from $396 / 36 hours = $11 per hour to $396 / 28 hours = $14.14 per hour. It should be noted that only the first step contains a counting error, and subsequent calculations are based on this mistake; however, these calculations are performed correctly based on the altered inputs.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. The first wrong step is step #, which is the calculation of the total hours worked from Monday through Friday. The calculation should be 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 30 hours, not 28 hours. Therefore, the final answer is incorrect."
