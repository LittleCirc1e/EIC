        "question": "every day daniel drives 120 miles back from work . on sunday , daniel drove all the way back from work at a constant speed of x miles per hour . on monday , daniel drove the first 32 miles back from work at ( 2 x ) miles per hour , and the rest of the way at ( x / 2 ) miles per hour . the time it took daniel to drive back from work on monday is longer than the time it took him to drive back from work on sunday by what percent ?",
        "original_solution": "The time it took Daniel to drive back from work on Sunday is 120 / x\nThe time it took Daniel to drive back from work on Monday is 32 / (2x) + 88 / (x/2)\n32 / (2x) simplifies to 16 / x and 88 / (x/2) simplifies to 176 / x\nSo, the total time on Monday is 16 / x + 176 / x = 192 / x\nThe time difference is 192 / x - 120 / x = 72 / x\nTo find the percent increase, we calculate (72 / x) / (120 / x) * 100 = 60%\n#### 60",
        "original_answer": 60.0,

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 6 should have the correct calculation of the percent increase using the values from steps 4 and 5. However, the calculation has been erroneously changed from 60% to 80% without justification, which is not a result of a counting error from the previous steps. The error does not affect the calculations of the time it took for Daniel to drive back home on Sunday and Monday but only alters the percent increase calculation step, thus changing the final percent from the correct value of 60% to an incorrect value of 80%.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 6, and the explanation is that step 6 first erroneously calculates the speed on Monday as (2x) miles per hour instead of (x/2) miles per hour, resulting in an error in the formula. And step 6 calculates 16 / x instead of 176 / x, resulting in the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the miss, is step 6."
