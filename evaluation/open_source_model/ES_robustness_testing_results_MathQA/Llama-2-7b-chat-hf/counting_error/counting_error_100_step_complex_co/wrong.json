This error transforms the calculation from 18-12 to 18-6, increasing the number of rented out trucks that could have been returned. This counting error affects step 3 by making the number appear as though 24 trucks could be rented out, which is not possible since there are only 18 trucks total.

        "question": "Gary’s gas station serves an average of 16 cars per hour on Saturdays, 10 cars per hour on Sundays, and 9 cars per hour on all other days of the week. If the station is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, how many cars does Gary’s station serve over the course of a typical week?",
        "original_solution": "On Saturdays, the station is open for 16 hours, so it serves 16 * 16 = 256 cars\nOn Sundays, the station is open for 16 hours, so it serves 16 * 10 = 160 cars\nFrom Monday to Friday, the station is open for (16 * 5) = 80 hours, so it serves 80 * 9 = 720 cars\nThe total number of cars served over the course of a typical week is 256 + 160 + 720 = 1136 cars\n#### 1136",
        "original_answer": 1136,

This changes the calculation from (16 * 5) = 80 hours to (15 * 5) = 75 hours, and subsequently, the total number of cars served from Monday to Friday changes from 80 * 9 = 720 cars to 75 * 9 = 675 cars. The final step summing up the total number of cars served during the week is then affected, with the original 256 + 160 + 720 changing to 256 + 160 + 675, resulting in a different total of 1091 cars.
