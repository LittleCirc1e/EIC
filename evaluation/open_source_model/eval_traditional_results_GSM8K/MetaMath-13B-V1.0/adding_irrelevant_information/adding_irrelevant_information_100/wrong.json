Half the books on the bottom section of the cart were mystery books, which she quickly put back into place. Then, she shelved the remaining books from the bottom of the cart, including 5 Western novels and 6 biographies. How many books did she have on the book cart when she started?",
            "original_solution": "Half of the books on the bottom section of the cart are mystery books, which means they are the same as the number of Western novels and biographies put together. So there are 5 + 6 = 11 mystery novels.\nAdd them all together, and there are 12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 11 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies = 46 books total\n#### 46",

This affects the following summation step, changing the total from \"12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 11 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies = 46 books\" to \"12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 14 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies + 3 literature = 52 books\".
