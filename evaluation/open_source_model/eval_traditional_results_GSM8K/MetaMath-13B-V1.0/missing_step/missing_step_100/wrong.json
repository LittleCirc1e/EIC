            "original_solution": "Reading 60% faster means John's brother takes 1+.6=1.6 times as long as John to read\nSo John reads a book in 8/1.6=5 hours\nSo it would take John 5*3=15 hours to read 3 books\n#### 15",

            "explanation": "Here, step 1 has been removed. In the original_solution, step 1 references the number 60% from the question, and step 2 references the result 1.6 of step 1. So after deleting step 1, step 2 should change and no longer contain a division by 1.6, but mistakenly uses division by .6 instead. Hence, the result changes incorrectly from John reading a book in 5 hours to claiming he reads it in 13.333 hours. The transformed_solution should not change from division by 1.6 to .6. The subsequent step 3 changes accordingly, from 5*3=15 to 13.333*3=40. It is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 2 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing an incorrect computation in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 1."

The original step 1 references number 20 from the question to calculate the number of tanks and step 2 references the result from step 1 to calculate the total. After deleting step 1, reference to the number of tanks is replaced by the direct calculation of 5 times the number of trucks (5*20) in the formula for the total number of trucks and tanks. This results in a single formula that serves as step 1 for the calculation: 5*20+20 = 120. The transformed solution does not have the wrong intermediate step, and hence wrong_step is 1 since it's the first step in the transformed_solution that has an error, being the step that references the result of the deleted step. The result of the total calculation is different from the original answer, ensuring that the transformed_answer is 120, not 140, which is also a logic error in the original_solution since the correct total is in fact 120."

Step 3 is adjusted accordingly to reference the recalculated price for the running boards and provide a new total cost, changing from $30,000+$7500+$2500+$2000+$1500=$43,500 to $30,000+$7500+($7500/3)+$2000+$1500=$42,000.
