        "output_str": "The area of the classroom is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height: 9m x 8m x 3m = 216 square meters.\nThe area of the windows is calculated by multiplying the length and width: 1m x 1.5m = 1.5 square meters per window.\nSo the total area of the windows is 4 windows x 1.5 square meters = 6 square meters.\nThe area of the blackboards is calculated by multiplying the length and width: 6m x 1m = 6 square meters per blackboard.\nSo the total area of the blackboards is 2 blackboards x 6 square meters = 12 square meters.\nThe area of the doors is calculated by multiplying the length and width: 2m x 1m = 2 square meters per door.\nSo the total area of the doors is 2 doors x 2 square meters = 4 square meters.\nThe total area to be painted is the area of the classroom minus the area of the windows, blackboards, and doors: 216 square meters - 6 square meters - 12 square meters - 4 square meters = 198 square meters.\nThe cost to paint the classroom is calculated by multiplying the total area to be painted by the paint fee per square meter: 198 square meters x $4.80 per square meter = $874.\n#### 874\nThe answer is: 874",

The question requires that the area of the wall to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by height, rather than the sum of all four sides, which is equivalent to the perimeter, resulting in 8 ft. * 20 ft. = 160 sq. ft. in the original_solution becoming 8 ft. + 20 ft. + 8 ft. + 20 ft. = 56 sq. ft. in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent related step, where the total wall area calculation changes from 4 * 160 sq. ft. = 640 sq. ft. to 4 * 56 sq. ft. = 224 sq. ft., and the final calculation changes from 640 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 560 sq. ft. to 224 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 144 sq. ft. Note that the language description of step 1 <The solid wall is> in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 1 mistakenly uses the formula of rectangular perimeter, while the original_solution is correct in calculating the areas of the doorway, window, and closet door, and the subtraction process in the final step."
