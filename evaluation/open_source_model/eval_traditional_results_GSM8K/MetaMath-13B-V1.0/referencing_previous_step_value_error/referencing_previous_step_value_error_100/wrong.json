        "output_str": "Donna worked 2 hours every morning walking dogs for $10.00 an hour, so she made 2 * $10.00 = $20.00 every morning.\nShe worked 5 days a week, so she made $20.00 * 5 = $100.00 every week from walking dogs.\nAfter school, she worked at a card shop for 2 hours and made $12.50 an hour, so she made 2 * $12.50 = $25.00 every day from the card shop.\nShe worked 5 days a week, so she made $25.00 * 5 = $125.00 every week from the card shop.\nOn the weekends, she usually made $10.00 an hour babysitting, so she made $10.00 * 4 = $40.00 every Saturday from babysitting.\nOver 7 days, she made $100.00 + $125.00 + $40.00 = $265.00\n#### 265\nThe answer is: 265",

It should be noted that step 5 in the transformed_solution <The total number of bottles that had a mixture of the two drinks that were dropped at the first house is 1/2*60 = 30> should be the same as the step 5 in the original_solution <The total number of bottles that had a mixture of the two drinks that were dropped at the first house is 1/2*60 = 30> and calculates its result 30 correctly. Because we consider only one error, step 5 has been unaffected and is the same as in the original solution. Subsequent step 7 is related to step 6 and is calculated correctly based on the erroneous amount from step 6, changing the final total to 60+25 = 85 instead of the correct total of 60+30 = 90.
