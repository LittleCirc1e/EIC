        "output_str": "\nTo determine how many tablespoons of soap the mother should add to the container, we need to first calculate how many cups of water she will be using. Since the container can hold 40 ounces of liquid and there are 8 ounces in a cup of water, we can divide 40 by 8 to get the number of cups:\n\n40 ÷ 8 = 5 cups\n\nNow that we know how many cups of water the mother will be using, we can use the recipe to determine how many tablespoons of soap she should add. Since the recipe calls for 3 tablespoons of soap for every 1 cup of water, we can multiply the number of cups by 3 to get the total number of tablespoons of soap:\n\n5 cups x 3 tablespoons/cup = 15 tablespoons\n\nTherefore, the mother should add 15 tablespoons of soap to the container.",
