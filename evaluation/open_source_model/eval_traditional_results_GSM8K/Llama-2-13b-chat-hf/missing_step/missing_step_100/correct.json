Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, and each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. How many barrels of wine does her farm produce per year?\n\n### Response:",
        "output_str": "\nTo determine how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to first calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced on the farm. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, and Josie has 10 acres, the total number of tons of grapes produced is:\n\n10 acres x 5 tons/acre = 50 tons/year\n\nNext, we can calculate the number of barrels of wine produced by multiplying the total number of tons of grapes by the number of barrels per ton of grapes. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate the number of barrels of wine produced as follows:\n\n50 tons/year x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels/year\n\nTherefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.",

Let's start by analyzing the information given:\n\n* Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's the first week. So, if she mowed Joe's lawn x times, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times.\n* The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. So, if she mowed Joe's lawn x times, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.\n\nSince we know that Tasha made $80 from both mowing lawns and lemonade sales, we can set up two equations:\n\nEquation 1:\n3x + 5x = 80\n\nEquation 2:\nx = 6 (since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work)\n\nNow, let's solve for x in Equation 1:\n\n3x + 5x = 80\n8x = 80\nx = 10\n\nNow that we have found x, we can find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales:\n\nLemonade sales = 6 (from Joe) + 10 (from Kamala) + 10 (from Alba) = 26\n\nTherefore, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.",
