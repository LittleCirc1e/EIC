        "output_str": "\nThe final cost of the dress would be $50 x 0.70 = $35.\n\nExplanation:\nTo find the final cost of the dress, we need to calculate the discount first. The store is offering 30% off of everything in the store, which means we need to calculate 30% of the original price of the dress. In this case, the original price of the dress is $50, so we multiply it by 0.70 to get the discount amount: $50 x 0.70 = $35. Therefore, the final cost of the dress is $35.",
