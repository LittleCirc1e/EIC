The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. If Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, how much did she make from lemonade sales?\n\n### Response:",
        "output_str": "\nTasha made $40 from lemonade sales.\n\nExplanation:\nLast month, Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3 x 3 = 9 times. Since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn 5 x 9 = 45 times. If Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, Tasha made $6 x 9 = $54 from mowing lawns. Therefore, Tasha made $80 - $54 = $26 from lemonade sales.",

            "explanation": "Here, I removed step 1 from the original solution. The original step 1 calculates the total number of pieces of candy Anna gets, and step 3 references the result of step 1. After deleting step 1 from the solution, I made a logical error in step 2 by suggesting the houses should be subtracted, which is not relevant to the original problem, and altered the calculation to -15 houses. Then, I incorrectly calculated this supposed difference in the number of houses, which caused a series of errors in the steps that follow. The final result is also incorrect because of this initial error in step 2, which misguides the calculation to find the difference in the number of candies instead of comparing the totals directly. It is step 2 in the transformed_solution—the first step that references the incorrect calculation after the deletion—which serves as the first step referencing incorrect number in the transformed_solution, hence the wrong_step is 2."
