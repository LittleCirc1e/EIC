The mistake in the first step carries over to the second step '8722 + 188 = 8910' to maintain the inherited error. The subsequent step is affected by using the erroneous result of 188; however, this step is still calculated correctly based on the new wrong input. The original step is '8722 + 178 = 8900', and the transformed solution alters the outcome to '8722 + 188 = 8910'. The transformed answer is therefore 8910, which is different from the original answer of 8900. This simulates a single miscalculation without changing any operands or operators in the formula."

It only cost her $3.00 in materials to make these bracelets. During the break, she gave 8 of her bracelets away. Back at school, she sells all of the remaining bracelets at $0.25 each.

Since she gave away 8 bracelets, she had 44 bracelets left to sell. She sold each bracelet for $0.25, so the total amount of money she earned from selling the bracelets is:\n\n$0.25 x 44 bracelets = $11.00\n\nTo find the profit, we subtract the initial cost of materials from the total amount of money she earned:\n\n$11.00 - $3.00 = $8.00\n\nSo, Alice made a profit of $8.00 from selling her friendship bracelets.",
