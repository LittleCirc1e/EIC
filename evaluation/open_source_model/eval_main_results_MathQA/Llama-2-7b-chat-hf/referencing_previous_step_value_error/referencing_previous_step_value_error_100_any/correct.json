Furthermore, the language description of step 5 has also changed from <The weight of dry grapes in 20 kgs of raisins is 20 - 5 = 15 kgs> to <The weight of dry grapes in 20 kgs of raisins is 20 - 6 = 14 kgs>. Step 5 affects the subsequent step 6 and 7 related to it. Step 6 changes from 0.15x = 15 to 0.15x = 14 and step 7 changes from x = 15 / 0.15 to x = 14 / 0.15.

        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #. The solution is incorrect because it assumes that the weight of dry grapes in 20 kgs of raisins is 14 kgs, which is not correct. The weight of dry grapes in 20 kgs of raisins is actually 10 kgs, not 14 kgs. Therefore, the weight of fresh grapes needed to get 20 kgs of raisins is not 93.33 kgs, but rather 100 kgs."
