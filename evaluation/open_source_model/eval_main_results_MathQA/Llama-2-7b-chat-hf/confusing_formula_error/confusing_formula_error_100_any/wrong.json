        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the formula for surface area and volume of a cuboid. The question asks for the surface area, requiring the use of the formula 2*(l*w + w*h + h*l), but the transformed solution incorrectly uses the volume formula (l*w*h). The language description of step 1 < The surface area of the cuboid is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. However, the calculation changes to reflect volume instead, which affects the answer in the transformed_solution. In this example, only step 1 mistakes the formula for the cuboid surface area, while the other steps, including the language used and calculations, correctly calculate volume based on the revised step 1.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. The explanation is that the volume of the cuboid is indeed 2b^3, as the dimensions of the cuboid formed by joining the two cubes are 2b, b, and b. Therefore, the surface area of the cuboid is 2b^2, which is the area of the two rectangular faces that meet at the corners of the cuboid."
