        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the perimeter and area formulas of a square. The question asks for solving the area, but instead of dividing the perimeter by the number of sides to find the side length, the solution incorrectly adds the number of sides to the perimeter, resulting in 48/4 = 12 being changed to 48+4 = 52 in transformed_solution. This mistake alters the following step 4, which then incorrectly calculates the area using the incorrect side length, changing from 12^2 = 144 to 52^2 = 2704. The descriptions of the steps in the original_solution remain unchanged in the transformed_solution. The confusion of formula error only occurs in one step and does not impact correct formulas used in other steps. In this example, only step 3 is incorrect, while the other calculation processes remain consistent with how they were in the original_solution.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'calculation_error'. The explanation is that the formula for the area of a square is A = s^2, where s is the side length of the square, not the perimeter. The perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length, so the perimeter of the square in this problem is 4s, not 48. Therefore, the area of the square is A = s^2 = (4s)^2 = 16s^2, not 2704 square meters."
