This affects the following steps since the total rainfall is now incorrectly set to 18 cm instead of 21 cm. Consequently, the calculation is based on the wrong total, which also changes the final answer for Tuesday’s rainfall from 10.5 cm to 9 cm.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #18.\n\nExplanation: The solution is incorrect because it assumes that the total rainfall for the week is 6 times the rainfall on Tuesday, which is not the case. The correct calculation is: Total rainfall for the week = 3 cm (average rainfall for the whole week) + rainfall on Tuesday = 3 + 9 = 12 cm. Therefore, it rained 12 cm on Tuesday."

        "question": "John had a stock of 620 books in his bookshop. He sold 50 on Monday, 82 on Tuesday, 60 on Wednesday, 48 on Thursday, and 40 on Friday. What percentage of the books were not sold?",
        "original_solution": "The total number of books sold is 50 + 82 + 60 + 48 + 40 = 280 books\nThe number of books not sold is 620 - 280 = 340 books\nThe percentage of books not sold is (340 / 620) * 100 = 54.84%\n#### 54.84%",

        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, there was a counting error introduced in the calculation of the percentage. The division by the number of days (which was 5 in reality but mistakenly counted as 4) is not relevant for the calculation of the percentage of books not sold. The incorrect transformation changed the calculation from a correct percentage to an incorrect value by dividing the percentage of books not sold by 4, which is unrelated to the number of days books were sold.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #, which is your answer after correction, and the explanation is #, which is your explanation about how to get the correct answer.\n\nThe solution is incorrect because the number of days is not 4, but 5. So, the total number of books sold is 50 + 82 + 60 + 48 + 40 = 280 books. The number of books not sold is 620 - 280 = 340 books. Therefore, the percentage of books not sold is (340 / 620) * 100 = 54.69%."
