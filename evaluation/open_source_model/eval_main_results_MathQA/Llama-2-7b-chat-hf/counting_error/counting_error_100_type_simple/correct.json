        "question": "How to resolve this question: second saturday and every sunday is a holiday. How many working days will be there in a month of 30 days beginning on a Saturday?",
        "original_solution": "In a month of 30 days, there will be 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays\nThe second Saturday and every Sunday are holidays, so there will be 2 Saturdays and 4 Sundays off\nTherefore, the total number of working days will be 30 - 2(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 24 days\n#### 24",
        "original_answer": 24,
        "transformed_solution": "In a month of 30 days, there will be 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays\nThe second Saturday and every Sunday are holidays, so there will be 3 Saturdays and 4 Sundays off\nTherefore, the total number of working days will be 30 - 3(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 23 days\n#### 23",
        "transformed_answer": 23,
        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 incorrectly increases the number of Saturdays off from 2 to 3. The wrong step caused an overcounting error in the number of holidays (Saturdays off), and it further impacts the calculation in step 3, changing it from 30 - 2(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 24 to 30 - 3(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 23. This is the step where the counting error is made, and the other steps remain correctly calculated based on the progression of the transformed_solution, leading to a transformed_answer of 23 days which differs from the original_answer.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'counting_error'. The explanation is that the calculation of the number of working days in a month of 30 days is correct, but the counting of the number of Saturdays and Sundays is incorrect. There are 5 Saturdays and 4 Sundays in a month of 30 days, not 3 and 4 as stated in the solution."
