If the station is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, how many cars does Gary's station serve over the course of a typical week?",
        "original_solution": "On Monday through Friday the station is open for 16 hours per day, that is 16 * 5 = 80 hours in total\nThe total number of cars served on Monday through Friday is 9 * 80 = 720 cars\nOn Saturday, the station is open for 16 hours and serves 15 cars per hour, so 16 * 15 = 240 cars\nOn Sunday, the station is open for 16 hours and serves 10 cars per hour, so 16 * 10 = 160 cars\nThe total number of cars served in one week is 720 + 240 + 160 = 1120 cars\n#### 1120",
        "original_answer": 1120,
        "transformed_solution": "On Monday through Friday the station is open for 16 hours per day, that is 16 * 4 = 64 hours in total\nThe total number of cars served on Monday through Friday is 9 * 64 = 576 cars\nOn Saturday, the station is open for 16 hours and serves 15 cars per hour, so 16 * 15 = 240 cars\nOn Sunday, the station is open for 16 hours and serves 10 cars per hour, so 16 * 10 = 160 cars\nThe total number of cars served in one week is 576 + 240 + 160 = 976 cars\n#### 976",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 mistakenly counts Monday through Friday as 4 days instead of 5 days, which changes the calculation from 16 * 5 = 80 to 16 * 4 = 64. This error propagates to the next step, changing the total number of cars served on Monday through Friday from 9 * 80 = 720 cars to 9 * 64 = 576 cars. The final total is then affected, changing from 720 + 240 + 160 = 1120 cars to 576 + 240 + 160 = 976 cars. This counting mistake only affected these steps, while the calculations for Saturday and Sunday remain correct.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. The explanation is that the total number of cars served in one week can be calculated by multiplying the number of hours the station is open per day by the number of cars served per hour. In this case, the station is open for 976 hours in a typical week, and it serves 9 cars per hour on all other days, so the total number of cars served is 976 * 9 = 894 cars."
