The division should be based on the total stock of books instead of the total number sold. The later part of the formula should remain the same, (number of books not sold / total number of books) * 100, but here the error has changed it to (number of books not sold / total number of books sold) * 100.",

The calculation (number of books not sold / total number of books sold) * 100 is incorrect because it is not divided by the total number of books sold, but by the number of books sold on each day. To find the percentage of books not sold, we need to calculate the ratio of the number of books not sold to the total number of books sold for each day, and then add them up. For example, on Monday, the number of books not sold is 700 - 50 = 650, and the percentage of books not sold is (650 / 700) * 100 = 91.43%. Similarly, for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, the number of books not sold is 700 - 82 = 618, 700 - 60 = 640, 700 - 48 = 652, and 700 - 40 = 660, and the percentage of books not sold is (618 / 700) * 100 = 86.14%, (640 / 700) * 100 = 90%, (652 / 700) * 100 = 92.86%, and (660 / 700) * 100 = 93.75%. Therefore, the percentage of books not sold is the sum of these daily percentages, which is 91.43% + 86.14% + 90% + 92.86% + 93.75% = 460.19%."

        "question": "on sunday , bill ran 4 more miles than he ran on saturday . julia did not run on saturday , but she ran twice the number of miles on sunday that bill ran on sunday . if bill and julia ran a total of 20 miles on saturday and sunday , how many miles did bill run on sunday ?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the number of miles bill ran on Saturday\nOn Sunday, Bill ran x + 4 miles\nJulia ran 2*(x+4) = 2x + 8 miles on Sunday\nThe total number of miles ran on Saturday and Sunday is x + (x+4) + (2x+8) = 20\nCombining like terms, 4x + 12 = 20\nSubtracting 12 from both sides gives 4x = 8\nDividing both sides by 4 gives x = 2\nSo, Bill ran x + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6 miles on Sunday\n#### 6",

        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the number of miles bill ran on Saturday\nOn Sunday, Bill ran x + 4 miles\nJulia ran 2*(x+4) = 2x + 8 miles on Sunday\nThe total number of miles ran on Saturday and Sunday is x + (x+4) + (2x+8) = 20\nCombining like terms, 4x + 12 = 20\nSubtracting 12 from both sides gives 4x = 8\nDividing both sides by 2 gives x = 4\nSo, Bill ran x + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8 miles on Sunday\n#### 8",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, a single arithmetic error is introduced in step 7 of the original_solution with the incorrect division by 2, giving x = 4. This error wrongly changes the conclusion that Bill ran 6 miles on Sunday to claiming he ran 8 miles on Sunday in the transformed_solution.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #. The solution states that Bill ran 8 miles on Sunday, but the correct answer is 4 miles. The explanation is as follows:\n\nOn Sunday, Bill ran x + 4 miles, where x is the number of miles he ran on Saturday. Since Julia ran twice the number of miles that Bill ran on Sunday, Julia ran 2x + 8 miles on Sunday. The total number of miles ran on Saturday and Sunday is x + (x + 4) + (2x + 8) = 20. Combining like terms, 4x + 12 = 20, subtracting 12 from both sides gives 4x = 8, and dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 4. Therefore, Bill ran 4 miles on Sunday."

        "question": "At Chennai it rained as much on Tuesday as on all the others days of the week combined. If the average rainfall for the whole week was 3cm. How much did it rain on Tuesday?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the amount of rain on Tuesday\nTotal rainfall for the week = 7 * 3 = 21 cm\nTotal rainfall for Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday = 21 - x\nSince it rained as much on Tuesday as on all the others days combined: x = 21 - x\n2x = 21\nx = 10.5\n#### 10.5",
        "original_answer": 10.5,
        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the amount of rain on Tuesday\nTotal rainfall for the week = 6 * 3 = 18 cm\nTotal rainfall for Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday = 18 - x\nSince it rained as much on Tuesday as on all the others days combined: x = 18 - x\n2x = 18\nx = 9\n#### 9",

        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In step 2 of the original_solution, the total days are erroneously counted as 6 instead of 7 when calculating the total rainfall for the week. This affects the following steps since the total rainfall is now incorrectly set to 18 cm instead of 21 cm. Consequently, the calculation is based on the wrong total, which also changes the final answer for Tuesday’s rainfall from 10.5 cm to 9 cm.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #. The solution is incorrect because it assumes that the total rainfall for the week is 6 times the rainfall on Tuesday, which is not the case. The correct calculation is: Total rainfall for the week = 3 cm (average rainfall for the week) + rainfall on Tuesday. Therefore, the amount of rain that fell on Tuesday is 3 cm."

        "original_solution": "The total number of books sold is 50 + 82 + 60 + 48 + 40 = 280 books\nThe number of books not sold is 620 - 280 = 340 books\nThe percentage of books not sold is (340 / 620) * 100 = 54.84%\n#### 54.84%",

        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, there was a counting error introduced in the calculation of the percentage. The division by the number of days (which was 5 in reality but mistakenly counted as 4) is not relevant for the calculation of the percentage of books not sold. The incorrect transformation changed the calculation from a correct percentage to an incorrect value by dividing the percentage of books not sold by 4, which is unrelated to the number of days books were sold.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #. The number of books not sold is actually 340 books, not 340 / 620 * 100 / 4 = 13.71%. This is because the number of books sold in 4 days is 280, not 620. Therefore, the percentage of books not sold is (340 / 620) * 100 = 54.69%."
