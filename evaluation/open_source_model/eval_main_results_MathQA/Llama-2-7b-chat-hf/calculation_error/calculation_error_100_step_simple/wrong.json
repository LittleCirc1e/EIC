        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, the calculation of 500 x 1609.34 has been incorrectly modified to result in an incorrect value of 800000 meters instead of the correct value of 804670 meters. The previous step is not affected since it simply establishes the conversion rate without any calculations. The transformation introduces a single error in step 2, which only changes the outcome of that specific step and the final answer, without altering the logic or the methodology of the original solution.",
