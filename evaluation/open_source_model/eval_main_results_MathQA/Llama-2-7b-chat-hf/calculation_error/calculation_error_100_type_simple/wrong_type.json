        "explanation": "The mistake is introduced at step 2 of the original solution by changing the result of 36 / 0.45 from 80 to 70. This single calculation error modifies the outcome while keeping the formula intact. Subsequent steps inherit this wrong calculation, leading to a total amount of the sum calculation of 70 * 1.75 = Rs 122.50, which is incorrect. The formula itself remains the same, but the numbers are changed due to the inherited error from the first wrong step, resulting in Rs 122.50 instead of the correct Rs 140.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'unit_conversion_error'. The formula in the first wrong step contains unit conversion error, as 100 paisa is equal to 1 rupee, not 100 paisa. Therefore, the total amount of the sum is 100 + 45 + 30 = 175 rupees, not 175 paisa or Rs 122.50. The correct answer is #175."
