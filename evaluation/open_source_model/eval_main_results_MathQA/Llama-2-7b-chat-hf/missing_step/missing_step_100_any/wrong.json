However, the number 0.007 was incorrectly subtracted by the value 0.005 - instead of subtracting the expression (0.005*(1-y)), leading to the incorrect solution. Steps 5, 6, and 7, as subsequent related steps, are affected by this wrong calculation. Step 5 will change 0.008y - 0.005y = 0.007 - 0.005 to 0.008y = 0.007 - 0.005, step 6 will change 0.003y = 0.002 to 0.008y = 0.002, and step 7 will change y = 0.002 / 0.003 to y = 0.002 / 0.008. It is step 3 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 4 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing incorrect numbers in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 3.",

The solution uses the correct equation to solve for y, and the explanation provides a clear and concise reason why the solution is correct. The solution correctly accounts for the defective rate of both worker x and worker y, and it correctly calculates the fraction of products checked by worker y. Therefore, the answer is #1/4."

Steps 2 references the result of step 1, so after deleting step 1, step 2 should refer directly to the number in the question which is 50 (the largest between 0 and 100). Therefore, the formula in step 2 remains unaltered. Since the initial calculation of the average has been removed, it also necessitates a change in steps at the end of the solution. Instead of comparing averages directly, the transformed solution compares the sums and then calculates the difference in averages based on the total count of even numbers in each range. It should be noted that this approach assumes understanding that the average can also be calculated by dividing the sum by the count. It is step 1 in the original_solution that is now missing, making the first step incorrect in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 1.",
