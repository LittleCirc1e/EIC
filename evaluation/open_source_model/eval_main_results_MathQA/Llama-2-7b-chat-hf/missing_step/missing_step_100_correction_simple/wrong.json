        "explanation": "In this example, the intermediate step 'Divide both sides by 40: x = (200/3*1)/40y' has been removed. Because the subsequent related step 'x = 5/3y' was originally referring to the result of the removed step, the subsequent steps need to refer to the result of the previous step 'Multiply both sides by 100 to get rid of the decimal: 40x = 200/3y.' However, instead of correcting the process to reflect the impact of this deletion, a wrong manipulation has been performed by multiplying both sides by 3, leading to the incorrect transformed_solution 'x*3=5y.' Consequently, the previous step's result has been misused, and a new error has been introduced, leading to the incorrect conclusion that 'The ratio of the first number to the second number is 3:5' instead of the correct '5:3.' The wrong_step is 3 since it is the first step referencing the result of the deleted step and introducing the incorrect calculation.",

However, instead of simplifying this fraction to 2/25, an intentional error is introduced in the simplification process that results in an incorrect fraction of 4/50. Since the transformation starts from the middle of the original solution (skipping the explanation about dividing by 100), the wrong_step is 1.

In the original solution, steps 2 and 3 calculate the number of ways to choose 2 men and 2 women respectively, which do not depend on the total number of choices directly, so they are not changed. However, step 4, which calculates the total number of favorable outcomes, and step 5, which calculates the probability, do depend on the total number of outcomes. Thus step 4 remains unchanged, but in step 5, the direct calculation of the total outcomes using C(8,4) has been replaced with the expression it stands for, so the solution incorrectly tries to divide 36 by the expression C(8,4) rather than its result, 70.

The original step involves multiplying 15 small boxes by 25 chocolate bars per box, which is correct and gives 375 chocolate bars. However, in the transformed solution, we retain the multiplication of the numbers but mistakenly keep only one factor of 25, instead of multiplying it by 15 to get the total. This results in an incorrect number of chocolate bars (25 instead of 375). The erroneous result is carried on from the first step, making it the wrong_step.

Instead of comparing averages directly, the transformed solution compares the sums and then calculates the difference in averages based on the total count of even numbers in each range.
