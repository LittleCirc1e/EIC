        "explanation": "The transformed solution omits the original step 2 \"4x^2\" from the sum of the squares. Hence, the new equation becomes 9x^2 + 25x^2 = 34x^2, and as such, the rest of the steps must be recalculated based on this new equation. The wrong value is now propagated down through the calculation of x^2 which results in an incorrect value for x and consequently for 2x. The value now becomes the square root of (1862 / 34), which does not yield a perfect square as in the original solution. The final calculation multiplies the approximated value of the square root by 2 to get the middle number, creating a transformed answer that is different from the original. The wrong_step is identified as step 2 because that is the first step in the transformed_solution referencing an incorrect sum in the series.",
