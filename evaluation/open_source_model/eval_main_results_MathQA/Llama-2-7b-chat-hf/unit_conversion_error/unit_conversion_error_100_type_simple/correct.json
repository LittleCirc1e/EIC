Alice leaves city A 30 minutes after Bob. What is the minimum constant speed in miles per hour that Alice must exceed in order to arrive in city B before Bob?",
        "original_solution": "The time it takes Bob to get to city B is 30 miles / 40 miles per hour = 0.75 hours.\nAlice leaves 30 minutes after Bob, so she has 0.5 hours less time to get to city B than Bob.\nTo get to city B before Bob, Alice must drive 30 miles in 0.75 - 0.5 = 0.25 hours.\nTherefore, the minimum constant speed in miles per hour that Alice must exceed in order to arrive in city B before Bob is 30 miles / 0.25 hours = 120 miles per hour.\n#### 120",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 makes an incorrect unit conversion error by stating that Alice has 0.75 hours less time instead of 0.5 hours, due to incorrectly converting 30 minutes into 0.75 hours instead of the correct 0.5 hours. This error affects the subsequent steps, specifically steps 3 and 4, where the time Alice has to drive is calculated incorrectly as 0 hours (0.75 - 0.75), leading to an incorrect, undefined speed calculation since one cannot divide by zero.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'unit_conversion_error'. The formula in the first wrong step is correct, but the unit conversion is incorrect. The distance from city A to city B is in miles, and the speed of Bob is also in miles per hour, so the unit conversion should be miles / hours, not miles per hour. Therefore, the correct answer is 30 miles / 40 miles per hour = 0.75 hours."
