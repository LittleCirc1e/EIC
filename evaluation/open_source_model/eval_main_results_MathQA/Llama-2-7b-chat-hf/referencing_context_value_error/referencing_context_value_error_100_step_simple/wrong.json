Its subsequent related step will be affected, calculating 0.6x + 2.25x = 2.85x instead of 0.6x + 2.1x = 2.7x in step 4. The combined tax rate then calculates as 1 - (2.85x / 4x) = 0.2875 or 28.75% instead of 1 - (2.7x / 4x) = 0.325 or 32.5% in step 5.

Mindy paid 25% in taxes, so she kept 75% of her income. The total kept after taxes is 2.85x, and the combined tax rate is 1 - (2.85x / 4x) = 0.2875, which is 28.75%."
