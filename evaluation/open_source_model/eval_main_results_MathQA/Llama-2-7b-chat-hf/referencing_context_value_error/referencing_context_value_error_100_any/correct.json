The man's speed in still water is actually greater than the average of his speeds upstream and downstream. To determine the man's speed in still water, we need to use the equation:\n\nSpeed in still water = (Speed upstream + Speed downstream) / 2\n\nUsing the given data, we can plug in the values for speed upstream and downstream to get:\n\nSpeed in still water = (20 + 60) / 2 = 40 kmph\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 40 kmph."
