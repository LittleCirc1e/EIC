The explanation is that the perimeter of a rectangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides, and the length and breadth of the rectangle are given in the problem statement. Therefore, we can set up the equation 2(length + breadth) = 88, and solve for the length and breadth. The length is 3 times the breadth, so the length is 3x, and the breadth is x. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is length x breadth, which is 161.26 (approximately)."
