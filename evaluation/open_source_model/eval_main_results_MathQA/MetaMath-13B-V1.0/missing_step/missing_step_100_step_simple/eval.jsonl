The original step references the number 9.25 from the question and the division is performed accordingly to determine the cost price per meter. By changing the divisor from 9.25 to 9 (a number smaller than 9.25), the formula becomes 434.75 / 9, resulting in the incorrect transformed answer.

{"question": "There are 15 teams in a soccer league and each team plays each of the other teams once.

Therefore, the formula has been adjusted from 15 x (15-1) / 2 to 15 x 15 / 2, yielding an incorrect total of 112.5 games.
