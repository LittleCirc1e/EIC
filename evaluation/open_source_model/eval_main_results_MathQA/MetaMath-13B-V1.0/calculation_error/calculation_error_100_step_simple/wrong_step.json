        "question": "In a games hour 4 different types of players came to the ground - cricket 16, hockey 12, football 18, softball 13. How many players are present in the ground?",
        "original_solution": "The total number of players present is 16 + 12 + 18 + 13 = 59.\n#### 59",
        "original_answer": 59.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total number of players present is 16 + 12 + 18 + 10 = 56.\n#### 56",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example change the number of softball players from 13 to 10 in step 1 without justification, which impacts the total calculated in the same step. The remaining part of the solution inherits this error without other changes. All original operands and operators remain the same, and the only change is to the result of the addition, making the end result different from the original answer.",
        "eval_result": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the number of players present in the ground.\nLet's break down the information given:\nNumber of cricket players: 16\nNumber of hockey players: 12\nNumber of football players: 18\nNumber of softball players: 13\nTotal number of players: 56\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\nNumber of cricket players + Number of hockey players + Number of football players + Number of softball players = Total number of players\n16 + 12 + 18 + 13 = 56\nLet's simplify and solve for x:\n69 = 56\nThis equation is not true, which means there is an error in the given solution.\nTherefore, the given solution is incorrect, and we need to determine the first wrong step.\nThe first wrong step is step 4, as that is where the error occurs.\nThe explanation for the incorrect solution is: The solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 4, and the explanation is: 4\nThe value of x is 4.The answer is: 4"
