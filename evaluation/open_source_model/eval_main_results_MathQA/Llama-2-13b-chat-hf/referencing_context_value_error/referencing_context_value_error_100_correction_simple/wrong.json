The correct answer is 2:1, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nWhen we compare the surface areas of the two cubes, we need to consider the fact that the ratio of the sides of the cubes is 4:1. This means that the longer side of one cube has a length of 4 times the length of the shorter side of the other cube.\n\nLet's call the length of the shorter side of the first cube \"a\". Then, the length of the longer side of the first cube is 4a.\n\nThe surface area of the first cube is given by:\n\nSA = 6a^2 + 4a^2 = 10a^2\n\nSimilarly, the surface area of the second cube is given by:\n\nSA = 6(4a)^2 + 4(4a)^2 = 48a^2 + 16a^2 = 64a^2\n\nNow, we can see that the ratio of the surface areas of the two cubes is:\n\n64a^2 : 10a^2 = 8 : 1\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 2:1.\n\nNote that the solution provided in the original question is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the ratio of the sides of the cubes is 4:1."
