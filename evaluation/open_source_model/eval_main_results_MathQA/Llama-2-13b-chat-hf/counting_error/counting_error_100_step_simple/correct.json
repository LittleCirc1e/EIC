        "original_solution": "The total number of toys produced per week is 4340\nThe workers work 2 days a week\nSo, the total number of toys produced each day is 4340 / 2 = 2170\n#### 2170",
        "original_answer": 2170,
        "transformed_solution": "The total number of toys produced per week is 4340\nThe workers work 1 days a week\nSo, the total number of toys produced each day is 4340 / 1 = 4340\n#### 4340",

        "explanation": "In the transformed_solution, step 2 incorrectly counts the number of workdays as 1 instead of 2. This error changes the division in step 3 from 4340 / 2 = 2170 to 4340 / 1 = 4340. Please note that only this counting error should be considered and the subsequent step is calculated correctly based on the modified counting.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nPlease provide your response here.\n\nPlease note that the [Solution] is incorrect, and the first wrong step is step #2, which is the second line of the solution. The explanation is that the workers do not work 1 day a week, but 2 days a week, so the total number of toys produced each day should be half of the total number of toys produced per week, which is 4340 / 2 = 2170, not 4340. Therefore, the correct solution is:\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #2, and the explanation is that the workers work 2 days a week, not 1 day a week, so the total number of toys produced each day should be half of the total number of toys produced per week, which is 4340 / 2 = 2170, not 4340."

As a result, the calculation for the number of toys produced each day has been affected, changing from 5500 / 5 = 1100 to 5500 / 4 = 1375. This is a counting error as the working days have been undercounted. However, the division calculation itself is executed correctly.
