Julia ran twice the number of miles on Sunday that Bill ran on Sunday, so she ran 2(x + 6) = 2x + 12 miles on Sunday. The total number of miles ran on Saturday and Sunday is x + (x + 6) + (2x + 12) = 4x + 18, which is equal to 32 miles. Therefore, we can set up the equation 4x + 18 = 32, and solve for x.

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 incorrectly increases the number of Saturdays off from 2 to 3. The wrong step caused an overcounting error in the number of holidays (Saturdays off), and it further impacts the calculation in step 3, changing it from 30 - 2(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 24 to 30 - 3(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 23.

        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #3, which is your explanation about why the [Solution] is correct.\n\nIn the [Solution], the correct reasoning is demonstrated by breaking down the information given in the [Question] and using it to find the solution. First, the total number of miles ran on Saturday and Sunday is found to be 20 miles. Then, by using the information that Bill ran 4 more miles on Sunday than he ran on Saturday, the number of miles Bill ran on Sunday is found to be x + 4, where x is the number of miles Bill ran on Saturday. Additionally, Julia ran twice the number of miles on Sunday that Bill ran on Sunday, so Julia ran 2(x+4) = 2x + 8 miles on Sunday. By combining like terms, the equation 4x + 12 = 20 is obtained, which can be solved to find that x = 4. Therefore, Bill ran 4 + 4 = 8 miles on Sunday."
