        "question": "the length of a rectangular plot is 10 mtr more than its width . the cost of fencing the plot along its perimeter at the rate of rs . 6.5 mtr is rs . 910 . the perimeter of the plot is ?",
        "original_solution": "Let the width of the plot be x meters\nSo the length of the plot is x+10 meters\nThe perimeter of the plot is 2*(length + width) = 2*(x+10 + x) = 2*(2x + 10) = 4x + 20 meters\nThe cost of fencing the plot along its perimeter is given as 6.5 * (4x + 20) = 910\nSo, 4x + 20 = 910 / 6.5 = 140\n4x = 120\nx = 30\nSo, the perimeter of the plot is 4*30 + 20 = 120 + 20 = 140 meters\n#### 140",
        "original_answer": 140.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let the width of the plot be x meters\nSo the length of the plot is x+10 meters\nThe area of the plot is length * width = (x+10) * x = x^2 + 10x square meters\nThe cost of fencing the plot along its perimeter is given as 6.5 * (x^2 + 10x) = 910\nSo, x^2 + 10x = 910 / 6.5\nThis creates a quadratic equation, however, this is not the correct formula for perimeter\n#### This step is incorrect, yielding an incorrect solution",
        "transformed_answer": "This step is incorrect, yielding an incorrect solution",
        "wrong_step": 3,
        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the formula for the perimeter with the formula for the area of the rectangle. The question requires computing the perimeter of the rectangle to be equal to two times the sum of the length and the width, rather than the length multiplied by width, which is equivalent to the area of the rectangle. The original solution correctly uses the formula for perimeter, but in the transformed solution, the area formula replaces the perimeter formula resulting in a value that doesn't represent the perimeter at all. The equation for the cost of fencing then mistakenly uses this area in place of the perimeter. This error affects the calculation and makes it impossible to correctly find the value for x, and therefore the actual perimeter of the plot.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'confusing_formula_error', and the explanation is: The first wrong step is the third step, where the formula for the area of the plot is incorrect. The formula should be the area of a rectangle = length x width, not the area of a square = length^2. This mistake leads to an incorrect solution. The correct solution is: The perimeter of the plot is 2(length + width) = 2(x + 10) = 2x + 20 meters."
