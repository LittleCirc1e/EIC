The correct formula to calculate the area of a rectangle is A = L x W, where L and W are the length and width of the rectangle, respectively.\n\nIn this case, we know that the area of the square carpet is 169 m², and each side of the square carpet is 13 m. Therefore, the length and width of the rectangular room must be 13 m and 13 m, respectively. The area of the rectangular room is A = L x W = 13 x 13 = 169 m².\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 169 m², not 48 m²."
