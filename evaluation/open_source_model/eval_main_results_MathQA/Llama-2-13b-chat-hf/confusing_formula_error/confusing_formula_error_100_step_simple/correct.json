        "explanation": "Here, step 4 confuses the volume and surface area of the wall. The question requires that the volume of the wall be solved by multiplying its dimensions: width, height, and length, resulting in x * 6x * 42x for the volume. However, the formula for surface area, 2 * (length + width + height), is used instead, changing the volume formula from x * 6x * 42x to 2 * (x + 6x + 42x). This affects the subsequent steps. Step 5 changes from 6x * 42x * x = 16128 to 2 * (x + 6x + 42x) = 16128, and step 6 from 252x^3 = 16128 to 98x = 16128, resulting in a mistake in the value of x and a wrong transformed answer of 164.98 instead of the original 4. Note that the language description prior to the incorrect formula remains unchanged in the transformed_solution.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #4, which is an integer, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nIn step #4, the formula for the volume of the wall is incorrect. The correct formula is V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. In this case, the length of the wall is given as 7 times the height, so the correct formula for the volume would be V = 7hwh.\n\nUsing the given values, we have:\n\nV = 7(6x)wh = 7(6x) * 6x * 1 = 7(6x)^2 * 1 = 42x^2\n\nTherefore, the correct answer for the width of the wall is 164.98, not 161.28."
