        "question": "a larger cube has 8 cubic inch as a volume and in the cube there are 8 smaller cubes such that their volume is 1 cubic inch. What is the difference between the surface areas’ sum of the 8 smaller cubes and the surface area of the larger cube, in square inch?",
        "original_solution": "The side length of the larger cube is 2 inches (cubic root of 8).\nThe surface area of the larger cube is 6*2*2=24 square inches.\nThe side length of the smaller cube is 1 inch (cubic root of 1).\nThe surface area of one smaller cube is 6*1*1=6 square inches.\nThe sum of the surface areas of the 8 smaller cubes is 8*6=48 square inches.\nThe difference between the surface areas’ sum of the 8 smaller cubes and the surface area of the larger cube is 48-24=24 square inches.\n#### 24",
        "original_answer": 24.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The side length of the larger cube is 2 inches (cubic root of 8).\nThe volume of the larger cube is 2*2*2=8 cubic inches.\nThe side length of the smaller cube is 1 inch (cubic root of 1).\nThe surface area of one smaller cube is 1+1+1+1+1+1=6 square inches.\nThe sum of the surface areas of the 8 smaller cubes is 8*6=48 square inches.\nThe difference between the surface areas’ sum of the 8 smaller cubes and the volume of the larger cube is 48-8=40 square inches.\n#### 40",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 4 confuses the surface area and the edge length of the cube. The question requires that the surface area of the cube to be solved be equal to 6 times the square of the side length, but step 4 uses the edge length sum formula, which is equivalent to the sum of all edges, resulting in 6*1*1=6 in the original_solution being changed to 1+1+1+1+1+1=6 in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent related step 5, which calculates the sum of the surface areas of the 8 smaller cubes correctly but creates an incorrect understanding that the result should be compared with the volume of the larger cube in step 6. Note that the language description of step 4 < The surface area of one smaller cube is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. The transformation is made without modifying any words in the language description and ensures the correct use of formulas in other steps. Furthermore, the transformed_answer is different from the original_answer.",

        "question": "The ratio between the perimeter and the width of a rectangle is 5 : 1 . if the area of the rectangle is 150 sq . cm , what is the width of the rectangle ?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the width of the rectangle.\nThen the length of the rectangle is 150/x.\nAccording to the given ratio, 2(150/x + x) = 5x.\nSolving this equation, we get x = 10.\n#### 10",
        "original_answer": 10.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the width of the rectangle.\nThen the length of the rectangle is 150+x.\nAccording to the given ratio, 2(150+x + x) = 5x.\nSolving this equation, we do not get a proper value for x as this equation becomes invalid.\n#### -1",

        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In step 2 of the transformed_solution, the area of the rectangle formula has been confused with the perimeter formula. Instead of calculating the length as 150/x, which is using the correct area formula (area = width * length), the transformed_solution incorrectly uses the sum of length and width (150 + x) which does not correctly calculate the length based on the given area and leads to a meaningless equation when trying to apply the ratio of perimeter to width, 2(150+x + x) = 5x. This mistake affects the equality and the calculation of x, leading to an incorrect transformed_answer. The explanation does not include the thinking process or step-by-step generation but simply describes the specific formula confusion error and its consequence on the outcome.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #3, which must be an integer, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nIn step #3, the equation 2(150+x + x) = 5x is not valid because the expression 150+x + x is not a constant value, it is a variable value, so we cannot equate it with a constant value 5x. The correct equation should be 2(150+x) + 2x = 5x, which is a valid equation.\n\nTherefore, the correct width of the rectangle is 30 cm."
