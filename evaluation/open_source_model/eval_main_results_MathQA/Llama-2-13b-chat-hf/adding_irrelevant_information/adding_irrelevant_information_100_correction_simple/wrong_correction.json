        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #80, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nIn the first step, the price after a 15% decrease is calculated as 100 - (0.15 * 100) = 100 - 15 = $85. However, there is a mistake in this step, as the discount of 15% should be applied to $100, not to $85. Therefore, the correct price after the first discount should be $80, not $85.\n\nThe rest of the solution is correct, and the net change in the price is $88.825 - $100 = -$11.175. Therefore, the final answer is $80."
