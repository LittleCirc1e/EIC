To find the percentage decrease in area, we need to calculate the percentage decrease in length and breadth separately and then add them up.\n\nThe percentage decrease in length is 20% of 100% = 20%.\nThe percentage decrease in breadth is 20% of 100% = 20%.\n\nThe total percentage decrease in area is the sum of the percentage decrease in length and breadth:\n20% + 20% = 40%.\n\nTherefore, the percentage decrease in area is 40%."
