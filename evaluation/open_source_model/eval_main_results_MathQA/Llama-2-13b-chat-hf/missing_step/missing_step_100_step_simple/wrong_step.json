        "explanation": "The transformation removes the first step which includes the formula for the area. The original step 2 references the result of step 1, which is the area formula. Without that step, the problem incorrectly applies the diagonal lengths directly without multiplying by (1/2) to find the area. The transformed_solution reflects direct multiplication without the division by 2 step, which indicates a miscalculation of the area. The first and only step in the transformed_solution also represents the first step that references an incorrect application of the formula, therefore the wrong_step is 1.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #2, which must be an integer, and the explanation is: The area of a rhombus is not calculated by multiplying the lengths of its diagonals. The correct formula for the area of a rhombus is A = (side^2 + side^2) / 2, where side is the length of one side of the rhombus. In this case, the length of one side of the rhombus is half the length of the diagonals, which is half of 14 cm and half of 20 cm, respectively. Therefore, the area of the rhombus is (half of 14)^2 + (half of 20)^2 / 2 = 98 + 160 / 2 = 126.5 square cm.\n\nPlease note that the final answer is 126.5 square cm, not 280."
