        "original_solution": "The loss is 1500 - 1290 = 210\nThe loss percentage is (210/1500) * 100 = 14%\n#### 14",
        "original_answer": 14.0,

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 2 mistakenly references 1500 as 1400 from step 1 and changes the loss percentage calculation from (210/1500) * 100 to (210/1400) * 100. It should be noted that step 1 in the transformed_solution <The loss is 1500 - 1290 = 210> should be the same as the step 1 in the original_solution <The loss is 1500 - 1290 = 210> and calculates its result 210 correctly. Step 2 affects only the subsequent calculation related to it, changing the original loss percentage from 14% to 15%. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all steps is still correct.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 18%, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nIn the solution, the loss is calculated as 210, which is correct. However, the loss percentage is calculated as (210/1400) * 100, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should be (210/1500) * 100, which gives us an loss percentage of 18%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 18%, and the root cause of the mistake is the incorrect calculation of the loss percentage in step #3."
