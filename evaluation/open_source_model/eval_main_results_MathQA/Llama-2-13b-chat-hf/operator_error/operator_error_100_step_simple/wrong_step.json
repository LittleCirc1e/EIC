        "explanation": "The change occurred in step 7 where the subtraction operator (-) was changed to an addition operator (+). Originally, 1000 - 100 + 0.025x - 0.05x = 600, was transformed to 1000 + 100 + 0.025x + 0.05x = 600. This led to the altered equation 0.025x + 0.05x = 600 - 1100, which distorted the final calculation into an incorrect total sales worth (x). The operator in step 7 is incorrect, and accordingly, its calculation is also incorrect, which directly affects the final result, leading to an incorrect transformed solution. All other calculations derived from this error were correctly performed based on the modified values.",

The correct equation should be 1000 + 0.025x + 0.05x = 600, since the commission is calculated based on the total sales worth x, not the excess sales over Rs. 4000.\n\nTherefore, the correct solution is:\n\nLet x be the total sales worth\nPrevious remuneration = 0.05x\nNew remuneration = 1000 + 0.025x\nNew remuneration - Previous remuneration = 600\n1000 + 0.025x + 0.05x = 600\n0.075x = 600 - 1100\nx = -555.56.\n\n#### -555.56."
