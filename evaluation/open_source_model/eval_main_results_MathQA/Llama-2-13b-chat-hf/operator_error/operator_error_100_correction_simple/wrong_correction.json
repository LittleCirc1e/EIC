        "question": "The consumption of diesel per hour of a bus varies directly as square of its speed. When the bus is travelling at 70 kmph its consumption is 1 litre per hour. If each litre costs $70 and other expenses per hour is $70, then what would be the minimum expenditure required to cover a distance of 700 km?",
        "original_solution": "The consumption of diesel per hour varies directly as the square of the speed, so the consumption at 70 kmph is 1 litre per hour.\nIf each litre costs $70, the fuel cost at 70 kmph is 1 x $70 = $70 per hour.\nThe other expenses per hour are $70.\nTotal expenses per hour at 70 kmph are $70 for fuel + $70 for other expenses = $140.\nIt takes 10 hours to cover 700 km at 70 kmph because 700 / 70 = 10\nThe minimum expenditure required to cover a distance of 700 km is 10 x $140 = $1400.\n#### 1400",
        "original_answer": 1400.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The consumption of diesel per hour varies directly as the square of the speed, so the consumption at 70 kmph is 1 litre per hour.\nIf each litre costs $70, the fuel cost at 70 kmph is 1 x $70 = $70 per hour.\nThe other expenses per hour are $70.\nTotal expenses per hour at 70 kmph are $70 for fuel + $70 for other expenses = $140.\nIt takes 700 * 70 = 49000 hours to cover 700 km at 70 kmph because of an incorrect operation change.\nThe minimum expenditure required to cover a distance of 700 km is 49000 x $140 = $6860000.\n#### 6860000",

        "wrong_step": 5,
        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, an operator was incorrectly changed from division to multiplication in step 5. This led to an incorrect total time to cover 700 km at 70 kmph. The error was applied by changing the correct operation 700 / 70 = 10 to an incorrect 700 * 70 = 49000. All other steps have been correctly calculated based on the incorrect outcome of the wrong step, resulting in an erroneous total expense of $6860000 instead of the correct $1400.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #49000, which is the total hours required to cover 700 km at 70 kmph. The explanation is that the calculation of total expenses per hour at 70 kmph is incorrect, the correct calculation is $70 for fuel + $70 for other expenses = $140 per hour, not $140000 per hour as stated in the solution. Therefore, the minimum expenditure required to cover a distance of 700 km is 49000 x $140 = $686000, not $68600000 as stated in the solution."
