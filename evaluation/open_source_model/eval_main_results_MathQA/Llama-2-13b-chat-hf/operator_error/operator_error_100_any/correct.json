Therefore, the expression (3 ø 1) ø 2 is not well-defined.\n\nIn order to make the expression well-defined, we need to restrict the domain of the operation ø to only positive integers.

This results in an impossible count of boys, calculated in step 2 as 160 - 320 = -160, which is not a feasible number of students. The original count was 80 boys, so the transformation caused by the operator error in step 1 led to a nonsensical answer.
