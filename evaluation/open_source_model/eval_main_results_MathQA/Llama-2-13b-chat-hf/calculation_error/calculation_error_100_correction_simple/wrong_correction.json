        "explanation": "In this example, the calculation 1100 x 0.32 is incorrectly transformed to 350 in step 3 instead of the correct calculation, which is 352. The mistake is made without changing any operands or operators in the formula. Subsequently, related steps 4, 5, and 6 inherit the mistake, and the numbers in the formulas inherit the error from step 3. Step 4 is modified to 288 + 350 = 638, step 5 to 2000 - 638 = 1362, and step 6 to (1362 / 2000) x 100 = 68.1%. This results in a transformed answer of 68.1%, which is different from the original answer.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 68.0%, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nIn the solution, the number of boys passed is calculated as 1100 x 32% = 350, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should be 1100 x 32% = 352.\n\nTherefore, the total number of candidates passed should be 288 + 352 = 640, not 638.\n\nThe total number of candidates failed should be 2000 - 640 = 1360, not 1362.\n\nThe percentage of failed candidates should be (1360 / 2000) x 100 = 68.0%, not 68.1%."
