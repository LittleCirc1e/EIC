This intentional error only affects the outcome of the last step, not the accuracy of any prior steps or calculations. The prior steps correctly determine the speed of the train and the total distance to be crossed, but the final time calculation (transformed solution) has been deliberately made incorrect to differ from the original answer.",

The change made to the second step does not have any impact on the calculations of the prior step. The calculation error in transformed_solution is present only in step 2 where the result of dividing 1040 by 20 is mistakenly said to be 50, the actual division carries the correct answer of 52.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'calculation_error', and the explanation is: The formula for the number of days required by 20 men to do the work is incorrect. The correct formula is 20 x 80 = 1600 days, not 1040 days. Therefore, the answer should be 1600 / 20 = 80 days, not 50 days."
