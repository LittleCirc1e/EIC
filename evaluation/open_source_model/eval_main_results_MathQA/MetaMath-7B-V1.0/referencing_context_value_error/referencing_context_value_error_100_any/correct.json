Please note that you should only consider one error, so the erroneous result from this step is used to calculate the transformed answer, which leads to it being different from the original answer.",
        "eval_result": "To determine if the solution is correct, we need to solve the equation 0.75 * 8 / 5 = 1.20.\nLet's simplify the equation:\n0.75 * 8 / 5 = 1.20\n5.8 / 5 = 1.20\n1.16 = 1.20\nSince 1.16 is not equal to 1.20, the solution is incorrect.\nTherefore, the correct solution is:\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #.The answer is: 1.2"
