        "explanation": "Step 1 mistakenly calculates the power 1.003^4 as 1.009 instead of 1.012. This is a calculation error, as the power was incorrectly calculated. The exponentiation should be computed correctly using proper arithmetic to ensure accuracy. As 1.003 raised to the power of 4 more accurately equals 1.012015, when rounded to 3 decimal places the result should be 1.012. The step has been intentionally modified to introduce a single wrong calculation.",
        "eval_result": "To determine if the solution is correct, we need to calculate the value of 1.003^4 and see if it matches the given answer of 1.009.\nLet's calculate 1.003^4:\n1.003^4 = 1.003 * 1.003 * 1.003 * 1.003\n       = 1.0030003\n\nThe calculated value is 1.0030003, which is not equal to 1.009. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.\n\nThe first wrong step is step 4. The explanation is: The solution is incorrect, and the first wrong step is step 4.The answer is: 4"
