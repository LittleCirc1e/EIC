        "original_solution": "It takes her 6 days to complete 1 work because 6 x 1 = 6\nIt takes her 18 days to complete 3 works because 6 x 3 = 18\n#### 18",
        "original_answer": 18.0,
        "transformed_solution": "It takes her 6 days to complete 1 work because 6 x 1 = 6\nIt takes her 24 days to complete 3 works because 6 x 3 = 24\n#### 24",

        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates 6 x 3 as 24 instead of 6 x 3 = 18 in step 2. The first step, which involves calculating the time it takes for 1 work, remains unchanged. The erroneous calculation is introduced in step 2 by changing the original correct result of 6 x 3 = 18 to a wrong result of 6 x 3 = 24. Since this is the last part of the calculation, no subsequent steps are affected, and thus step 2 is the only step with a calculation error.",
        "eval_result": "To determine if the solution is correct, we need to check if the given information is consistent with the solution.\nIn this case, the solution states that it takes aarti 6 days to complete 1 work and 24 days to complete 3 works.\nWe can set up an equation based on this information:\n6 * 1 = 24 * 3\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n6 = 72\nSince 6 does not equal 72, the solution is incorrect.\nTherefore, the correct response would be:\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is: The solution is incorrect because it does not match the given information.\n#### 72\nThe answer is: 72"
