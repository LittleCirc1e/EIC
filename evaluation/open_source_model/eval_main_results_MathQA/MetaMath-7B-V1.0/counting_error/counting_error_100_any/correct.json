        "question": "sheila works 8 hours per day on monday , wednesday and friday , and 6 hours per day on tuesday and thursday . she does not work on saturday and sunday . she earns $ 468 per week . how much does she earn in dollars per hour ?",
        "original_solution": "Total hours worked in a week = (8 * 3) + (6 * 2) = 24 + 12 = 36 hours\nShe earns $468 per week\nEarning per hour = 468 / 36\n#### 13",
        "original_answer": 13.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Total hours worked in a week = (8 * 2) + (6 * 2) = 16 + 12 = 28 hours\nShe earns $468 per week\nEarning per hour = 468 / 28\n#### 16.7142857143",
        "transformed_answer": 16.7142857143,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 erroneously counts Monday, Wednesday, and Friday as 2 days each instead of 3, reducing the total worked hours from (8 * 3) to (8 * 2). This counting error affects only the calculation related to the total hours worked (step 1) and subsequently changes the earning per hour computation (step 3) from 468 / 36 = 13 to 468 / 28 = 16.7142857143. It should be noted that the counting error should only be at one place, and the other calculation processes after the count alteration stay correct.",
        "eval_result": "The solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #.\nTo determine the correct answer, we need to work the given equation.\nLet's break down the information given:\nTotal hours worked in a week: 28 hours\nEarnings per week: $468\nEarning per hour: $468 / 28 = $17.142857143\nThe correct answer is: 17.142857143"
