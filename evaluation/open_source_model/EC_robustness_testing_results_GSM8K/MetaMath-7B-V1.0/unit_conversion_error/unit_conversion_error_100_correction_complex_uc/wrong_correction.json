        "question": "To make a cherry pie, Veronica needs 3 pounds of pitted cherries. There are 80 single cherries in one pound of cherries. It takes 10 minutes to pit 20 cherries. How many hours will it take Veronica to pit all the cherries?",
        "original_solution": "There are 80 cherries in a pound and she needs 3 pounds to make a pie so she needs 80*3 = 240 cherries\nIt takes her 10 minutes to pit a unit of 20 cherries. She has 240/20 = 12 units of cherries to pit\nIt takes 10 minutes to pit a unit of cherries and she has 12 units so it will take her 10*12 = 120 minutes\n60 minutes are in 1 hour and it takes her 120 minutes so that’s 120/60 = 2 hours\n#### 2",
        "original_answer": 2.0,
        "transformed_solution": "There are 80 cherries in a pound and she needs 3 pounds to make a pie so she needs 80*3 = 240 cherries\nIt takes her 10 minutes to pit a unit of 20 cherries. She has 240/20 = 12 units of cherries to pit\nIt takes 10 minutes to pit a unit of cherries and she has 12 units so it will take her 10*12 = 120 minutes\n50 minutes are in 1 hour and it takes her 120 minutes so that’s 120/50 = 2.4 hours\n#### 2.4",

        "wrong_step": 4,
        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 4 contains an incorrect unit conversion, erroneously stating that 50 minutes are in an hour instead of the correct 60 minutes. This error alters the computation from 120/60 = 2 hours in the original solution to 120/50 = 2.4 hours in the transformed solution. This error affects only the related unit conversion in the final step, while previous calculations remain unaffected.",
        "eval_result": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the number of hours it will take Veronica to pit all the cherries.\nWe know that it takes her 10 minutes to pit 20 cherries, and she has 12 units of cherries to pit (240 cherries in total).\nLet's calculate the total time it will take her to pit all the cherries:\nTime per unit of cherries: 10 minutes\nNumber of units of cherries: 12\nTotal time to pit all the cherries: 10 minutes/unit * 12 units = 120 minutes\nWe also know that 50 minutes are in 1 hour, so we can convert the total time to hours:\n120 minutes / 50 minutes/hour = 2.4 hours\nTherefore, the value of the unknown variable x is 2.4. The solution is incorrect, and the correct answer is 2.4 hours.\n#### 2.4\nThe answer is: 2.4"
