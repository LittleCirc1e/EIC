        "explanation": "Step 4 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <Because he received an extra $2.00 bonus from happy customers for every delivery made on Sunday>, resulting in a new calculation for the additional bonus of $16.00 for Sunday deliveries. This creates a change in the final total from the original solution, with the total pay changing from 90+65 = $155.00 to 90+65+16 = $171.00 in the transformed solution. The addition is made into an existing step and directly affects the final result, differentiating the transformed answer from the original one.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. The calculation is correct, and the explanation for each step is provided.\n\nThe first step is correct, as Scout worked 4 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, for a total of 9 hours. The calculation of $10 per hour x 9 hours = $90 is also correct.\n\nThe second step is correct, as Scout delivered groceries to 5 people on Saturday and 8 people on Sunday, for a total of 13 deliveries. The calculation of $5 per delivery x 13 deliveries = $65 is also correct.\n\nThe third step is correct, as Scout received an extra $2 bonus from happy customers for every delivery made on Sunday, and he made 8 deliveries on Sunday, resulting in an additional $2 x 8 = $16 in bonuses.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Scout made over the weekend is $90 + $65 + $16 = $171.\n\nThe explanation for each step is provided in the response, and the calculation is correct."
