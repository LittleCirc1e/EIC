        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and area of rectangle. The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the sum of all sides, which is equivalent to finding the perimeter of the rectangle, resulting in the correct formula 8 x 12 = 96 in the original_solution being changed to 8 + 12 + 8 + 12 = 40 in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 2, changing from 96 x 8 = 768 to 40 x 8 = 320.

The calculation for the area of each glass pane is correct, and the total area of the window is calculated correctly by multiplying the area of each pane by 8.\n\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #. In step 2, there is a mistake in the calculation of the area of the first glass pane. The correct calculation is 8 x 12 = 96 sq in, not 8 + 12 + 8 + 12 = 40 sq in. As a result, the total area of the window is calculated incorrectly in step 5, resulting in the final incorrect answer."

        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the area and perimeter of the rectangle. The question requires solving for the total area of the mural in order to know how many square-inch tiles are needed, which is the product of its length and height, not the sum. This change is made by swapping multiplication for addition, transforming the correct area formula (length * height) into an incorrect perimeter one (length + height), thus altering the calculation from 180 inches * 120 inches = 21600 square inches to 180 inches + 120 inches = 300 inches. This fundamentally changes the answer from an area to what would be a linear measure, affecting only the formula in step 3 while leaving the language descriptions and the calculations in the prior steps unchanged. As such, the confused formula results in an erroneous count of tiles that would be needed if the mural's perimeter rather than its area were relevant.",
