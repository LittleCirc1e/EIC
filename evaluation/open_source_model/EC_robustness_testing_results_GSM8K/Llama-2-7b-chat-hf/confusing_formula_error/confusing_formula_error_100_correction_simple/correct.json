        "question": "How many right triangles with a height of 2 inches and a width of two inches could fit inside a square with 2-inch sides?",
        "original_solution": "A triangle with a height of 2 inches and width of 2 inches has an area of 2 square inches because (1/2) x 2 x 2 = 2\nThe square has an area of 4 square inches because 2 x 2 = 4\n2 triangles would fit because 4 / 2 = 2\n#### 2",
        "original_answer": 2.0,
        "transformed_solution": "A triangle with a height of 2 inches and width of 2 inches has an area of 2 square inches because (1/2) x 2 + 2 = 3\nThe square has an area of 4 square inches because 2 x 2 = 4\n2 triangles would fit because 4 / 3 = 1.3333\n#### 1.3333",

        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 incorrectly calculates the area of a triangle by adding rather than multiplying the base and height and then dividing by 2. The correct formula for the area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height, which would result in (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2 square inches. However, the transformed_solution changes this to (1/2) * 2 + 2 = 3, which is a misunderstanding of the formula for the area of a triangle, resulting in an incorrect area calculation. This incorrect area affects the subsequent step, changing the calculation of how many triangles would fit from 4 / 2 = 2 to 4 / 3 â‰ˆ 1.3333. It is important to note that the transformed_solution only alters the formula application in step 1, while the other steps remain correct in their calculations, although they use the incorrect value from the first step to carry out the division.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #2 triangles could fit inside a square with 2-inch sides.\n\nThe error occurs in step 3, where the calculation 4 / 3 = 1.3333 is incorrect. The correct calculation is 4 / 3 = 1.333. Therefore, the final answer is #2 triangles could fit inside a square with 2-inch sides."
