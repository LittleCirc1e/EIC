        "question": "Jerry needs to shingle 3 roofs. Each roof is made of two slanted rectangular sides measuring 20 feet by 40 feet. If he needs 8 shingles to cover one square foot of roof, how many shingles does he need total?",
        "original_solution": "First find the area of one side of a roof: 20 feet * 40 feet = 800 square feet\nThen multiply that number by 2 to find the total area of both sides of the roof: 800 square feet/side * 2 sides = 1600 square feet\nThen multiply that number by the number of roofs to find the total area of all the roofs: 1600 square feet/roof * 3 roofs = 4800 square feet\nThen multiply the total area of the roofs by the number of shingles needed per square foot to find the total number of shingles needed: 4800 square feet * 8 singles/square foot = 38400 shingles\n#### 38400",
        "original_answer": 38400.0,
        "transformed_solution": "First find the area of one side of a roof: 20 feet + 40 feet + 20 feet + 40 feet = 120 square feet\nThen multiply that number by 2 to find the total area of both sides of the roof: 120 square feet/side * 2 sides = 240 square feet\nThen multiply that number by the number of roofs to find the total area of all the roofs: 240 square feet/roof * 3 roofs = 720 square feet\nThen multiply the total area of the roofs by the number of shingles needed per square foot to find the total number of shingles needed: 720 square feet * 8 singles/square foot = 5760 shingles\n#### 5760",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and area of rectangle. The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the sum of all its sides, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle, resulting in 20 feet * 40 feet = 800 square feet in the original_solution becoming 20 feet + 40 feet + 20 feet + 40 feet = 120 square feet in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent related steps due to the propagation of the error in the calculations, changing the original answers from 1600 square feet, 4800 square feet, and 38400 shingles to the transformed answers of 240 square feet, 720 square feet, and 5760 shingles respectively. Note that the language description of step 1 <First find the area of one side of a roof> in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that only step 1 has the confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes follow this mistaken step correctly.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct. The explanation is: To find the area of one side of a roof, we added the lengths of the two slanted rectangular sides. Then, we multiplied that number by 2 to find the total area of both sides of the roof. Finally, we multiplied the total area of the roofs by the number of shingles needed per square foot to find the total number of shingles needed.\n\nThe correct answer is 5760 shingles."

        "original_solution": "First convert the length of the mural to inches: 15 feet * 12 inches/foot = 180 inches\nThen convert the height of the mural to inches: 10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches\nThen multiply the length and the height to find the total area of the mural: 180 inches * 120 inches = 21600 square inches.

        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the area and perimeter of the rectangle. The question requires solving for the total area of the mural in order to know how many square-inch tiles are needed, which is the product of its length and height, not the sum. This change is made by swapping multiplication for addition, transforming the correct area formula (length * height) into an incorrect perimeter one (length + height), thus altering the calculation from 180 inches * 120 inches = 21600 square inches to 180 inches + 120 inches = 300 inches. This fundamentally changes the answer from an area to what would be a linear measure, affecting only the formula in step 3 while leaving the language descriptions and the calculations in the prior steps unchanged. As such, the confused formula results in an erroneous count of tiles that would be needed if the mural's perimeter rather than its area were relevant.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct. The explanation is: The total perimeter of the mural is 300 inches, which is the number of tiles Mary needs to cover the mural. The formula used to calculate the perimeter is correct, and the conversion from feet to inches is accurate.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to assist you with any other tasks."
