        "question": "Linda is painting her bedroom. Her bedroom has 4 walls, with the room being 20 feet wide by 20 feet long by 8 feet tall. One wall has a 3-foot by 7-foot doorway. A second wall has a 6-foot by 4-foot window. A third wall has a 5-foot by 7-foot doorway to a walk-in-closet. And the fourth wall is completely solid. What is the total area of wall space that Linda will have to paint?",
        "original_solution": "The solid wall is 8 ft. * 20 ft. = 160 sq. ft.\nThe doorway is 3 ft. * 7 ft. = 21 sq. ft.\nThe window is 6 ft. * 4 ft. = 24 sq. ft.\nThe closet door is 5 ft. * 7 ft. = 35 sq. ft.\nThe total area of the doors and windows is 21 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 80 sq. ft.\nThe solid wall is 160 sq. ft., so before the areas of the doors and window are taken into account, the total wall area is 4 * 160 sq. ft. = 640 sq. ft.\nTaking into account the doors and window, the total wall area Linda will have to paint is 640 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 560 sq. ft.\n#### 560",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The question requires that the area of the wall to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by height, rather than the sum of all sides of the wall, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle, resulting in 8 ft. * 20 ft. = 160 sq. ft. in the original_solution being changed to 8 ft. + 20 ft. + 8 ft. + 20 ft. = 56 sq. ft. in the transformed_solution. This affects steps that calculate the wall area, specifically step 6, changing from 640 sq. ft. to 224 sq. ft. Note that the language descriptions of the original_solution remain unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 1 mistakenly uses the formula for rectangle perimeter, while the other calculation processes involving areas are still correct.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 560, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 3. Step 3 confuses the perimeter and area formulas of rectangle and it should calculate the area of the rectangle which is equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the length plus length plus width plus width, equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle. That means, it should calculate 6 ft. * 4 ft. = 24 sq. ft. instead of 6 ft. + 4 ft. + 6 ft. + 4 ft. = 20 sq. ft. Step 5 and 7, as the subsequent steps of step 2, reference the wrong result of step 2, resulting in the incorrect final answer. Step 5 miscalculates 21 sq. ft + 20 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 76 sq. ft. instead of 21 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 80 sq. ft.
