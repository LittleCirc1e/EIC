Step 2 calculates the volume of the box by multiplying the length, width, and height of the box, which is the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism. However, the box is not a rectangular prism, but a cube, as it has all sides of equal length. Therefore, the volume of the box is not V = L * W * H, but V = L * W * H / 3, where H is the height of the box.

The surface area includes the walls and ceiling, not the floor, and should be calculated using the formula for area, not perimeter.

The question asks for the perimeter needed for fencing, including gates, which requires summing twice the length and twice the width.

This mistake changes the operation from perimeter calculation (2 * 225 + 2 * 125) in the original solution to an area calculation (225 * 125) in the transformed solution. As a result, step 2 is affected by using the wrong value for the garden dimensions, changing from subtracting the gate widths from the correct perimeter (700 - 3 - 10) to subtracting them from the incorrect area calculation (28125 - 3 - 10).

He also wants to have a small 3-foot wide gate to walk through and a larger 10-foot wide gate to move his gardening equipment through. How much fencing is Bob going to need to fence in his garden, taking into account the two gates?",
        "original_solution": "The perimeter of the garden is 2 * 225 + 2 * 125 = 450 + 250 = 700 feet.\nMinus the two gates, he will need at least 700 - 3 - 10 = 687 feet of fencing.\n#### 687",

The question requires that the perimeter of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the sum of twice its length and twice its width, rather than the length multiplied by the width, which is equivalent to the area of the rectangle, resulting in 2 * 225 + 2 * 125 = 700 feet in the original_solution being changed to 225 * 125 = 28125 square feet in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 2, changing from 700 - 3 - 10 = 687 feet to 28125 - 3 - 10 = 28112 feet. Note that the language description of step 1 < The perimeter of the garden is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct.
