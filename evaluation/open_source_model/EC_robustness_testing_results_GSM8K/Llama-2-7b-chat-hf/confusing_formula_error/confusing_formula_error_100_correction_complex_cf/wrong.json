Note that the language description of step 1 < First find the area of one side of a roof > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. Likewise, the wrong_type should remain consistent as 'confusing_formula_error' since the formula used for calculation has been mistakenly used from the perimeter instead of the area, and it is still a single error affecting all the subsequent steps based on the area calculation.",

The first step correctly calculates the perimeter of one side of the roof using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is the sum of the lengths of all four sides. The second step correctly calculates the total perimeter of both sides of the roof by multiplying the perimeter of one side by 2. The third step correctly calculates the total perimeter of all the roofs by multiplying the total perimeter of one side by the number of roofs. The fourth step correctly calculates the total number of shingles needed by multiplying the total perimeter of all the roofs by the number of shingles needed per square foot.\n\nPlease provide the next question and solution for me to complete."
