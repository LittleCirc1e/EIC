It should be noted that step 1 in the transformed_solution <Every week Carl needs to drive additional 6 hours, so in two weeks that would make 2 * 6 = 12 additional hours.> should be the same as the step 1 in the original_solution <Every week Carl needs to drive additional 6 hours, so in two weeks that would make 2 * 6 = 12 additional hours.> and calculates its result 12 correctly. Step 2 in the transformed_solution <Two weeks of driving 2 hours every day, means 14 * 2 = 28 hours of driving.> should also be the same as step 2 in the original_solution, and calculates its result 28 correctly. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all steps is still correct.",
