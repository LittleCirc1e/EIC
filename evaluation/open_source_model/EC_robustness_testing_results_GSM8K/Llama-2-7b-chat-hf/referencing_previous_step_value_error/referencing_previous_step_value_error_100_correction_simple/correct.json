        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #.\n\nThe solution is incorrect because it assumes that Brian's improvement is linear, when in fact it is exponential. After the first week, Brian has doubled his time to 20 seconds, but after the second week, he has doubled it again to 40 seconds, not 80 seconds as the solution states. Similarly, after the third week, he has increased his time by 50% from the previous week, not 100% as the solution states. Therefore, the correct answer is #60 seconds."
