        "question": "Uncle Ben has 440 chickens on his farm. 39 are roosters and the rest are hens. 15 of his hens do not lay eggs, and the rest do. If each egg-laying hen lays 3 eggs, how many eggs will Uncle Ben have?",
        "original_solution": "Uncle Ben has 440 chickens - 39 roosters = 401 hens.\nUncle Ben has 401 hens - 15 that don't lay eggs = 386 hens that lay eggs.\nThe egg-laying hens each lay 3 eggs * 386 hens = 1158 eggs.\n#### 1158",
        "original_answer": 1158.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Uncle Ben has 440 chickens - 39 roosters = 401 hens.\nUncle Ben has 401 hens - 15 that don't lay eggs = 385 hens that lay eggs.\nThe egg-laying hens each lay 3 eggs * 385 hens = 1155 eggs.\n#### 1155",

        "explanation": "Step 2 mistakenly references 401 as 401 from step 1 but changes 401 - 15 to 385 instead of the correct 386. It should be noted that step 1 in the transformed_solution <Uncle Ben has 440 chickens - 39 roosters = 401 hens.> should be the same as the step 1 in the original_solution <Uncle Ben has 440 chickens - 39 roosters = 401 hens.> and calculates its result 401 correctly. The subsequent step 3, which is related to step 2, is affected by the incorrect subtraction result but is still calculated correctly as 3 * 385 to give 1155 eggs. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all steps is still correct, and the transformed_answer 1155 is different from the original_answer 1158.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct. The explanation is: The solution is correct because it takes into account the number of roosters and the number of hens that lay eggs, and it calculates the total number of eggs correctly.\n\nIf the solution was incorrect, the response would be:\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 1200 eggs. The explanation is: The solution is incorrect because it does not take into account the number of hens that do not lay eggs. If 15 hens do not lay eggs, then the total number of eggs is 1200."
