As a result, subsequent references to the number of blue pens left have been affected. Specifically, step 2 in the transformed solution directly references the original number of blue pens (9) instead of the calculated number of remaining blue pens (5), causing a change from 5+14+6=25 to 9+14+6=29. Hence, step 2 becomes the first step that references the incorrect number of pens in the transformed solution, making it the 'wrong_step'. The choice of the largest number to reference, in this case, aligns with the number of blue pens initially present before any were removed, which was 9.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #25.\n\nExplanation: The solution is incorrect because there are 7 black pens removed, not 4. So, the number of black pens left in the jar is 14 + 7 = 21, not 14. Therefore, the total number of pens left in the jar is 9 + 21 = 30, not 29."

By deleting the first step, we must adjust the second step to directly use information from the question; however, we should still ensure that the final answer is different from the original answer. Therefore, the second step should begin with 5 plus twice Ferdinand's number assuming Ferdinand's original number 6 directly from the question (2*(6/2) instead of 2*3). However, to generate a different transformed answer, an error is introduced by not updating the numerical operations correctly. The formula is altered incorrectly to 5+2*3=5+6=11 trees. Finally, instead of subtracting Ferdinand's mistaken number of trees (which could be 6 after deleting the first step), we subtract the correct original amount (3 trees), resulting in a wrong answer of 11-3=8 trees. The transformed answer should be 5 to be different from the original answer.

Originally Eddie's contribution is 3 * 7 = 21, but since we're no longer calculating this, we directly use 3*7 in the sum, hence the new formula becomes 3*7 + 42 + 56 = 119. However, an error was introduced in the transformed solution: instead of summing up the correct numbers to maintain the original answer, the total was incorrectly added as 3*7 + 42 + 56 = 133. Due to this error, the transformed answer differs from the original. The wrong_step is 3 which is the first step that has the incorrect reference in the transformed_solution.
