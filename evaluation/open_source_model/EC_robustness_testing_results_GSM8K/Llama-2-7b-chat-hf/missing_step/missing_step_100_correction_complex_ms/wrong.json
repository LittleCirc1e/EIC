        "explanation": "In this example, step 2 from the original_solution has been removed. In the original_solution, each step references the result of the previous step. So after deleting step 2, we need to change step 1 (which becomes the new step 1 in the transformed_solution) to refer to the temperature increase across 4 hours (since the missing step accounted for 2 hours) instead of 2. Therefore, step 1 of the transformed_solution should double the increase to cover 4 hours (resulting in 1.5 degrees * 2). The subsequent steps should now reference the result from the new step 1. Consequently, the formula changes to 50 degrees + 1.5 degrees * 2 = 53 degrees. It is now the new step 1 in the transformed_solution that serves as the first step referencing the incorrect number (which should've been 51.5 degrees), due to the deletion of the original step 2, so the wrong_step is 1.",

The first step correctly determines the temperature at 5 A.M. by adding 1.5 degrees to the initial temperature.

So after deleting step 1, step 4 should change and reference the number 6 (number of correct answers in the easy round) directly from the question since it is the largest number in this case. This causes the formula to change from 12 points + 6 points + 20 points = 38 points to 6*2 points + 6 points + 20 points = 32 points, with the understanding that the easy round's score is calculated directly in the final summation.

The explanation is that the points given for each round are calculated by multiplying the number of correct answers by the points assigned to each round, and then adding up the points from all the rounds. In this case, Kim got 6 correct answers in the easy round, 2 correct answers in the average round, and 4 correct answers in the difficult round, so she earned 6 x 2 points + 6 points + 20 points = 32 points."
