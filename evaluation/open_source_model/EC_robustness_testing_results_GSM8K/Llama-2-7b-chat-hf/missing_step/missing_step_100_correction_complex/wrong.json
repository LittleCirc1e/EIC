        "question": "A gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?",
        "original_solution": "The discount for each gallon of whole milk is $3 - $2 = $1.\nSo the discount for 3 gallons of whole milk is $1/gallon x 3 gallons = $3.\nThe total discount for 5 boxes of cereal is $1/box x 5 boxes = $5.\nYou will save $3 + $5 = $8 for 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal.\n#### 8",
        "original_answer": 8.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total discount for 5 boxes of cereal is $1/box x 5 boxes = $5.\nYou will save $3 + $5 = $8 for 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal.\n#### 8",

        "explanation": "In this example, the first intermediate step, which calculates the discount for each gallon of whole milk, has been deleted. In the original_solution, step 1 provides the discount per gallon of milk, which is then used in step 2. With the deletion of step 1, the correct discount of $1 per gallon is no longer applied to the 3 gallons of milk. Instead, the number from the question, which is the largest number referenced in the deleted step 1, should be used for the subsequent related steps. This leads to the erroneous assumption that the discount for 3 gallons of milk would be $3 without properly calculating. The modification of step 2 should have been from $1/gallon x 3 gallons = $3 to $3/gallon x 3 gallons = $9. Instead, the original $3 from step 2 is kept, which does not reflect the deletion of step 1. The total would then be incorrectly calculated in step 2 as $3 + $5 = $8, leading to an incorrect total discount of $8 instead of the correct $11, which is the result of $9 for milk plus $5 for cereal. Thus, the transformed_answer should be $11, but remains erroneously as $8. The wrong_step is identified as 1 because it is the first step in the transformed_solution that references an incorrect number due to the deletion.",

So after deleting step 1, step 4 should change and reference the number 6 (number of correct answers in the easy round) directly from the question since it is the largest number in this case. This causes the formula to change from 12 points + 6 points + 20 points = 38 points to 6*2 points + 6 points + 20 points = 32 points, with the understanding that the easy round's score is calculated directly in the final summation. Since the deletion of step 1 affects the final summation, it is considered the first and only mistake in the transformed solution, so the wrong_step is 1.",

In the original_solution, step 1 includes calculations about the cost of the toy cars referencing the numbers 6 and $2 from the question, and step 3 references the result $12 from step 1. In the transformed_solution, since step 1 is removed, step 3 should originally reference the result of step 1; after deletion, it should reference the number 6 and $2 from the question, and choose the larger number $2 to keep. As a result, step 3 should change, but since it does not, this introduces an error. Consequently, the transformed_solution omits the cost of 6 cars × $2/car = $12, incorrectly calculating the remaining money. The first step to contain an error is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is step 3 in the original_solution, indicating that Dean has $38 - $5 = $33 left, so the wrong_step is 1.",

The transformed_solution combines steps 1 and 3 of the original_solution, assuming Carl works the same number of hours as Josh.
