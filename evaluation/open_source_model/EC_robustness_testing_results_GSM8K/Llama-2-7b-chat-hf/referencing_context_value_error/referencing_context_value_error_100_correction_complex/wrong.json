        "explanation": "Step 2 references 4 in the question as 5 wrongly, and calculates 5 + 10 = 15 hours a week instead of 4 + 10 = 14 hours a week. Its subsequent related step will be affected, calculating 15 hours x 24 weeks = 360 hours on the course instead of 14 hours x 24 weeks = 336 hours. Please note that you should only consider one error, so step 3 still references 24 in the question correctly.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. The calculation of hours spent in class is correct, and the addition of hours spent on small group work is also correct. The final answer of 360 hours is the total hours spent on the course."
