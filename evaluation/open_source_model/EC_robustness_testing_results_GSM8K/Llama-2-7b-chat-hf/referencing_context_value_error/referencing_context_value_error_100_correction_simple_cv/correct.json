        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #10 rectangles.\n\nThe explanation is: The solution is incorrect because there is a calculation error in step 1. The formula for the area of a rectangle is A = L x W, where L is the length and W is the width. In step 1, the solution calculates the length of the rectangle as 1638 / 40.95 = 40.95 inches. However, this is not the correct calculation, as the length of the rectangle is 1638 inches, not 40.95 inches. Therefore, the number of rectangles required to reach 390 inches is 10, not 9."
