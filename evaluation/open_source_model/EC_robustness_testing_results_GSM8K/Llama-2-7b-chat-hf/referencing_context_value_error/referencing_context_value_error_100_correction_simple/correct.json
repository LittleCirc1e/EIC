Its subsequent related step will be affected, calculating 390 / 40.95 ≈ 9 rectangles instead of 390 / 39 = 10 rectangles in step 2.

        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #10 rectangles.\n\nThe explanation is: The solution is incorrect because it assumes that the length of the rectangle is 1638 inches, but the question states that the width is 42 inches. Therefore, the length of the rectangle is actually 42 inches x 1638 inches/42 inches = 390 inches. Therefore, there are 10 rectangles of the same size that would reach a length of 390 inches."
