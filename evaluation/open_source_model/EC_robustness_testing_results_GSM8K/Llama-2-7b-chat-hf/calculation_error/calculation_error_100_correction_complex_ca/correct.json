Maddox sold his cameras at $28 each, while Theo sold his cameras at $23 each. How much more profit did Maddox get from the sale of his cameras than Theo?",
        "original_solution": "The total cost of buying 3 cameras from Amazon for both Maddox and Theo was 3*$20=$60\nMaddox sold his cameras at $28 each, for a total of $28*3=$84\nMaddox made a profit of $84-$60=$24 from the sale of his cameras.\nTheo sold his cameras on eBay for $23*3=$69\nTheo made a profit of $69-$60=$9\nMaddox made $24-$9=$15 more profit than Theo from the sale of his cameras.\n#### 15",

        "explanation": "The miscalculation occurs at step 4, where the total sales for Theo’s cameras are incorrectly calculated as $23*3=$59 instead of $23*3=$69. This error affects Theo’s profit calculation in step 5, changing the correct profit from $9 to -$1, and further affects the comparison of Maddox’s profit to Theo’s profit in step 6, resulting in an incorrect higher profit for Maddox of $25 instead of $15.",

If the [Solution] is correct, format your response as: The solution is correct, and the explanation is #.\n\nIn this case, the [Solution] is incorrect because it makes a calculation error in step 6. The correct calculation for Theo's profit is $59 x 3 = $177, not $59. Therefore, the final answer should be $25 more than Theo's profit, which is $177 - $162 = $15.\n\nThe correct output should be: The solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 15, and the explanation is that step 6 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 177 instead of 162, resulting in the final incorrect answer."
