        "original_solution": "If there are 200 lions in the park, which is twice the number of leopards in the park, there are 200/2 = 100 leopards in the park.\nThe total population of lions and leopards in the park is 200 lions + 100 leopards = 300\nThe number of elephants in the park is 1/2 the total population of lions and leopards; thus, there are 300/2 = 150 elephants in the park.\nThere are a total of 150+300 = 450 animals in the park.\n#### 450",
        "original_answer": 450,
        "transformed_solution": "If there are 200 lions in the park, which is twice the number of leopards in the park, there are 200/2 = 100 leopards in the park.\nThe total population of lions and leopards in the park is 200 lions + 100 leopards = 300\nThe number of elephants in the park is 1/2 the total population of lions and leopards; thus, there are 300/2 = 100 elephants in the park.\nThere are a total of 100+300 = 400 animals in the park.\n#### 400",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, the 300/2 calculation in step 3 has been incorrectly changed to 100 instead of 150. Subsequently, step 4 inherits the error from step 3, modifying the formula of the total number of animals from 150+300 = 450 to 100+300 = 400. The preceding steps 1 and 2 remain unaffected, along with their descriptions and calculations. The transformed answer becomes 400 instead of the original 450.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #450.\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution is incorrect because it does not take into account the total number of elephants in the park. According to the problem, the number of elephants is half the combined number of lions and leopards, which means that the total number of elephants is 100 + 300 = 400. Therefore, the total population of the three animals in the park is 400 + 100 + 300 = 450."

        "explanation": "The calculation for the number of minutes Celia takes to run 30 miles was altered from the correct calculation of 10*30=300 minutes to an incorrect answer of 290 minutes in the transformed_solution. The mistake occurs in step 2 and does not affect step 1, as it is the next independent step. Since there is only one error introduced in the transformation, the “is_single_error” is set to True, and the “wrong_type” is indicated as a “calculation_error”, reflecting that the error is a miscalculation.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #300.\n\nExplanation: The solution is incorrect because it assumes that Celia takes 10 minutes to run one mile, which is not the correct answer. Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie, so Celia takes 20/2 = 10 minutes to run one mile. Therefore, it will take Celia 10 minutes to run 30 miles, which is equal to 300 minutes."
