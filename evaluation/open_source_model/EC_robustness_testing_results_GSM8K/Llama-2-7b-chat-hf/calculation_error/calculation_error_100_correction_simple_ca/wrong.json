        "question": "Maddox and Theo both bought 3 Polaroid Cameras, each sold at $20 per camera from Amazon, and decided to sell them on eBay. Maddox sold his cameras at $28 each, while Theo sold his cameras at $23 each. How much more profit did Maddox get from the sale of his cameras than Theo?",
        "original_solution": "The total cost of buying 3 cameras from Amazon for both Maddox and Theo was 3*$20=$60\nMaddox sold his cameras at $28 each, for a total of $28*3=$84\nMaddox made a profit of $84-$60=$24 from the sale of his cameras.\nTheo sold his cameras on eBay for $23*3=$69\nTheo made a profit of $69-$60=$9\nMaddox made $24-$9=$15 more profit than Theo from the sale of his cameras.\n#### 15",

        "transformed_solution": "The total cost of buying 3 cameras from Amazon for both Maddox and Theo was 3*$20=$60\nMaddox sold his cameras at $28 each, for a total of $28*3=$84\nMaddox made a profit of $84-$60=$24 from the sale of his cameras.\nTheo sold his cameras on eBay for $23*3=$59\nTheo made a profit of $59-$60=-$1\nMaddox made $24-(-$1)=$25 more profit than Theo from the sale of his cameras.\n#### 25",

        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The miscalculation occurs at step 4, where the total sales for Theo’s cameras are incorrectly calculated as $23*3=$59 instead of $23*3=$69. This error affects Theo’s profit calculation in step 5, changing the correct profit from $9 to -$1, and further affects the comparison of Maddox’s profit to Theo’s profit in step 6, resulting in an incorrect higher profit for Maddox of $25 instead of $15.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. Maddox made $25 more profit than Theo from the sale of their cameras because Maddox sold his cameras at a higher price than Theo, resulting in a higher profit. The calculation error in the Solution is the result of a miscalculation of the total cost of buying the cameras from Amazon, which affects the calculation of the profit."

        "question": "Annie has 6 barrettes, twice as many scrunchies as barrettes, and three fewer bobby pins than barrettes. What percentage of her hair decorations are bobby pins, rounded to the nearest percent?",
        "original_solution": "First find the total number of scrunchies: 6 barrettes * 2 = 12 scrunchies\nThen subtract three fewer bobby pins than barrettes 6-3 =3 bobby pins\nThen add the number of each type of hair decorations to find the total number: 6 decorations + 12 decorations + 3 decorations = 21 decorations\nThen divide the number of bobby pins by the total number of decorations and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 3 bobby pins / 21 decorations * 100% = 14.28 which rounds down to 14%\n#### 14",

        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The error is introduced in step 2 where the number of bobby pins is mistakenly calculated as 6 instead of 3. This error affects subsequent step 3, which changes the addition from 6 decorations + 12 decorations + 3 decorations to 6 decorations + 12 decorations + 6 decorations, which results in a total of 24 decorations instead of 21. Step 4 then uses this incorrect total to calculate the percentage, resulting in 6/24 * 100% = 25% instead of the correct calculation with 3/21 decorations. The previous step 1 remains unchanged because it is correct and unrelated to the error in step 2.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct. The explanation is: The total number of hair decorations is 24, and the percentage of bobby pins is 25%, which rounds down to 25%.\n\nThe calculation is correct, and the explanation is clear and concise. Good job!"
