        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, the 300/2 calculation in step 3 has been incorrectly changed to 100 instead of 150. Subsequently, step 4 inherits the error from step 3, modifying the formula of the total number of animals from 150+300 = 450 to 100+300 = 400. The preceding steps 1 and 2 remain unaffected, along with their descriptions and calculations. The transformed answer becomes 400 instead of the original 450.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #450.\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution is incorrect because there is a calculation error in step 3. The total population of lions and leopards is 200 + 100 = 300, not 300. Therefore, the number of elephants is 1/2 the total population of lions and leopards, which is 300/2 = 150 elephants in the park. Therefore, the total number of animals in the park is 150 + 200 = 350, not 400."

The mistake occurs in step 2 and does not affect step 1, as it is the next independent step. Since there is only one error introduced in the transformation, the “is_single_error” is set to True, and the “wrong_type” is indicated as a “calculation_error”, reflecting that the error is a miscalculation.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #300.\n\nExplanation: The error occurs in the second step, where Celia's time is calculated as 10 minutes to run one mile. The correct calculation is 10/2 = 5 minutes to run one mile, since Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie. Therefore, it will take Celia 5 minutes to run one mile, and it will take her 300 minutes to run 30 miles."
