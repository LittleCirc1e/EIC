        "original_solution": "She rode 1 hour every Monday, Wednesday and Friday each week so every week she rode 1*3 = 3 hours\nShe rode 30 min on Tuesday and Thursday each week for a total of 30*2 = 60 min or 1 hour\nOn Mon, Wed & Friday she rode 3 hours, 1 hour total on Tue and Thur and 2 hours on Sat for a total of 3+1+2 = 6 hours\nShe rode 6 hours per week for 2 weeks so in total she rode 6*2 = 12 hours\n#### 12",

        "explanation": "This transformation changes the result of the last calculation from 6*2 = 12 to 6*2 = 11, which is a clear calculation error. The steps prior to this are unaffected, as the operands or operators of those steps have not been changed. Consequently, only step 4 in the original solution is altered to reflect this single calculation error, resulting in an answer of 11 hours instead of the correct 12 hours. The rest of the transformed solution must be accurately derived from the incorrect product of this wrong step.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 12, and the explanation is that step 3 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 60 minutes instead of 30 minutes, and step 5 references the result of step 3, calculating 6 hours instead of 3 hours. The total time ridden is 12 hours."

        "original_solution": "First we find out how long it would take Mr. Harris to walk to your destination, which we find by multiplying his 2 hour walk by 3 since your destination is 3 times further away, meaning it would take him 2*3= 6 hours.\nSince you walk twice as fast, it would take you half the time.
