Consequently, step 3, which is related to step 2, calculates the number of days based on this incorrect conversion, changing from an original solution of 3000 minutes total to 2500 minutes total. The calculation now shows Jessica would need 62.5 days instead of 75 days to meet the driving requirement.

Additionally, the solution assumes that Liz can start roasting the turkeys immediately after preheating the oven, which is not the case. It takes time to preheat the oven, and Liz cannot start roasting the turkeys until the oven has reached the desired temperature.\n\nTo correct the solution, we need to take into account the time it takes to preheat the oven. Let's assume it takes 30 minutes to preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, which is a reasonable time based on the size of the oven.
