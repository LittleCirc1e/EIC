The subsequent step 3 related to it reflects this change, modifying 28/7 = 4 portions to 28/40 = 0.7 portions. It should be noted that step 1 has an incorrect operator change but still calculates its result correctly according to the new operation.

The wrong operator change in step 1 leads to the wrong result in step 3, but the arithmetic on those wrong values is itself correct.",
