        "original_solution": "The cost of 5 hamburgers is 5 x $4 = $20.\nThe cost of 10 packs of potato fries is 10 x $0.30 = $3.\nAnd, the cost of 5 cans of fruit drinks is 5 x $2 = $10.\nThus, the total cost is $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.\nTherefore, Carly gets a change of $50 - $33 = $17.\n#### 17",

This consequently changes the solution of the final step calculating change from $50 - $33 = $17 to $50 - $27 = $23. It should be noted that the operator change occurs in the calculation of the total cost, which leads to an incorrect result that then affects the final step of calculating the change given back to Carly.
