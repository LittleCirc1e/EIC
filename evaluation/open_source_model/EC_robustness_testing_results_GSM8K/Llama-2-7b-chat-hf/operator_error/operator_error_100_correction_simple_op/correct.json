        "original_solution": "Julia owns 3 * 20 = 60 bronze watches.\n60+20 = 80 total silver and bronze watches\n10% of all Julia's watches is 80 * 10/100 = 8 watches, and she decided to buy so many gold watches.\nSo in total Julia is in possession of 20 + 60 + 8 = 88 watches.\n#### 88",
        "original_answer": 88.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Julia owns 3 * 20 = 60 bronze watches.\n60-20 = 40 total silver and bronze watches\n10% of all Julia's watches is 40 * 10/100 = 4 watches, and she decided to buy so many gold watches.\nSo in total Julia is in possession of 20 + 60 + 4 = 84 watches.\n#### 84",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example transforms the addition in step 2 to subtraction, altering 60+20 = 80 to 60-20 = 40 by changing + to -. This impacts the following step 3, as the calculation of 10% of Julia's watches is based on the modified total number of watches, changing 80 * 10/100 = 8 to 40 * 10/100 = 4. The final step 4 also inherits this change, adjusting from 20 + 60 + 8 = 88 to 20 + 60 + 4 = 84. It should be noted that in step 2, only the operator of the formula is incorrect, but the step still performs the correct mathematical operation accordingly, resulting in an incorrect outcome for that step. The subsequent steps that rely on the outcome of step 2 correctly perform their calculations based on the erroneous value provided.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #88.\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution is incorrect because it does not consider the operator error in step 3. In step 3, the solution states that 10% of all Julia's watches is 40 * 10/100 = 4 watches, and it decides to buy so many gold watches. However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not consider the bronze watches that Julia already owns. Julia already owns 3 times as many bronze watches as silver watches, which means she owns 3 * 20 = 60 bronze watches. Therefore, the total number of watches Julia owns after buying gold watches is 20 + 60 + 4 = 84 watches, not 88 watches."
