        "original_solution": "There are 60/100 * 15 = 9 more green cards than red cards.\nWhich means there are 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.\nYellow cards make up to 15 + 24 = 39 cards.\nSo in total, there are 39 + 39 = 78 cards of different colors.\n#### 78",

        "explanation": "The example changes the addition in the second step of the calculation to subtraction by turning the correct form '15 + 9 = 24' into '15 - 9 = 6', thus showing an incorrect number of green cards. This logically affects the related subsequent steps. The next step incorrectly calculates the number of yellow cards (now the sum is 15 + 6 = 21), and the final total is incorrectly calculated as 21 + 21 = 42 cards. It should be noted that the operator is only incorrect in the second step with the calculation correctly made based on the incorrect operator, leading to incorrect results for the subsequent figures that rely on it.",
