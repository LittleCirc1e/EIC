        "question": "Bill picked 50 apples from the orchard with his wife and two children.  He sends each of his kids to school with 3 apples for their two favorite teachers.  His wife Jill bakes two apple pies, using 10 apples per pie. How many apples does Bill have left?",
        "original_solution": "Bill gives each of his children 3 apples, so since he has two children this is 3*2=6 apples.\nJill bakes 2 apple pies, using 10 apples each so this means she uses 10*2=20 apples.\nIn total, this means 20+6=26 apples were used.\nSince Bill began with 50 apples, this means there are 50-26=24 apples remaining.\n#### 24",
        "original_answer": 24.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Bill gives each of his children 3 apples, so since he has two children this is 3*2=6 apples.\nJill bakes 2 apple pies, using 10 apples each so this means she uses 10*2=20 apples.\nIn total, this means 20+6=26 apples were used.\nSince Bill began with 50 apples, this means there are 50-20=30 apples remaining.\n#### 30",

        "wrong_type": "referencing_previous_step_value_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references 26 as 20 from step 3 and changes 50-26=24 to 50-20=30. It should be noted that step 3 in the transformed_solution <In total, this means 20+6=26 apples were used.> should be the same as the step 3 in the original_solution <In total, this means 20+6=26 apples were used.> and calculates its result 26 correctly. The erroneous reference in step 4 impacts only the final result, thus introducing a single error. The wrong referencing means that although step 3 is calculated correctly, it is not taken into account accurately in step 4, resulting in an incorrect total of 30 apples remaining instead of the correct 24. All other steps correctly follow from their preceding steps, maintaining the requirement of a single error in the transformed solution.",
        "eval_result": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the number of apples that Bill has left.\nLet's break down the information given:\nNumber of apples given to each child: 3\nNumber of children: 2\nNumber of apples used for the apple pies: 20\nNumber of apple pies: 2\nTotal number of apples used: 26\nTotal number of apples remaining: 30\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\nTotal number of apples - Total number of apples used = Total number of apples remaining\n50 - 26 = 30\nLet's simplify and solve for x:\n24 = 30\nTo solve for x, we can see that the equation is not true. Therefore, there must be an error in the given solution.\nThe solution is incorrect, and the correct answer is 24.The answer is: 24"
