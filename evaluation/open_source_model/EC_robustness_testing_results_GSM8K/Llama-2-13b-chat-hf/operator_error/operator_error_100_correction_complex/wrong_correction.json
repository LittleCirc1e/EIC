        "question": "There are 6 girls and 8 boys in the school play. If both parents of each kid attend the premiere, how many parents will be in the auditorium?",

        "original_answer": 28.0,
        "transformed_solution": "There are 6 / 8 = 0.75 kids in the school play.\nEach child has 2 parents attending the play and therefore there are 0.75 x 2 = 1.5 parents in the auditorium.\n#### 1.5",

        "explanation": "This example changes the addition operator in step 1 to a division operator, altering the expression from 6 + 8 = 14 to 6 / 8 = 0.75. The correct calculation is then performed using the transformed expression, resulting in 0.75 kids in the play. This incorrect number of kids then affects the calculation in the subsequent step, changing the number of parents from 14 x 2 = 28 to 0.75 x 2 = 1.5. All other aspects of each step are correct except for the erroneous operator change in step 1.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 12, and the explanation is that step 2 first makes a mistake in unit conversion and mistakenly believes that one child has 0.75 parents instead of 2 parents, calculating 0.75 x 2 = 1.5 instead of 6 x 2 = 12. The subsequent step 3 references the result of step 2, calculating 1.5 x 2 = 3 instead of 12 x 2 = 24. The subsequent step 4 references the result of step 3, calculating 3 + 3 = 6 instead of 24 + 24 = 48. The final incorrect answer is 6 instead of 48."

        "question": "Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?",
        "original_solution": "Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $2 on the jogger jeans.\nSo, he saved $6 - $2 = $4 on the tattered jeans.\nThe original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.\nCole bought the tattered jeans for $28\nHence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.\nTherefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $8 more than the tattered jeans.\n#### 8",

However, the revised savings calculation in step 5, $28 + $8 = $36, leads to the changed conclusion in step 6, stating that jogger jeans originally cost $36 - $24 = $12 more than the tattered jeans instead of $8.

The calculation for the total number of unsold books then becomes 800 - 2940 = -2140, which is an incorrect number because you cannot have a negative number of books unsold.
