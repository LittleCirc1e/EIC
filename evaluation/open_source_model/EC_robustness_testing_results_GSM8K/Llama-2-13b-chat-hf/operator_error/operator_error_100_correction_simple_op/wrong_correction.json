        "question": "A local college is offering German lessons and currently has 8 students enrolled. Through advertising, 8 more became interested but a fourth of these dropped out within a day. 2 more got frustrated and left. The class then rallied to show how simple the course actually is and increased enrollment by 5 times the amount of students already enrolled in the class, but 2 had to drop it because of scheduling conflicts. After one last rally, 6 more people enrolled. As the days passed, half of the class eventually dropped, and half of the remaining students graduated. How many are still enrolled?",
        "original_solution": "8+8=16 students are enrolled in the German class.\n8*.25=2 dropped out from the new recruits.\n2 more left, so the class had 16-2-2=12 students left.\nThere were 12*5+12=72 total students in the class after the rally.\nTwo people had to drop the class, so there were 72-2=70 left.\n70+6=76 were enrolled after the final rally.\n76/2=38 are left after half the class dropped.\n38/2=19 are left after half the class graduated.\n#### 19",

        "explanation": "This transformation changes the subtraction operation in step 5 to multiplication, incorrectly increasing the number of students from \"72-2=70\" to \"72*2=144\". This error impacts all subsequent calculations with the incorrect number of students, such as the final rally enrollment going from \"70+6=76\" to \"144+6=150\", and eventually leading to a different final count of enrolled students after half drop and half graduate, \"38/2=19\" becomes \"75/2=37.5\". All other steps and calculations are performed correctly, but they all rely on the incorrect figure produced in the transformed step 5.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 37, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nIn the first step, the solution correctly calculates the number of students enrolled after the first rally: 16 + 12 = 28.\n\nHowever, in the second step, the solution incorrectly calculates the number of students who dropped out after the second rally. The correct calculation is 28 * 0.25 = 7, not 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of students left after the second rally is 28 - 7 = 21, not 12.\n\nIn the final step, the solution correctly calculates the number of students enrolled after the final rally: 21 + 6 = 27.\n\nHowever, the solution incorrectly calculates the number of students who dropped out after half the class dropped. The correct calculation is 27 / 2 = 13.5, not 37.5.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 37, not 37.5."

This affects the subsequent related step 4, where the combined number of seahorses turns from 6 + 3 = 9 into 6 + 18 = 24. The final step which sums up all the fish changes accordingly from 15 + 9 + 8 = 32 into 15 + 24 + 8 = 47, leading to a different total number of caught fish.

        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 45, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nIn the first step, Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. However, this step contains an error, as the subtraction should be done before the addition, not after. Therefore, the correct calculation for the number of starfish caught by Locsin is 10 - 5 = 5, not 10 + 5 = 15.\n\nAdditionally, in the third step, the calculation for the number of clownfish caught by Locsin is incorrect. Locsin caught 3 more clownfish than Anakin, so the correct calculation is 3 + 2 = 5, not 3 + 2 = 8.\n\nTherefore, the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin is 5 + 24 + 5 = 45, not 47."

The single step that has been modified is only the operator in step 3, but it is calculated correctly, which leads to a different result from the original answer, affecting subsequent related steps. The number of rebates affects the job applications as well (step 4 changes from \"2 * 5 = 10\" to \"2 * 1 = 2\"), and subsequently also changes the total number of mail pieces to send (step 5 changes from \"3 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 20\" to \"3 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 8\"). The last step (step 6) adds an extra stamp for the electric bill, changing from \"20 + 1 = 21\" to \"8 + 1 = 9\" stamps needed.

This error propagates to the subsequent steps, leading to the final incorrect answer of 9 stamps.\n\nThe correct answer is 8 stamps, as Valerie needs 3 stamps for the thank you cards, 2 stamps for the bills, and 1 stamp for each of the 2 job applications, for a total of 8 stamps."
