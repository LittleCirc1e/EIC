        "question": "A local college is offering German lessons and currently has 8 students enrolled. Through advertising, 8 more became interested but a fourth of these dropped out within a day. 2 more got frustrated and left. The class then rallied to show how simple the course actually is and increased enrollment by 5 times the amount of students already enrolled in the class, but 2 had to drop it because of scheduling conflicts. After one last rally, 6 more people enrolled. As the days passed, half of the class eventually dropped, and half of the remaining students graduated. How many are still enrolled?",
        "original_solution": "8+8=16 students are enrolled in the German class.\n8*.25=2 dropped out from the new recruits.\n2 more left, so the class had 16-2-2=12 students left.\nThere were 12*5+12=72 total students in the class after the rally.\nTwo people had to drop the class, so there were 72-2=70 left.\n70+6=76 were enrolled after the final rally.\n76/2=38 are left after half the class dropped.\n38/2=19 are left after half the class graduated.\n#### 19",

        "explanation": "This transformation changes the subtraction operation in step 5 to multiplication, incorrectly increasing the number of students from \"72-2=70\" to \"72*2=144\". This error impacts all subsequent calculations with the incorrect number of students, such as the final rally enrollment going from \"70+6=76\" to \"144+6=150\", and eventually leading to a different final count of enrolled students after half drop and half graduate, \"38/2=19\" becomes \"75/2=37.5\". All other steps and calculations are performed correctly, but they all rely on the incorrect figure produced in the transformed step 5.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 37, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nThe first step where the mistake occurs is the calculation of the number of students left after the first rally: 12*5+12=72. This calculation is incorrect because the multiplication should be done before adding, not after. The correct calculation is 12*5=60+12=72.\n\nTherefore, the number of students left after the first rally is 72-2=70, not 12. The rest of the solution is correct, but the mistake in this step propagates to the final answer.\n\nThe final answer should be 70/2=35, not 37.5."

        "question": "Jenny signs up for dinner theater with 5 of her friends. Each person pays $50 for the ticket and $10 for their entrée, and half the people also buy unlimited drink tickets for $30/person. Then the dinner theater is canceled due to COVID, and each person gets a 90% refund. How much money did the group of six friends lose?",
        "original_solution": "First find the cost of the ticket and the entrée for each person: $50/person + $10/person = $60/person\nThen multiply that cost by the number of people to find the total cost of entrees and tickets: $60/person * 6 people = $360\nNow find how many people ordered drink tickets: 6 people / 2 = 3 people\nNow find the total cost of the drink tickets: 3 people * $30/person = $90\nNow find the total cost of the evening: $90 + $360 = $450\nNow multiply this quantity by 90% to find the amount of the refund: $450 * .9 = $405\nNow subtract the refund amount from the total cost to find how much money the friends lost: $450 - $405 = $45\n#### 45",

        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example transforms the division operator in step 3 into multiplication, by changing 6 people / 2 = 3 people to 6 people * 2 = 12 people. This affects the subsequent related step 4, 5, 6, and 7. Step 4 changes from 3 people * $30/person = $90 to 12 people * $30/person = $360. Step 5 changes from $90 + $360 = $450 to $360 + $360 = $720. Step 6 changes from $450 * .9 = $405 to $720 * .9 = $648. Step 7 changes from $450 - $405 = $45 to $720 - $648 = $72. It should be noted that only the operator in step 3 is incorrect, and its calculation is correct, which leads to its result being incorrect. This affects the subsequent steps of using its results, but all the calculation of the steps affected by step 3 is correct.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #4, which is $72.\n\nThe explanation is as follows:\n\nThe first step that makes a mistake is the calculation of the total cost of the drink tickets. The correct calculation should be 12 people * $30/person = $360, not $360\\*2 = $360. This mistake affects the subsequent steps that reference the results of the drink tickets, leading to the final wrong answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $72, which is the difference between the total cost of the evening ($720) and the refund amount ($648)."
