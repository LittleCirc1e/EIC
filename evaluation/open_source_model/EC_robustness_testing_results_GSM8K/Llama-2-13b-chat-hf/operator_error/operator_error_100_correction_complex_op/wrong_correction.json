The correct calculation is then performed using the transformed expression, resulting in 0.75 kids in the play. This incorrect number of kids then affects the calculation in the subsequent step, changing the number of parents from 14 x 2 = 28 to 0.75 x 2 = 1.5. All other aspects of each step are correct except for the erroneous operator change in step 1.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 12, and the explanation is that the operator in step 2 encounters an error, division should be used instead of multiplication. It miscalculates 6/8=0.75 instead of 6/8=1/2. This affects step 3. Step 3 incorrectly calculates 0.75x2=1.5 instead of 1/2x2=1. This leads to the final incorrect result.\n\nThe correct solution is:\nThere are 6 girls and 8 boys in the school play. If both parents of each kid attend the premiere, how many parents will be in the auditorium?\n\nAnswer: 6 x 2 + 8 x 2 = 12 + 16 = 28\n\nExplanation:\nThere are 6 girls and 8 boys in the school play, and each child has 2 parents attending the play. Therefore, the total number of parents attending the play is 6 x 2 + 8 x 2 = 12 + 16 = 28."
