        "question": "Carson is going to spend 4 hours at a carnival. The wait for the roller coaster is 30 minutes, the wait for the tilt-a-whirl is 60 minutes, and the wait for the giant slide is 15 minutes. If Carson rides the roller coaster 4 times and the tilt-a-whirl once, how many times can he ride the giant slide? (Wait times include the time actually spent on the ride.)",
        "original_solution": "First figure out how many minutes Carson spends at the carnival by multiplying the number of hours he's there by the number of minutes per hour: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes\nThen figure out how long Carson spends waiting for the roller coaster by multiplying the wait time per ride by the number of rides: 4 rides * 30 minutes/ride = 120 minutes\nNow subtract the time Carson spends on the roller coaster and tilt-a-whirl from the total time he spends at the park to find out how much time he has left: 240 minutes - 120 minutes - 60 minutes = 60 minutes\nNow divide the time Carson has left by the wait time for the giant slide to see how many times he can ride it: 60 minutes / 15 minutes/ride = 4 rides\n#### 4",

And it affects the subsequent related step 3 and 4. Step 3 changes from 240 minutes - 120 minutes - 60 minutes = 60 minutes to 200 minutes - 120 minutes - 60 minutes = 20 minutes. Step 4 changes from 60 minutes / 15 minutes/ride = 4 rides to 20 minutes / 15 minutes/ride = 1.33 rides.

        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 2, and the explanation is that step 4 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 200-120-60=20 instead of 200-120-60=140.
