        "question": "If a vehicle is driven 12 miles on Monday, 18 miles on Tuesday, and 21 miles on Wednesday. What is the average distance traveled per day?",
        "original_solution": "The total distance covered from Monday to Wednesday is 12 + 18 + 21 = 51 miles.\nSo the average distance traveled per day is 51/3 = 17 miles.\n#### 17",
        "original_answer": 17.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total distance covered from Monday to Wednesday is 12 + 18 + 21 = 51 miles.\nThe average distance traveled per day is counted as 51/2 = 25.5 miles because Wednesday is mistakenly excluded.\n#### 25.5",

        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 erroneously assumes the total distance covered should be divided by 2 days instead of 3, which means Wednesday is mistakenly excluded. Hence the average 51/3=17 changes to 51/2=25.5. The error is isolated to the counting of the number of days, and the previous step regarding the calculation of total distance remains unaffected.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 21.67, and the explanation is that step 3 first erroneously counts Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday as 3 days instead of 2 days, resulting in an error in the divisor in the formula. And step 3 calculates 51/3=17 instead of 51/2=25.5, resulting in the final incorrect answer."
