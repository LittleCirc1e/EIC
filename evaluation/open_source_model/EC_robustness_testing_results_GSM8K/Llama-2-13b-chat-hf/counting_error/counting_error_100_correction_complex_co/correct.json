        "question": "If a vehicle is driven 12 miles on Monday, 18 miles on Tuesday, and 21 miles on Wednesday. What is the average distance traveled per day?",
        "original_solution": "The total distance covered from Monday to Wednesday is 12 + 18 + 21 = 51 miles.\nSo the average distance traveled per day is 51/3 = 17 miles.\n#### 17",
        "original_answer": 17.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total distance covered from Monday to Wednesday is 12 + 18 + 21 = 51 miles.\nBut here we mistakenly consider that Monday to Wednesday counts as 2 days.\nSo the average distance traveled per day is 51/2 = 25.5 miles.\n#### 25.5",
        "transformed_answer": 25.5,
        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, we make a counting error by incorrectly considering the number of days from Monday to Wednesday as only 2 days instead of the actual 3 days. This error subsequently affects the calculation of the average distance, changing the correct operation 51/3 to the incorrect operation 51/2. It should be noted that this is a single counting error and the sum of the distances remains unchanged, as it is not part of the error.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 17, and the explanation is that step 4 first erroneously counts Monday to Wednesday as 2 days instead of 3 days, resulting in an error in the divisor in the formula. And step 4 calculates 51/2=25.5 instead of 51/3=17, resulting in the final incorrect answer."
