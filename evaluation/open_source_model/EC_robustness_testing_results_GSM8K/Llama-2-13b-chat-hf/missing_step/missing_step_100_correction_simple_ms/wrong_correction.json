        "question": "Loisa wants to buy a tablet that costs $450 cash. Since she does not have enough money, the store offered her an installment plan for 12 months. She will pay $100 as a down payment and pay $40 for the first 4 months; then $35 for the next four months; then $30 for the last four months. How much will Loisa save if she will buy the tablet in cash instead of on installment?",
        "original_solution": "Loisa will pay a total of $40 x 4 = $160 for the first 4 months.\nShe will pay a total of $35 x 4 = $140 for the next four months.\nAnd she will pay a total of $30 x 4 = $120 for the last four months.\nThus, she will pay a total of $100 + $160 + $140 + $120 = $520 for 12 months including the down payment.\nTherefore, Loisa can save $520 - $450 = $70 if she buys the tablet in cash.\n#### 70",

        "explanation": "This example removes the intermediate step 2 from the original_solution, which calculates the total cost of the tablet for the next four months. After removing this step, step 3 of the transformed_solution makes an error by referencing the result $160 from step 1 again instead of the original $140 for the cost of the middle four months. Consequently, the result $540 incorrectly combines $160 twice instead of using $140. The impact of this error is carried forward in the next calculation, which then assesses the total savings as $540 - $450 = $90. The wrong_step is identified as step 3 because it is the first step that uses the incorrect cost reference from the deleted step in the original_solution.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is $100, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nThe given installment plan is for 12 months, and Loisa will pay $100 as a down payment. Therefore, the total amount she needs to pay is $450 - $100 = $350.\n\nSince Loisa will pay $160 for the first 4 months and $120 for the last 4 months, her total payment for 12 months will be $160 + $120 = $280.\n\nTherefore, Loisa can save $350 - $280 = $70 if she buys the tablet in cash instead of on installment.\n\nThe correct answer is $70, not $90."

Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam in the second round. Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam in the third round. Jeff got tired and only completed half the number of skips as Sam in the last round. If Sam skipped 16 times in each round, what is the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff?",
        "original_solution": "In round one, Jeff completed 16 - 1 = 15.\nIn round two, Jeff completed 16 - 3 = 13.\nIn round three, Jeff completed 16 + 4 = 20.\nIn round four, Jeff completed 16 / 2 = 8.\nJeff completed 15 + 13 + 20 + 8 = 56 skips in total.\nJeff skipped an average of 56 / 4 = 14 skips per round.\n#### 14",

        "explanation": "In this example, the first step is removed, which detailed how many skips Jeff completed in round one. Thus, step 4 should transition from referencing Jeff's skips in round one to directly referencing Sam's skips from the question. In round one, Jeff did 16 - 1 skips (15 skips), so the 15 is no longer calculated and 16 is used directly in the total computation instead. The updated formula is 'Jeff completed 16 + 13 + 20 + 8 = 57 skips in total.' This mistake modifies the rest of the calculations, leading to an altered total and average. In step 5, which previously added up Jeff's total skips, the number 15 from step 1 is replaced by 16, the number in the question, adjusting the total. This step becomes the new step 4 in the transformed_solution and is therefore the wrong_step where the first incorrect reference occurs.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 14, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nIn the second round, Jeff skipped 16 - 3 = 13, which is correct. However, in the third round, Jeff skipped 16 + 4 = 20, which is incorrect. The correct number of skips for Jeff in the third round should be 16 + 3 = 19.\n\nTherefore, the correct total number of skips for Jeff is 16 + 13 + 19 + 8 = 56, not 57. The average number of skips per round for Jeff is 56 / 4 = 14, not 14.25.\n\nThe missing step in the [Solution] is the correct number of skips for Jeff in the third round, which is 16 + 3 = 19, not 16 + 4 = 20."

        "question": "A man decides to try and do everything off his bucket list while he is still young and fit enough to finish it all. One of his goals was to climb the seven summits. He realizes first he has to get in shape to do it and it takes him 2 years of working out to get healthy enough to take up mountain climbing. He then spends twice that long learning how to be a technically proficient mountain climber. After that he starts with the simplest mountain on the list and climbs them all. He spends 5 months climbing each mountain. After that he takes 13 months learning to dive and dives through all the caves he wants in 2 years. How much time did it take to get through all these goals?",
        "original_solution": "He spent 2*2=4 years learning to climb\nHe spends 5*7=35 months climbing all 7 mountains\nAfter a 13 month break, he starts diving so that is 35+13=48 months\nThat means it is 48/12=4 years\nSo in total it all took 2+4+4+2=12 years\n#### 12",

        "explanation": "In this example, the first step that calculates the time spent learning to climb is removed. Step 4 of the original_solution, which references the result '4 years' from the deleted Step 1, gets modified. The time spent preparing and learning to dive (2 years + 13 months) remains unaltered. However, since step 1 was removed, the total years cannot include the 4 years from the removed step. The new calculation in the transformed_solution should be the initial 2 years of working out, plus 4 years of mountaineering (calculated from the 48 months), plus 2 years of diving education, plus 2 years of actual diving, equaling 10 years in total. As per guidance given, the transformed solution has one less step compared to the original solution, and the wrong_step is the first one after the deletion that makes reference to the previous calculation ('2+4+4+2=12 years' changes to '2+4+2+2=10 years'), which is transformed step 4.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 8 years, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nThe solution has several errors. Firstly, the time spent climbing each mountain is not 5 months, but rather 5 years, as stated in the problem. This means that the total time spent climbing all 7 mountains is 5*7=35 years, not 35 months.\n\nSecondly, the time spent diving is not 13 months, but rather 13 years, as stated in the problem. This means that the total time spent diving through all the caves is 13*2=26 years.\n\nTherefore, the total time taken to complete all the goals is 35+26=61 years, not 10 years as stated in the solution. The correct answer is 8 years, which is the time taken to complete all the goals minus the time spent on other activities.\n\nThe root cause of the mistake in the solution is the incorrect assumption that the time spent climbing each mountain is only 5 months, and the time spent diving is only 13 months. This led to a series of errors in the calculation of the total time taken to complete all the goals."
