        "question": "Camden went swimming 16 times in March and Susannah went 24 times. If the number of times they went throughout the month was divided equally among 4 weeks, how many more times a week did Susannah swim than Camden?",
        "original_solution": "Camden went swimming 16/4 = 4 times a week\nSusannah went swimming 24/4 = 6 times a week\nSusannah went 6 - 4 = 2 more times a week than Camden\n#### 2",
        "original_answer": 2.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Susannah went swimming 24/4 = 6 times a week\nSusannah went 6 - 16 = -10 more times a week than Camden\n#### -10",

        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "missing_step",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example removes intermediate step 1. In the original_solution, step 1 references the number 16 from the question, and step 3 references the result 4 from step 1. Therefore, after deleting step 1, step 3 should reference the number 16 from the question and change the formula from 6 - 4 = 2 to 6 - 16 = -10, resulting in Susannah \"swimming\" -10 more times a week than Camden, which is logically incorrect since the frequency of swimming cannot be negative. However, as per the transformation rules, the logical correctness of the transformation is not under consideration. It is step 2 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 3 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing incorrect number in the transformed_solution based on the deletion, so the wrong_step is 2.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 5, and the explanation is that the first erroneous step is step 2, which directly divides the total number of times they went swimming by 4 without considering the fact that the number of weeks is not a whole number. There is a necessary step missing here to calculate the average number of times they went swimming per week by dividing the total number of times by the number of weeks plus one, which is (24+16)/4=5.67 instead of 24/4=6. This also affects the subsequent step 3, where -10 is calculated instead of 5.67-16=5.67-16=5. This also affects the final step 4, where 5.67 is calculated instead of 5.\n\nThe correct answer is 5, and the explanation is that Susannah swam 5 more times a week than Camden."

        "question": "A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars. For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40. On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires. How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?",
        "original_solution": "On Thursday the mechanic charged a total of 6*60 + 4*40 = $520.\nOn Friday the mechanic charged a total of 12*40 = $480.\nThus, on Thursday, the day with higher revenue, the mechanic had 520-480 = $40 more revenue than on Friday.\n#### 40",
        "original_answer": 40.0,
        "transformed_solution": "On Thursday the mechanic charged a total of 6*40 + 4*40 = $400.\nOn Friday the mechanic charged a total of 12*40 = $480.\nThus, on Thursday, the day with higher revenue, the mechanic had 400-480 = -$80 more revenue than on Friday.\n#### -80",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 has been modified to incorrectly calculate the revenue from truck tires by using the price for car tires. In the original_solution, step 1 correctly calculates the revenue for truck tires by using $60. However, in the transformed_solution, step 1 incorrectly uses the car tire price ($40) for the truck tires as well. The remaining steps reference the result of step 1. Therefore, after altering step 1, the revenue calculation for Thursday should be $400 (using 6*40 + 4*40), leading to an incorrect revenue comparison and a negative result for the difference in revenue, that is actually impossible considering the problem context. The transformed_solution's first step now uses the car tire price for the truck tires, changing the formula from 6*60 + 4*40 to 6*40 + 4*40 and resulting in a revenue of $400. The subsequent steps reflect this error with the final step comparing the incorrect calculations, resulting in $400 - $480 equaling -$80. The wrong step is 1 because it contains the first incorrect calculation referencing the wrong tire repair price.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is $480, and the explanation is that the first erroneous step is step 2, which directly adds up the revenue from truck tires and car tires without converting their respective prices to a common unit. There is a necessary step missing here to convert the price of each tire to a common unit, such as dollars per tire, which is $60 for truck tires and $40 for car tires. After obtaining the price per tire, perform a calculation of the total revenue for each day by multiplying the number of tires repaired by their respective prices.\n\nOn Thursday, the mechanic charged a total of (6 x $60) + (4 x $40) = $1200 + $160 = $1360.\n\nOn Friday, the mechanic charged a total of (12 x $40) = $480.\n\nTherefore, the mechanic earned $1360 - $480 = $880 more revenue on Thursday than on Friday."

        "original_solution": "Tom had 10 x 5 = 50 miniature racing cars.\nTom gave 50 x 1/5 = 10 miniature racing cars to each of his two nephews.\nSo, he gave a total of 10 x 2 = 20 cars to his two nephews.\nTherefore, Tom is left with 50 - 20 = 30 miniature racing cars.\n#### 30",
        "original_answer": 30.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Tom gave 10 x 1/5 = 2 miniature racing cars to each of his two nephews.\nSo, he gave a total of 2 x 2 = 4 cars to his two nephews.\nTherefore, Tom is left with 10 - 4 = 6 miniature racing cars.\n#### 6",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The intermediate step 1 of the original solution was removed. That step calculates the total number of miniature racing cars. After deleting it, step 2 should now reference the number of packages directly, but instead of using the correct total calculated earlier (50), it incorrectly assumes that each package has a quantity of 1 car (which is the largest number in the question referenced in step 1). As a result, this changes the operation from 50 x 1/5 to 10 x 1/5, which results in an incorrect calculation of the cars given to a nephew (2 instead of 10). Then, the next steps that depended on step 2 are also changed to maintain a logical (but incorrect) flow, adjusting the number of cars given away to 4 and finally concluding that Tom has 6 cars left. It is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 2 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing an incorrect number in the transformed_solution, thus the wrong_step is 1.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 6, and the explanation is that the first erroneous step is step 2, which directly adds up the number of packages and the number of cars in each package without considering the fraction of cars given to the nephews. There is a necessary step missing here to calculate the number of cars given to the nephews by multiplying the number of packages by the fraction of cars in each package, which is 10 x 1/5 = 2. Step 3 should calculate 10 - 2 = 8 instead of 10 - 4 = 6. This also affects the subsequent step 4, where an incorrect calculation of 10 - 4 = 6 instead of 8 - 4 = 4, resulting in the final erroneous result."
