        "question": "Out of the 80 students who took the biology exam, only 2/5 of them managed to score 100%. If a score below 80% qualified as failing, and 50 percent of the remaining students who didn't score 100% managed to score over 80%, calculate the number of students who failed the exam.",
        "original_solution": "The number of students who scored 100% is 2/5*80 = 32\nOut of the 80 students, 80-32 = 48 did not score 100%.\nIf 50% of the students who did not score 100% managed to score over 80%, then 50/100*48 =24 students scored over 80%\nThe number of students who failed is 48-24 = 24\n#### 24",
        "original_answer": 24.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The number of students who scored 100% is 2/5*80 = 32\nOut of the 80 students, 80-32 = 48 did not score 100%.\nIf 50% of the students who did not score 100% managed to score over 80%, then 50/100*48 = 23 students scored over 80%\nThe number of students who failed is 48-23 = 25\n#### 25",

        "wrong_step": 3,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this example, the calculation of 50/100*48 has been changed to result in 23 instead of 24. This is a calculation error introduced in step 3. As a result, the number of students who failed (step 4) will be based on this incorrect number. Therefore, step 4 has been modified to adjust for the change in step 3, updating the calculation to 48-23 = 25, which becomes the transformed answer. Only one calculation error has been introduced and it has correctly affected the subsequent step without altering the previous steps or unrelated parts of the solution.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 28, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nIn the first step, the calculation 2/5*80 is correct, and the result is 32. However, in the second step, the calculation 80-32 is incorrect, and the result should be 48 instead of 40.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who scored over 80% is 50/100*48 = 28, not 23.\n\nThe final answer is 28 students failed the exam."
