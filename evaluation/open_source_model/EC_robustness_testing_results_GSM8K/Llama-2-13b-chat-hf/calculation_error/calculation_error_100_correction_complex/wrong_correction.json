        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 630, and the explanation is that step 2 first makes a mistake in unit conversion and mistakenly believes that one parent has 20% instead of 20/100, calculating 800 x 20/100 = 160 instead of 800 x 20/100 = 160. The subsequent step 3 references the result of step 2, calculating 800 - 160 = 630 instead of 800 - 160 = 640. The subsequent step 4 references the result of step 3, calculating 630 instead of 640. Therefore, the final incorrect answer is 630."

This wrong calculation affects step 5, where originally the total for two months is calculated as 2000 x 2 = 4000.
