Store A lists the smartphone at a full price of $125 and offers an additional discount of 8%.  Store B lists the same smartphone for $130 and offers an additional discount of 10%.  After both stores' discounts are applied, how much cheaper is store A's smartphone than store B's smartphone?",
        "original_solution": "Store A has a $125 x 8/100 = $10 discount.\nSo the smartphone from store A will only cost $125 - $10 = $115.\nStore B has a $130 x 10/100 = $13 discount.\nSo the smartphone from store B will only cost $130 - $13 = $117.\nThus, store A's smartphone is $117 - $115 = $2 cheaper than that of store B.\n#### 2",

        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, the calculation in step 4 of the original solution is changed. The original correct calculation of $130 - $13 = $117 is improperly calculated as $130 - $13 = $120. This results in an incorrect final answer. The subsequent step 5 uses this incorrect price from store B ($120 instead of $117) to compute the difference, $120 - $115 = $5, leading to an incorrect transformed answer of $5 instead of the original answer of $2. Steps 1, 2, and 3 remain unchanged as they are not affected by the modification in step 4. The error is only introduced at step 4.",

The subsequent step 5 references the result of step 4, calculating $115 - $10 = $105 instead of $112 - $13 = $100, resulting in the final incorrect answer."
