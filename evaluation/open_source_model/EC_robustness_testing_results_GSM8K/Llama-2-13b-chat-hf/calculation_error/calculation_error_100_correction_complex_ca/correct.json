        "question": "A convenience store sold 100 bags of chips in a month. In the first week, 15 bags of chips were sold. In the second week, thrice as many bags of chips were sold. There was an equal number of chips sold in the third and fourth week. How many chips was each sold in the third and fourth week?",
        "original_solution": "In the second week, 15 x 3 = 45 bags of chips were sold.\nSo there was a total of 45 + 15 = 60 bags of chips sold on the first and second week.\nThus, a total of 100 - 60 = 40 bags of chips were sold on the third and fourth week.\nTherefore, 40/2 = 20 bags of chips were each sold on the third and fourth week.\n#### 20",
        "original_answer": 20.0,
        "transformed_solution": "In the second week, 15 x 3 = 45 bags of chips were sold.\nSo there was a total of 45 + 15 = 60 bags of chips sold on the first and second week.\nThus, a total of 100 - 60 = 50 bags of chips were sold on the third and fourth week.\nTherefore, 50/2 = 25 bags of chips were each sold on the third and fourth week.\n#### 25",

        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates 100 - 60 as 50 instead of 100 - 60 as 40 in step 3, which affects the subsequent step 4 related to it. Step 4 then inherits the error from step 3, not only modifying the formula 40/2 to 50/2 but also modifying the language description from <40 bags of chips were sold on the third and fourth week> to <50 bags of chips were sold on the third and fourth week>. The result of the calculation in the subsequent related step 4 changes to 25 bags of chips each on the third and fourth week from the initial 20 bags of chips each, due to the propagated error from the wrong step 3. The previous steps 1 and 2 remain unchanged as they are not affected by this error.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 20, and the explanation is that step 4 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 100-60=50 instead of 100-60=40, resulting in the final incorrect answer.\n\nIn the second week, 15 x 3 = 45 bags of chips were sold, and there was a total of 45 + 15 = 60 bags of chips sold on the first and second week.\n\nThus, a total of 100 - 60 = 40 bags of chips were sold on the third and fourth week.\n\nTherefore, 40/2 = 20 bags of chips were each sold on the third and fourth week.\n\nThe correct answer is 20, and the explanation is that the calculation error occurred in step 4, where the total number of chips sold on the first and second week was calculated as 60 instead of 40, leading to the final incorrect answer."
