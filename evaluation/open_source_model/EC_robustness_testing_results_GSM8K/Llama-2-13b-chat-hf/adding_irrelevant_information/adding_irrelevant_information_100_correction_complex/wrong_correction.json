        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 42,000, and the explanation is that step 3 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 12,000 + 24,000 + 5,000 = 41,000 instead of 12,000 + 24,000 + 5,000 = 42,000."

He also gave a cupcake to each of the 16 students in Mrs. Donnelly's class. He also gave a cupcake to Ms. Delmont, Mrs. Donnelly, the school nurse, and the school principal. How many cupcakes did he have left over?",
