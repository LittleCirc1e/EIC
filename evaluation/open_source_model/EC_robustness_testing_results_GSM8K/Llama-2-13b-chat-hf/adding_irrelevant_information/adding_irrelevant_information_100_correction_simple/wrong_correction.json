        "transformed_solution": "Mom bought things that cost: 4 + 4 + 2 + 6 + 11 = €27.\nBecause she also bought a loaf of bread for €3, so she has 55 - 27 - 3 = €25 left.\n#### 25",

The transformed_answer becomes €25 instead of the original €28 as a result of this additional expense.

        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #11, which is the cost of the chicken. The explanation is that the calculation of the cost of the chicken is incorrect, it should be €11 instead of €6. The correct solution is:\n\nMom bought things that cost: 4 + 4 + 2 + 11 = €29.\nBecause she also bought a loaf of bread for €3, so she has 55 - 29 - 3 = €13 left.\n\n#### 13."
