        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 4 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <Because one cat had a litter of kittens, adding 4 more cats>, resulting in step 4 changing from 10+10=20 cats in the shelter in the original_solution to 20+4=24 cats in the shelter in the transformed_solution. Subsequent steps are affected, changing the number of dogs that showed up from 40 to 48, and thus the total animal count from 60 to 72.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 72, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nThe first mistake in the solution is in the second step, where it is written \"5*2=10 more cats were added.\" This is incorrect, as the multiplication of 5 and 2 does not equal 10. Instead, it should be written as \"5*2=10 cats were added.\"\n\nAdditionally, in the third step, it is written \"This makes 10+10=20 cats in the shelter.\" This is incorrect, as the addition of 10 and 10 does not equal 20. Instead, it should be written as \"This makes 10+10=20 cats in the shelter.\"\n\nFinally, in the last step, it is written \"There are now 24+48=72 animals in the shelter.\" This is incorrect, as the addition of 24 and 48 does not equal 72. Instead, it should be written as \"There are now 24+48=72 animals in the shelter.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 72, and the solution is incorrect due to the multiple errors in the steps."
