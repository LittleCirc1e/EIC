The correct formula for the area of a rectangle is A = L x W, where L is the length and W is the width. In step 2, the formula A = L + W is used instead, which leads to a mistake in the calculation of the width.\n\nThe correct calculation for the width is W = (100 - L) / 4, which gives W = 25 m. The length is then L = 4W = 4(25) = 100 m.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 40 m for the length of the rectangle, and the final answer is 40 m x 25 m = 1000 m2."

That means, it should calculate 40 cm * 50 cm = 2000 cm^2 instead of 40 cm + 50 cm + 40 cm + 50 cm = 2000 cm.

        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect. The correct answer is 207.2727 square feet. The explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 confuses the perimeter and area formulas of rectangle and it should calculate the area of the rectangle which is equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the length plus length plus width plus width, equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle. That means, it should calculate 8 ft. * 4 ft. = 32 sq. ft. instead of 8 ft. + 4 ft. + 8 ft. + 4 ft. = 24 sq. ft. Step 5 and 7, as the subsequent steps of step 2, reference the wrong result of step 2, resulting in the incorrect final answer. Step 5 miscalculates 480 sq. ft. instead of 32 sq. ft.
