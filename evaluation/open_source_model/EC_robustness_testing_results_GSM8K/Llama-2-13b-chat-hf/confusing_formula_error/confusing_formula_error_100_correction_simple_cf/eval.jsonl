The correct answer is 170.\n\nThe error in the solution occurs in the first step, where the surface area of each carton is calculated. The formula used is incorrect, confusing the rectangular area formula with the rectangular perimeter formula. The correct formula for the surface area of a rectangular carton is A = 2(l + w + h), not A = 2*(l + w + h)^2.\n\nUsing the correct formula, we get:\n\nA = 2(4 + 4 + 5) = 2(12) = 24\n\nTherefore, the total number of cartons that will fit in each shipping box is:\n\n8000 / 24 = 333.33\n\nSince there are 3 widgets in each carton, the total number of widgets in each box will be:\n\n333.33 x 3 = 999.99\n\nThe correct answer is 170, which is the total number of widgets in each shipping box."}

The correct formula to use is the perimeter formula, which is 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width. In this case, the length is 225 feet and the width is 125 feet, so the perimeter is 2(225 + 125) = 2(350) = 700 feet.\n\nMinus the two gates, Bob will need at least 700 - 3 - 10 = 697 feet of fencing.

The formula used in the original solution correctly applies the area formula for a square, which is the side length squared. However, the transformed solution incorrectly uses the perimeter formula, which is the sum of all sides, causing a confusion between area and perimeter. This leads to 40*40 = 1600 square inches being changed to 40+40+40+40 = 160 square inches in the transformed solution. Due to the change in area calculation, subsequent steps adjust the number of bags from 1600/80 = 20 to 160/80 = 2, and the total weight of sand from 20*30 = 600 pounds to 2*30 = 60 pounds.

The correct answer is 40 pounds.\n\nThe error in the solution is that the area of the sandbox is calculated incorrectly. The area of a square is found by multiplying the length of one side by itself, not by adding the lengths of all four sides. Therefore, the area of the sandbox is 40^2 = 1600 square inches, not 160 square inches as calculated in the solution.\n\nTo fill the sandbox completely, we need 1600/80 = 20 bags of sand, and each bag weighs 30 pounds, so the total weight of sand needed is 20*30 = 600 pounds. However, since we only need to fill the sandbox to an adequate depth, we can reduce the amount of sand needed. Assuming an adequate depth is 2 inches, we need 1600/2 = 800 cubic inches of sand. Since each bag of sand contains 80 cubic inches, we need 800/80 = 10 bags of sand. Therefore, the correct answer is 10*30 = 40 pounds of sand needed to fill the sandbox completely."}
