        "question": "Pria bought a new car that advertised an estimated gas mileage of 35 miles per gallon. The car has a 12-gallon tank. She filled her car full of gas and was able to drive a total of 372 miles. What was the difference, in miles per gallon, between Pria's mileage and the advertised mileage?",
        "original_solution": "Pria's car achieved a rate of 372 miles / 12 gallons = 31 miles per gallon.\nTherefore, it was a difference of 35 - 31 = 4 miles per gallon.\n#### 4",
        "original_answer": 4.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Pria's car achieved a rate of 372 miles / 12 gallons = 31 miles per gallon.\nTherefore, it was a difference of 35 - 30 = 5 miles per gallon.\n#### 5",

        "wrong_type": "referencing_previous_step_value_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 2 mistakenly references 31 as 30 from step 1 and changes 35 - 31 = 4 miles per gallon to 35 - 30 = 5 miles per gallon. It should be noted that step 1 in the transformed_solution <Pria's car achieved a rate of 372 miles / 12 gallons = 31 miles per gallon.> should be the same as the step 1 in the original_solution <Pria's car achieved a rate of 372 miles / 12 gallons = 31 miles per gallon.> and calculates its result 31 correctly. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all steps is still correct and all other steps that reference the result number still reference it correctly. The result of the transformed_solution should be different from that of the original_solution.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 4 miles per gallon, and the explanation is that step 3 first makes a mistake in unit conversion and mistakenly believes that one gallon has 12 miles instead of 10 miles, calculating 372 miles / 12 gallons = 31 miles per gallon instead of 372 miles / 10 gallons = 37 miles per gallon. The subsequent step 4 references the result of step 3, calculating 31 - 35 = -4 instead of 37 - 35 = 2. The subsequent step 5 references the result of step 4, calculating -4 / 3 = -1.33 instead of 2 / 3 = 2, resulting in the final incorrect answer."

Over the course of the day, he sold 10 bicycles and bought an additional 15 to fix up. On Saturday, he sold 12 bicycles and bought 8 more. And on Sunday, he sold 9 bicycles and bought 11 more.
