She already has written 2/5 of the multiple-choice and 1/3 of the problem-solving questions. How many more questions does she need to write for both multiple-choice and problem-solving?",
        "original_solution": "Meryll has written 35 questions x 2/5 = 14 multiple-choice questions.\nWhile she has written 15 questions x 1/3 = 5 problem-solving questions.\nThe total number of questions that Meryll has to write is 35 questions + 15 questions = 50 questions.\nMeryll has written a total of 14 questions + 5 questions = 19 questions.\nHence, she needs to write 50 questions - 19 questions = 31 questions more.\n#### 31",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references 19 as 20 from step 3 and changes 50 questions - 19 questions = 31 questions more to 50 questions - 20 questions = 30 questions more. It should be noted that step 3 in the transformed_solution <The total number of questions that Meryll has to write is 35 questions + 15 questions = 50 questions.> should be the same as the step 3 in the original_solution <The total number of questions that Meryll has to write is 35 questions + 15 questions = 50 questions.> and calculates its result 50 correctly. Step 4 affects the subsequent step 5 related to it, changing from 50 questions - 19 questions = 31 questions more to 50 questions - 20 questions = 30 questions more. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all steps starting from the wrong step and the ones following it is still correct.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 30, and the explanation is that step 4 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 35 + 15 = 50 instead of 35 + 15 = 45. The subsequent step 5 references the result of step 4, calculating 50 - 20 = 30 instead of 45 - 20 = 25. Therefore, the final incorrect answer is 30."
