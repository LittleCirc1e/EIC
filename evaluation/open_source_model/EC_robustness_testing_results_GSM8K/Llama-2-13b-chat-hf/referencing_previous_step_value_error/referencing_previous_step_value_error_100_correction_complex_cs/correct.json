She filled her car full of gas and was able to drive a total of 372 miles. What was the difference, in miles per gallon, between Pria's mileage and the advertised mileage?",
        "original_solution": "Pria's car achieved a rate of 372 miles / 12 gallons = 31 miles per gallon.\nTherefore, it was a difference of 35 - 31 = 4 miles per gallon.\n#### 4",
        "original_answer": 4.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Pria's car achieved a rate of 372 miles / 12 gallons = 31 miles per gallon.\nTherefore, it was a difference of 35 - 30 = 5 miles per gallon.\n#### 5",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 2 mistakenly references 31 as 30 from step 1 and changes 35 - 31 = 4 miles per gallon to 35 - 30 = 5 miles per gallon. It should be noted that step 1 in the transformed_solution <Pria's car achieved a rate of 372 miles / 12 gallons = 31 miles per gallon.> should be the same as the step 1 in the original_solution <Pria's car achieved a rate of 372 miles / 12 gallons = 31 miles per gallon.> and calculates its result 31 correctly. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all steps is still correct and all other steps that reference the result number still reference it correctly. The result of the transformed_solution should be different from that of the original_solution.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 4 miles per gallon, and the explanation is that step 3 first erroneously references the result 372 instead of 350 from step 1, resulting in the calculation of 372 / 12 = 31 instead of 350 / 12 = 30. This affects the calculation of 35 - 31 = 4 instead of 35 - 30 = 5 in step 4, resulting in an error in the final result."
