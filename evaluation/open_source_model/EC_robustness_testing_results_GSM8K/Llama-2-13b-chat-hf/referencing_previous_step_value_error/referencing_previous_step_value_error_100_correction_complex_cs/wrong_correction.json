        "question": "Louise is an artist and needs to apply a coat of varnish to her latest paintings. Usually it takes 7 minutes for the coat of varnish to dry on one painting. However, today she is using a new varnish and it takes 12 minutes for the coat to dry. How much longer will it take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish?",
        "original_solution": "Usually, the varnish on all 6 paintings would be dry in 7*6=42 minutes\nWith the new varnish, all 6 paintings would be dry in 12*6=72 minutes\nWith the new varnish, it will take 72-42=30 more minutes\n#### 30",

        "explanation": "Step 3 mistakenly references 42 as 40 from step 1 and changes 72-42=30 more minutes to 72-40=32 more minutes. It should be noted that step 1 in the transformed_solution <Usually, the varnish on all 6 paintings would be dry in 7*6=42 minutes> should be the same as the step 1 in the original_solution <Usually, the varnish on all 6 paintings would be dry in 7*6=42 minutes> and calculates its result 42 correctly. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all steps is still correct.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 32, and the explanation is that step 3 first erroneously references the result 40 instead of 42 from step 1, resulting in the calculation of 72-40=32 instead of 72-42=30. And this causes an error in the final result."
