        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the formula for the area of a rectangle with the formula for its perimeter. The question asked for the area, which should be found by multiplying the length (L) by the width (W), but instead, the perimeter formula (L + W) was mistakenly used in the transformed_solution, which is typically the sum of all sides of the rectangle. As a result, the original solution's equation '100 = L * W' turned into '100 = L + W' in the transformed solution. This causes a chain reaction affecting the subsequent calculations. W is incorrectly found to be 20 instead of 5, and L is calculated as being 80 instead of 20. The previous steps and language remain unaltered, and the error results in a different final answer in the transformed_solution.",
