A third of the rest of it will have trellises for vining plants, and the rest will be devoted to raised beds. How big will the raised bed section of the garden be?",
        "original_solution": "The garden is 220 * 120 = 26,400 square feet.\nThe tilled land will take up half the area, and the trellises and raised beds will be the other half. Each half is 26,400 / 2 = 13,200 square feet.\nThe trellises will take up 1/3 of the remaining land, so the raised beds will take 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 of the remaining land.\nSo the total area of the raised bed area will be 13,200 square feet * (2 / 3) = 8,800 square feet.\n#### 8800",

As a result, all subsequent calculations based on the perimeter value are affected, yet the calculations using fractions of the original area remain correctly applied to the incorrect value.
