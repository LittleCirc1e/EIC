Therefore, after deleting step 2, step 5 should reference result 30 from step 1 instead of 15, changing the formula from 15 - 14 = 1 to 30 - 14 = 16 years old for Allison. Steps 6 and 7, as subsequent related steps, are affected by step 5. Step 6 changes the sum calculation of the ages from 46 + 1 = 47 to 46 + 16 = 62 years old.

        "explanation": "This example removes intermediate step 3. In the original_solution, step 3 calculates the hours Carl works per month by referencing the hours he works every day (6), which is found by subtracting 2 from the 8 hours Josh works a day in step 1. After deleting step 3, step 4 in the transformed_solution references the 160 hours from step 1 directly when calculating Carl's earnings. This simplifies Carl's monthly earnings calculation to 160 hours/month * $4.5/hour, which results in $720 per month for Carl. The transformed_solution combines steps 1 and 3 of the original_solution, assuming Carl works the same number of hours as Josh. The next step updates step 5 in the original_solution with the new combined total of $2160 instead of $1980. It is step 3 in the transformed_solution that serves as the first step referencing the incorrect number in the transformed_solution, hence the wrong_step is 3.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. The first wrong step is step #2, which is the assumption that Carl earns half of Josh's hourly wage. Carl actually earns $4.5 per hour, not half of $9 per hour. If this mistake is corrected, the calculation for Carl's monthly earnings would be $160 hours/month * $4.5/hour = $720 per month, which is the correct amount. Therefore, the company pays for the two together: $1440 + $720 = $2160."
