After deleting step 1, we update step 4 to exclude the $40 since it wouldn't be calculated due to the missing step 1. The updated step 4 uses the numbers from step 2 and step 3, computing $80 + $50 = $130 instead of including the additional $40 from the now-deleted step 1. This also influences step 5, changing the result for the amount needed to reach the goal from $200 - $170 = $30 to $200 - $130 = $70. It is step 1 of the transformed_solution, which is also step 4 in the original_solution, that no longer includes the $40 in the total, making it the wrong step.",

After removing this step, step 3 of the transformed_solution makes an error by referencing the result $160 from step 1 again instead of the original $140 for the cost of the middle four months.

Uncertain of how many pairs he had of each color, he began to sort his socks. He discovered that he had three more pairs of blue socks than he had pairs of black socks. He had one less pair of red socks than he had pairs of white socks. He had twice as many blue socks as he had of red socks. And he counted a total of 6 red socks.

After deleting this step, step 5 instantaneously refers to the number of blue socks pairs by dividing by 2 (since 1 pair equals 2 socks), which changes the formula from 6-3=3 pairs of black socks to 6/2-3=0 pairs of black socks. The change leads to calculating 0 black socks instead of 6, and the remaining steps that calculate the total number of socks refer to this new value. Therefore, removing step 4 causes a fundamental miscalculation in the number of black socks, leading to the first erroneous reference at step 5 in the transformed solution. It should be noted that the number 3 from step 5, referring to how many fewer pairs of black socks there are compared to blue, remains intact as the required reference from the question. The transformed answer, 22, is different from the original answer, which was 28, showing the impact of the error.",
