        "question": "Milly is figuring out how long she needs to spend studying. She knows that her math homework will take 60 minutes. Her geography homework will take half as long as her math homework, and her science homework will take time equal to the mean amount of time she spent studying math and geography. How many minutes does Milly spend studying?",
        "original_solution": "First find how long Milly spends studying geography by dividing her math homework time by 2: 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes.\nNow find the total amount of time Milly spent on math and geography: 30 minutes + 60 minutes = 90 minutes.\nNow calculate the mean amount of time Milly spends on math and geography by dividing the total time spent by the number of subjects, which is 2: 90 minutes / 2 = 45 minutes.\nNow add the time Milly spent on all three subjects to find the total: 45 minutes + 30 minutes + 60 minutes = 135 minutes.\n#### 135",

        "transformed_solution": "Find the total amount of time Milly spent on math and geography [combining step 1 and 2]: 60 minutes + (60 minutes / 2) = 90 minutes.\nNow calculate the mean amount of time Milly spends on math and geography by dividing the total time spent by the number of subjects, which is 2: 90 minutes / 2 = 45 minutes.\nNow add the time Milly spent on all three subjects to find the total: 45 minutes + (60 minutes / 2) + 60 minutes = 150 minutes.\n#### 150",

        "explanation": "In the transformed_solution, the original step 1 has been removed. Thus, the reference to \"30 minutes\" in the original step 2 for the time spent on geography has been removed. In the transformed_solution, the calculation that finds the time spent on geography by dividing math homework time by 2 (60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes) is integrated into step 1. Consequently, the initial calculation in step 3 of the original solution, which calculates the mean amount of time spent on math and geography, now references the recalculated total time spent on math and geography (90 minutes) from the transformed step 1. Step 2 of the transformed solution, which calculates the total study time, also integrates this change and incorrectly calculates the total study time as 150 minutes instead of the correct 135 minutes. By removing the first step, which was the calculation of the geography homework time, the subsequent steps reference the largest number from question that step 1 references, which is \"60 minutes\" for the math homework time, leading to the incorrect transformed_answer. Therefore, the wrong_step is 1.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. The first wrong step is step 2, because the formula for calculating the mean amount of time spent on math and geography is incorrect. The correct formula is: mean = (math + geography) / 2, not (math / 2) + (geography / 2). Therefore, the total time spent on math and geography is 90 minutes + 45 minutes = 135 minutes, not 150 minutes."

        "original_solution": "Josh works 8 hours/day * 5 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 hours a month.\nHe earns 160 hours/month * $9/month = $1440 per month.\nCarl works less because he is an intern: 6 hours/day * 5 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 120 hours per month.\nCarl earns 120 hours * $4.5/hour = $540 per month.\nThe company pays for the 2 together: $1440 + $540 = $1980.\n#### 1980",

        "explanation": "This example removes intermediate step 3. In the original_solution, step 3 calculates the hours Carl works per month by referencing the hours he works every day (6), which is found by subtracting 2 from the 8 hours Josh works a day in step 1. After deleting step 3, step 4 in the transformed_solution references the 160 hours from step 1 directly when calculating Carl's earnings. This simplifies Carl's monthly earnings calculation to 160 hours/month * $4.5/hour, which results in $720 per month for Carl. The transformed_solution combines steps 1 and 3 of the original_solution, assuming Carl works the same number of hours as Josh. The next step updates step 5 in the original_solution with the new combined total of $2160 instead of $1980. It is step 3 in the transformed_solution that serves as the first step referencing the incorrect number in the transformed_solution, hence the wrong_step is 3.",

The first wrong step is step #2, where Carl's hours are calculated as 2 hours less than Josh's hours, instead of 2 hours less than Carl's actual hours.

        "explanation": "This example removes intermediate step 3 about Phil collecting 1 coin every third month. This step references the result 4 from the calculation 12/3. Step 4 in the original_solution references the result from this deleted step 3. Therefore, after deleting step 3, step 4 should not include the 4 coins from step 3. The formula changes from 100+36+4 coins to 100+36 coins, which results in 136 coins before the loss. Subsequent steps 5 and 6 are about losing a quarter of the coins and hence will be modified based on the new total before the loss (136 instead of 140). So, step 5 changes from 140/4=35 coins to 136/4=34 coins, and step 6 changes from 140-35=105 coins to 136-34=102 coins. Step 2 in the transformed_solution references the incorrect total number of coins after the deletion of step 3, serving as the first step referencing an incorrect number.
