        "original_solution": "Each dog consumes 250 grams x 2 = 500 grams of dog food each day.\nSo, 4 dogs consume 500 grams x 4 = 2000 grams of dog food each day.\nSince there are 1000 grams in 1 kilogram, then the 4 dogs can consume 2000/1000 = 2 kilograms of dog food each day.\nAunt Gemma bought a total of 50 kilograms x 2 = 100 kilograms of dog food.\nHence, it will last 100 kilograms/2 kilograms = 50 days.\n#### 50",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this case, the incorrect unit conversion occurs in step 3 of the original_solution, where it was mistakenly assumed that there are 2000 grams in a kilogram instead of the correct 1000 grams. This changes the daily dog food consumption from 2 kilograms to 1 kilogram and as a result, the computed duration in days doubles from 50 to 100. The wrong step and its subsequent related steps are adjusted accordingly, while the previous steps and unrelated calculations remain unchanged.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 3, and the explanation is that step 3 makes an incorrect unit conversion, mistakenly assuming that 1 kilogram has 2000 grams instead of 1000 grams. This affects the calculation of the number of days the food will last. Specifically, step 3 erroneously calculates 2000 grams / 4 dogs = 500 grams per dog per day instead of 1000 grams / 4 dogs = 250 grams per dog per day. This leads to an overestimation of the number of days the food will last. The correct calculation is 100 kilograms / 4 dogs = 25 days. Therefore, the answer should be #25."
