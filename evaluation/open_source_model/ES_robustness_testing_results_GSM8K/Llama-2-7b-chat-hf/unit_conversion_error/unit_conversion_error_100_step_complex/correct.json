And it affects the subsequent related step 4, where the total time changes from 3+1 = 4 hours to 3+1.2 = 4.2 hours, and the final step 5 where the latest time the head baker can show up changes from 6-4 = 2:00 am to approximately 6-4.2 = 1:48 am (converted from decimal to time format). It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, so the other calculation processes are still correct.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 3, and the explanation is that step 3 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 15+30+15=60 instead of 15+30=45. The subsequent step 4 references the result of step 3, calculating 45/50=0.9 instead of 45/50=0.8, resulting in the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 3."
