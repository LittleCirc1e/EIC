        "original_solution": "He has 30*6=180 students\nSo he needs to buy 180*10=1800 index cards\nThat means he needs to buy 1800/50=36 packs of index cards\nSo he spends 36*3=$108\n#### 108",

        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, the division operation in step 3 has been changed to multiplication, turning 1800/50=36 into 1800*50=90000. This change affects the calculation of the number of packs of index cards needed. Consequently, the amount of money spent, which is calculated in step 4, is also wrongfully affected, changing from 36*3=$108 to 90000*3=$270,000. The error lies solely in the modification of the operator in step 3, but the calculation of 1800*50=90000 is done correctly. This operator error leads to incorrect subsequent steps that rely on its result; however, the calculations in those affected steps are performed accurately based on the altered formula.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 3, and the explanation is that the operator in step 3 encounters an error, multiplication should be used instead of addition. It miscalculates 30 x 6 = 180 instead of 30 x 10 = 300, resulting in an incorrect total number of index cards needed. This affects the calculation of the total number of index cards needed and the cost. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 3."

Step 7 incorrectly inherits this result, where it should calculate 60 American swallows carrying 300 pounds, but instead calculates 120 swallows supposedly carrying 600 pounds. This incorrect number of American swallows also affects step 8, erroneously adding a higher carrying capacity for 120 swallows instead of 60, thus giving an incorrect total of 900 pounds. It should be noted that the operator error in step 4 and the miscalculation that follows in steps 7 and 8 lead to the transformed solution being incorrect.",
