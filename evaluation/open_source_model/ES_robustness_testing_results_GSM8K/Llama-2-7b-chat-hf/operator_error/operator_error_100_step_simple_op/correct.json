        "explanation": "In the transformation, step 2 of the original solution mistakenly changes the multiplication operator to division, altering the original procedure of dividing Susan's apples by 2. Instead of correctly calculating the half as 108*(1/2), the erroneous step applies division as 108/(1/2), which mathematically results in doubling the number of apples. This leads to a negative count of apples since Susan cannot have fewer apples than she gives away. Consequently, all subsequent steps that depend on the result of this step are affected, although the arithmetic within those steps remains accurate.",

Therefore, the correct calculation is: Susan picked 108 apples, and she gave out half which is 108 / 2 = 54 apples. The final answer is 54 apples.\n\nExplanation: The error in the solution is the calculation of the number of apples Susan picked. The solution states that Susan picked 3 times as many apples as Frank, but this means that she picked 36 x 3 = 108 apples, not 36 x 2 = 72 apples. Therefore, the calculation of the number of apples Susan gave out is incorrect, and the final answer is also incorrect."

        "question": "Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?",
        "original_solution": "Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $2 on the jogger jeans.\nSo, he saved $6 - $2 = $4 on the tattered jeans.\nThe original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.\nCole bought the tattered jeans for $28\nHence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.\nTherefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $8 more than the tattered jeans.\n#### 8",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example changes the subtraction in step 2 to an addition, transforming $6 - $2 = $4 into $6 + $2 = $8. This affects subsequent related step 4 and step 5. Step 4 remains unchanged because no other steps affected the purchase price of the tattered jeans. However, the revised savings calculation in step 5, $28 + $8 = $36, leads to the changed conclusion in step 6, stating that jogger jeans originally cost $36 - $24 = $12 more than the tattered jeans instead of $8. Only the operator in step 2 is incorrect to induce the wrong conclusion, but its calculation is correct, as are the calculations of subsequent affected steps.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #2.\n\nThe solution states that Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $2 on the jogger jeans, but this is incorrect. According to the question, Cole saved a total of $6, not $2, on the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans. Therefore, the correct calculation for the savings on the jogger jeans is $6 x 1/3 = $2, not $2.\n\nThe solution also states that the original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24, but this is incorrect. According to the question, the original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $6 = $28, not $24. Therefore, the correct answer is that the original price of the jogger jeans is $28 - $24 = $4 more than the tattered jeans.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is #4."

Consequently, the amount of money spent, which is calculated in step 4, is also wrongfully affected, changing from 36*3=$108 to 90000*3=$270,000. The error lies solely in the modification of the operator in step 3, but the calculation of 1800*50=90000 is done correctly.
