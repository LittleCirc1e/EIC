        "original_solution": "If a box of tissue has 20 packs of tissues, ten boxes have 20 packs/box * 10 boxes = 200 packs\nSince each pack has 100 tissues, Annalise bought 100 tissues/pack * 200 packs = 20000 tissues.\nAnnalise bought 20000 tissues at five cents each, at a total cost of 20000 tissues * $0.05 = $1000\n#### 1000",

        "explanation": "This example changes the multiplication in step 1 to division, incorrectly calculating the total number of packs from the ten boxes by changing '20 packs/box * 10 boxes' to '20 packs/box / 10 boxes'. The correct number of packs should be 20 * 10=200 packs, but after changing the operation, it becomes 20 / 10=2 packs. This alteration affects the following calculations, where step 2 and 3 use the incorrect number of packs. The calculation within each incorrect step is performed correctly according to the modified operation, leading to a different (incorrect) transformed_answer compared to the original_answer.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. The first wrong step is step #2, where the calculation of 20 packs/box / 10 boxes = 2 packs is incorrect. The correct calculation is 20 packs/box / 10 boxes = 2 packs per box. Therefore, Annalise bought 20 packs of tissues per box, which is 200 tissues."

She also has to pay the water bill and the electric bill separately. She wants to send three more mail-in rebates than she does bills and she has twice as many job applications as rebates to mail. How many stamps does she need if everything needs 1 stamp except the electric bill, which needs 2?",
        "original_solution": "Valerie has to send a thank you card to each of 3 people, so she has 3 * 1 = 3 thank you cards to mail.\nShe has 2 bills to mail.\nShe has 3 more rebates than bills, so 3 + 2 = 5 mail-in rebates to mail.\nShe has twice as many job applications as rebates, so she has 2 * 5 = 10 applications to mail.\nShe has 3 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 20 pieces of mail to send.\nThe electric bill needs an extra stamp, so she needs 20 + 1 = 21 stamps.\n#### 21",

        "explanation": "The example modifies the addition in step 3 to subtraction, changing the formula \"3 + 2 = 5\" to \"3 - 2 = 1\". The single step that has been modified is only the operator in step 3, but it is calculated correctly, which leads to a different result from the original answer, affecting subsequent related steps. The number of rebates affects the job applications as well (step 4 changes from \"2 * 5 = 10\" to \"2 * 1 = 2\"), and subsequently also changes the total number of mail pieces to send (step 5 changes from \"3 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 20\" to \"3 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 8\"). The last step (step 6) adds an extra stamp for the electric bill, changing from \"20 + 1 = 21\" to \"8 + 1 = 9\" stamps needed. The explanation makes clear that only the operator in step 3 is incorrect, leading to its incorrect result and affecting subsequent calculations, which are however correctly performed with the modified values.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. The first wrong step is step #3, where Valerie has 3 more rebates than bills, but she should have 2 more rebates than bills. Therefore, the correct answer is 3 - 2 = 1 mail-in rebate to mail."
