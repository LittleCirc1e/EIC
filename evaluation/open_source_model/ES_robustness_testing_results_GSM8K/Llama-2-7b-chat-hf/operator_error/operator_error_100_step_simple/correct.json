Instead of correctly calculating the half as 108*(1/2), the erroneous step applies division as 108/(1/2), which mathematically results in doubling the number of apples.

This affects the subsequent related step 4, 5, 6, and 7. Step 4 changes from 3 people * $30/person = $90 to 12 people * $30/person = $360. Step 5 changes from $90 + $360 = $450 to $360 + $360 = $720.
