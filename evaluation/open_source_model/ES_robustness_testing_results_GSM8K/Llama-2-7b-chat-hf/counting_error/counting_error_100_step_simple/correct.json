        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #3, which must be an integer.\n\nThe explanation is: The solution states that Scott runs 6 miles every Thursday and Friday, but it does not take into account the fact that he also runs 3 miles every Monday through Wednesday. Therefore, the total miles run by Scott for a week from Monday through Wednesday is not 9 miles, but rather 3 x 3 = 9 miles."

The incorrect multiplication of 0.50 x 2 = 1.0 hours replaces the correct calculation of 0.50 x 3 = 1.5 hours. This affects the last step, changing the sum from 2.5 + 1.5 = 4 hours to 2.5 + 1.0 = 3.5 hours. The other calculations leading up to the erroneous step remain correct.",
