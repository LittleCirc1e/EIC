It did not rain on Wednesday but on Thursday it rained 1 inch. The biggest storm was on Friday when the total was equal to Monday through Thursday combined. What was the daily average rain total for the week?",
        "original_solution": "The total rain was 2 inches + 1 inches = 3 inches on Monday.\nThe total rain was 2 * 3 inches = 6 inches on Tuesday.\nThe total rain was 0 inches + 1 inch = 1 inch across Wednesday and Thursday.\nThe total rain was 3 inches + 6 inches + 1 inch = 10 inches on Friday.\nThere were 3 inches + 6 inches + 1 inch + 10 inches = 20 inches total last week.\n20 inches/5 days = 4 inches average daily rain.\n#### 4",

In the transformed_solution, the divisor has been mistakenly changed from 5 days to 4 days (Monday to Thursday), excluding Friday. This incorrect counting affects step 6, changing the average daily rain calculation from 20/5=4 inches to 20/4=5 inches, thus leading to a different transformed_answer.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 5, and the explanation is that step 5 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 20 inches / 4 days = 5 inches instead of 20 inches / 5 days = 4 inches.
