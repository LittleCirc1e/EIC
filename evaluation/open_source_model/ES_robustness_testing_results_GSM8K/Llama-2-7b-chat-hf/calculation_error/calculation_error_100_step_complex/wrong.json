This change goes on to impact step 2, which relies on the result of step 1 for its calculation. So, instead of the correct sum of 1200+120=$1320, after the change it is calculated as 1200+100=$1300. All other elements not reliant on step 1 remain unaffected, and the error is propagated to the sum in step 2, leading to a different total repayment amount of $1300.",
