        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #3, which must be an integer.\n\nThe explanation is: The solution assumes that Micah needs to buy 12 stamps for envelopes that weigh more than 5 pounds, but the question only states that if an envelope weighs more than 5 pounds, Micah will need 5 stamps. Therefore, the solution overestimates the number of stamps Micah needs for envelopes that weigh more than 5 pounds.\n\nTo fix the mistake, the solution should be: Micah needed to buy 6 envelopes."
