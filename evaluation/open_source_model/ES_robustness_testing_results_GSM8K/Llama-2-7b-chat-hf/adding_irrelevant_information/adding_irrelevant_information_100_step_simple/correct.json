        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #3.\n\nThe solution states that the first 3 pieces each cost $15,000, but this is incorrect. According to the question, John paid the same price for his first 3 pieces of art, so the cost of each piece must be the same. Therefore, the cost of the first 3 pieces is $45,000 / 3 = $15,000 each.\n\nThe solution also states that the next piece was 50% more expensive than those, but this is incorrect. According to the question, the next piece was 50% more expensive than the previous piece, not the previous 3 pieces. So the cost of the next piece is $15,000 + (50% of $15,000) = $15,000 + $7,500 = $22,500.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of all the art is $45,000 + $22,500 = $67,500.#### 67,500."
