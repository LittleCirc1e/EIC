        "explanation": "Step 2 references 4 in the question as 5 wrongly, and calculates 5 + 10 = 15 hours a week instead of 4 + 10 = 14 hours a week. Its subsequent related step will be affected, calculating 15 hours x 24 weeks = 360 hours on the course instead of 14 hours x 24 weeks = 336 hours. Please note that you should only consider one error, so step 3 still references 24 in the question correctly.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #2, which is the addition of 3 hours + 3 hours + 4 hours. The correct calculation is 3 hours + 3 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours in class each week. Therefore, David will spend 10 hours x 24 weeks = 240 hours on the course, not 360 hours.\n\nExplanation: The error in the solution is caused by the incorrect calculation of the total hours spent in class each week. The solution incorrectly adds 3 hours + 3 hours + 4 hours, resulting in an incorrect total."
