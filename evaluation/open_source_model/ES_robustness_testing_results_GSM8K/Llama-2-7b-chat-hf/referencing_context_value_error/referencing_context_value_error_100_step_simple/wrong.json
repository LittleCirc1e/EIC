He ordered a nice appetizer for $8, a delicious ribeye steak for his entrée at $20, had two glasses of nice red wine with dinner for $3 each, and a slice of caramel cheesecake for dessert for $6. He used a voucher for half off the price of his entrée, but he very thoughtfully tipped his waitress a full 20% of what the full cost of his meal would have been without the discount. How much, including the tip, did Arthur spend on dinner?",
