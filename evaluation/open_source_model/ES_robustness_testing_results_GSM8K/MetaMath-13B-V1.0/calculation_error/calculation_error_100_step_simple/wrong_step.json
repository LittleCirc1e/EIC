        "question": "A rival football team has won twice as many matches as the home team they will be playing did. If records show that the home team has won three matches, and each team drew four matches and lost none, how many matches have both teams played in total?",
        "original_solution": "The rival team won twice as many as the home team who won 3 matches so they won 2*3 = 6 matches\nThey both drew 4 matches each for a total of 2*4 = 8 matches\nThe total number of matches played is 3+6+8 = 17 matches\n#### 17",
        "original_answer": 17.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The rival team won twice as many as the home team who won 3 matches so they won 2*3 = 6 matches\nThey both drew 4 matches each for a total of 2*4 = 10 matches\nThe total number of matches played is 3+6+10 = 19 matches\n#### 19",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The example mistakenly calculates 2*4 as 10 instead of 2*4 as 8 in step 2, which results in the subsequent step 3 to inherit its error and affect its calculation. The previous or unrelated steps are not affected. Steps involved are only changed by inheriting the miscalculations, but the calculation methods themselves remain correct. So, step 3 is modified from 3+6+8 = 17 matches to 3+6+10 = 19 matches.",
        "eval_result": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the total number of matches played by both teams.\nLet's break down the information given:\nNumber of matches won by the home team: 3\nNumber of matches won by the rival team: 6\nNumber of matches drawn by both teams: 4 each\nTotal number of matches played: 19\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\nNumber of matches won by the home team + Number of matches won by the rival team + Number of matches drawn by both teams = Total number of matches played\n3 + 6 + 2 * 4 = 19\nLet's simplify and solve for x:\n3 + 6 + 8 = 19\n17 = 19\nSince the equation is not true, there must be an error in the given solution.\nTo determine the correct solution, we need to find the first step that made a mistake.\nIn the given solution, each step is represented by a number, and the number after #### represents the final answer.\nThe first step that made a mistake is step 3.\nTherefore, the correct solution is:\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 3, and the explanation is: 3\nThe value of x is 3.The answer is: 3"
