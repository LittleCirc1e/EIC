        "question": "In a classroom, 10 children have 7 books each. Their teacher brings another 8 books to the classroom. How many books are in the classroom altogether?",
        "original_solution": "At first, the children have 10*7=70 books\nWith their teacher, they have 70+8=78 books\n#### 78",
        "original_answer": 78.0,
        "transformed_solution": "At first, the children have 10*7=70 books\nAssuming a librarian brought in an extra 5 books for a special reading session, with their teacher and librarian, they have 70+8+5=83 books\n#### 83",
        "transformed_answer": 83.0,
        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "adding_irrelevant_information",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 2 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <Assuming a librarian brought in an extra 5 books for a special reading session>, resulting in step 2 changing from 70+8=78 books in the original_solution to 70+8+5=83 books in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct.",
        "eval_result": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the number of books in the classroom altogether.\nLet's break down the information given:\nNumber of children: 10\nNumber of books each child has: 7\nNumber of books brought by the teacher: 8\nNumber of books brought by the librarian: 5\nTotal number of books: 83\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\nNumber of children * Number of books each child has + Number of books brought by the teacher + Number of books brought by the librarian = Total number of books\n10 * 7 + 8 + 5 = 83\nLet's simplify and solve for x:\n70 + 8 + 5 = 83\n73 = 83\nSince the equation is not true, the given solution is incorrect.\nTo determine the correct solution, we need to find the first wrong step and identify the mistake.\nFrom the given solution, we can see that the first wrong step is adding irrelevant information, which means the first wrong step is the step that adds information that is not included in the question statement and affects the final result.\nTherefore, the correct solution is:\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 1, and the explanation is: 1\nThe value of x is 1.The answer is: 1"
