        "question": "To make a cherry pie, Veronica needs 3 pounds of pitted cherries. There are 80 single cherries in one pound of cherries. It takes 10 minutes to pit 20 cherries. How many hours will it take Veronica to pit all the cherries?",
        "original_solution": "There are 80 cherries in a pound and she needs 3 pounds to make a pie so she needs 80*3 = 240 cherries\nIt takes her 10 minutes to pit a unit of 20 cherries. She has 240/20 = 12 units of cherries to pit\nIt takes 10 minutes to pit a unit of cherries and she has 12 units so it will take her 10*12 = 120 minutes\n60 minutes are in 1 hour and it takes her 120 minutes so that’s 120/60 = 2 hours\n#### 2",

She has 240/20 = 12 units of cherries to pit\nIt takes 10 minutes to pit a unit of cherries and she has 12 units so it will take her 10*12 = 120 minutes\n50 minutes are in 1 hour and it takes her 120 minutes so that’s 120/50 = 2.4 hours\n#### 2.4",

        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 4 contains an incorrect unit conversion, erroneously stating that 50 minutes are in an hour instead of the correct 60 minutes. This error alters the computation from 120/60 = 2 hours in the original solution to 120/50 = 2.4 hours in the transformed solution. This error affects only the related unit conversion in the final step, while previous calculations remain unaffected.",
        "eval_result": "To determine if the [Solution] is correct, we need to check if the [Solution] matches the given information.\nThe [Solution] states that it takes Veronica 2.4 hours to pit all the cherries.\nWe know that there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so 2.4 hours is equal to 2.4 * 60 = 144 minutes.\nSince it takes Veronica 10 minutes to pit a unit of 20 cherries, we can calculate how many units she can pit in 144 minutes:\n144 minutes / 10 minutes per unit = 14 units\nSince each unit has 20 cherries, the total number of cherries she can pit in 144 minutes is:\n14 units * 20 cherries per unit = 280 cherries\nSince she needs 240 cherries to make a pie, we can conclude that the [Solution] is incorrect.\nThe correct [Solution] should be:\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 1, and the explanation is 240 cherries are needed to make a pie, but she only pitted 280 cherries, so she made a mistake in step 1.\n#### 1\nThe answer is: 1"
