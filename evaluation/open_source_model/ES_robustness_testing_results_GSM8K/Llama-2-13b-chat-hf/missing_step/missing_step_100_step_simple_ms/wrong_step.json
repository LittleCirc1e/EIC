        "question": "Loisa wants to buy a tablet that costs $450 cash. Since she does not have enough money, the store offered her an installment plan for 12 months. She will pay $100 as a down payment and pay $40 for the first 4 months; then $35 for the next four months; then $30 for the last four months. How much will Loisa save if she will buy the tablet in cash instead of on installment?",
        "original_solution": "Loisa will pay a total of $40 x 4 = $160 for the first 4 months.\nShe will pay a total of $35 x 4 = $140 for the next four months.\nAnd she will pay a total of $30 x 4 = $120 for the last four months.\nThus, she will pay a total of $100 + $160 + $140 + $120 = $520 for 12 months including the down payment.\nTherefore, Loisa can save $520 - $450 = $70 if she buys the tablet in cash.\n#### 70",

        "explanation": "This example removes the intermediate step 2 from the original_solution, which calculates the total cost of the tablet for the next four months. After removing this step, step 3 of the transformed_solution makes an error by referencing the result $160 from step 1 again instead of the original $140 for the cost of the middle four months. Consequently, the result $540 incorrectly combines $160 twice instead of using $140. The impact of this error is carried forward in the next calculation, which then assesses the total savings as $540 - $450 = $90. The wrong_step is identified as step 3 because it is the first step that uses the incorrect cost reference from the deleted step in the original_solution.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #4, which must be an integer, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nIn step #4, the calculation of the total amount paid for the last four months is incorrect. The correct calculation should be $30 x 4 = $120, not $35 x 4 = $140. Therefore, the total amount paid for 12 months including the down payment should be $100 + $160 + $120 = $480, not $540.\n\nSo, Loisa can save $480 - $450 = $30 if she buys the tablet in cash instead of on installment. The correct answer is $30."

        "original_solution": "If Marcus creates 2 paintings on the first day, then he can paint 2 paintings * 2 = 4 paintings on the 2nd day.\nSo he paints 4 paintings * 2 = 8 paintings on the 3rd day.\nHe then paints 8 paintings * 2 = 16 paintings on the 4th day.\nAnd finally paints 16 paintings * 2 = 32 paintings on the 5th day.\nMarcus therefore has painted a total of 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 paintings.\n#### 62",

        "explanation": "In this transformation, the first step has been removed. Since the first step is missing, we need to adjust the final summation step (original Step 5) to compensate for this removal. The original solution went through 5 steps to show the progression of paintings from Day 1 to Day 5. By removing the first day's 2 paintings and not adjusting the final sum to account for this absence, it results in an error in calculation. Specifically, the final sum should still be 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 as in the original solution. However, in the transformed step, the summation incorrectly doubles the calculated total to 124, which becomes the transformed_answer. Therefore, the wrong_step is the last remaining one (number 5 in the sequence of steps that have not been deleted), as it improperly adjusts for the missing step and incorrectly doubles the total count, showing a calculation error.",

This error leads to a total of 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30 paintings, which is incorrect.\n\nThe correct solution is:\n\nMarcus paints 2 paintings on the first day, then he paints 2 x 2 = 4 paintings on the second day, then he paints 2 x 4 = 8 paintings on the third day, and so on. Therefore, the total number of paintings Marcus will have painted in 5 days is:\n\n2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 paintings.\n\nThe correct answer is #124."

        "explanation": "By removing step 1, the second step needs to reference the amount Jake initially had ($5000) instead of the amount left after purchasing the motorcycle ($2200). Since the question states he spends half of what's left on a concert ticket, the remaining amount is referenced as half of the original amount ($5000) instead. The resulting number from the question ($5000) divides directly in half (5000/2 = $2500). Subsequent steps must then calculate the loss and the remaining money based on the new amount Jake has after spending on the concert ticket ($2500). Step 2 thus becomes \"Jake loses 2500/4 = $625\" and step 3 is updated accordingly to \"Jake has 2500-625 = $1875 left\".

This mistake leads to the next step, where Jake loses a fourth of what he has left, which is $1250 / 4 = $312.5, not $625. Therefore, the correct answer is $1875 - $312.5 = $1562.5, not $1875.\n\nThe solution is incorrect, and the first wrong step is step #2."
