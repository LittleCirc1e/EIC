        "question": "Jack and Jill shared the cost of renting a cottage that costs $5 an hour. If they rented it for eight hours, how much did each friend pay?",
        "original_solution": "The total cost of renting the cottage for 8 hours is $5 x 8 = $40.\nSo, each friend pay $40/2 = $20 each.\n#### 20",
        "original_answer": 20.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total cost of renting the cottage for 8 hours is $5 x 8 = $40.\nSo, each friend pay $40/2 = $15 each.\n#### 15",
        "transformed_answer": 15.0,
        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The transformation erroneously changes the calculation of $40/2 from $20 to $15 in step 2. No changes are made to step 1, as it is correct and not associated with the intentional error inserted into step 2. The wrong calculation in step 2 directly leads to the mistake in the final answer. The original answer was $20 each, and now the transformed answer is $15 each due to the intended error.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nPlease provide your response here.\n\nPlease note that the [Solution] is incorrect, and the first wrong step is step #3, which is the calculation of $40/2. The correct calculation should be $40/4 = $10 each.\n\nThe explanation is that the cost of renting the cottage for 8 hours is $40, and it should be divided equally among four friends, not two. Therefore, each friend should pay $10 each.\n\nThe solution is incorrect, and the first wrong step is step #3."
