        "question": "A pad of paper comes with 60 sheets. Evelyn uses a pad of paper writing notes at work every week. She takes Monday and Friday off from work. How many sheets of paper does she use per day at work?",
        "original_solution": "Evelyn takes two days a week off from work, so she is at work 7 - 2 = 5 days a week.\nThus, she uses 60 / 5 = 12 sheets of paper per day at work.\n#### 12",
        "original_answer": 12.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Evelyn takes two days a week off from work, so she is at work 7 - 1 = 6 days a week.\nThus, she uses 60 / 6 = 10 sheets of paper per day at work.\n#### 10",

        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 mistakenly counts the number of off days as 1 instead of 2. This affects the subsequent steps, changing the calculation from 7 - 2 = 5 days of work to 7 - 1 = 6 days of work, and the sheets per day calculation changes from 60 / 5 = 12 to 60 / 6 = 10. The modified steps follow the same logical structure and computation as the original solution and only alter the counting result for the number of workdays.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nPlease provide your response here.\n\nPlease note that the solution is incorrect. The first wrong step is step #3, which is the step where the error occurs. The explanation is as follows:\n\nThe error occurs when dividing 60 by 6, which results in 10. However, this calculation is incorrect because it assumes that Evelyn works 6 days a week, which is not the case. Evelyn takes Monday and Friday off, so she only works 4 days a week. Therefore, the correct calculation is 60 / 4 = 15 sheets of paper per day at work.\n\nThe solution is incorrect, and the first wrong step is step #3."
