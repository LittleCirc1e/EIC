        "question": "It’s exam season and Tristan has several exams to prepare for. On Monday, he studies for 4 hours then studies for twice this long on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday he studies for 3 hours each day. He wants to study for a total of 25 hours over the week and divides the remaining amount of study time evenly between Saturday and Sunday. How many hours does Tristan spend studying on Saturday?",
        "original_solution": "On Tuesday, Tristan studies twice as long as he did on Monday and this amounts to 4 hours * 2 = 8 hours.\nSo in the first 5 days of the week, he studies for a total of 4 hours Monday + 8 hours Tuesday + 3 hours Wednesday + 3 hours Thursday + 3 hours Friday = 21 hours.\nHe therefore has 25 planned hours – 21 used hours = 4 hours left to study.\nAs he splits his time evenly over 2 days, he spends 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours studying on Saturday.\n#### 2",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 4 of the transformed_solution incorrectly assumes that the weekend is 1 day instead of 2, therefore changing 4 hours / 2 to 4 hours / 1. The mistake results in Tristan spending all 4 remaining hours on Saturday as opposed to dividing them evenly between Saturday and Sunday. This counting error affects only the final step related to the allocation of study hours over the weekend and the subsequent calculation of hours studied on Saturday, without affecting previous or unrelated steps.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #4, which must be an integer, and the explanation is #, which is your explanation about why the [Solution] is incorrect.\n\nThe first mistake is in step #4, where Tristan mistakenly counts the weekend as one day instead of two days. This leads to an error in his calculation of the total hours he has available to study over the weekend. As a result, he overestimates the amount of time he has available to study on Saturday.\n\nThe correct calculation is as follows:\n\nMonday: 4 hours\nTuesday: 8 hours\nWednesday: 3 hours\nThursday: 3 hours\nFriday: 3 hours\n\nTotal hours studied so far: 4 + 8 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 21 hours\n\nRemaining hours to study: 25 - 21 = 4 hours\n\nCorrect answer: Tristan spends 4 hours studying on Saturday."
