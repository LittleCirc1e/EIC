        "question": "Angelo and Melanie want to plan how many hours over the next week they should study together for their test next week. They have 2 chapters of their textbook to study and 4 worksheets to memorize. They figure out that they should dedicate 3 hours to each chapter of their textbook and 1.5 hours for each worksheet. If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?",
        "original_solution": "Angelo and Melanie think they should dedicate 3 hours to each of the 2 chapters, 3 hours x 2 chapters = 6 hours total.\nFor the worksheets they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet, 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = 6 hours total.\nAngelo and Melanie need to start with planning 12 hours to study, at 4 hours a day, 12 / 4 = 3 days.\nHowever, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. Every hour they want to include a 10-minute break, so 12 total hours x 10 minutes = 120 extra minutes for breaks.\nThey also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks, 3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes.\nAnd they want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day, so 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = 180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = 3 extra hours.\nSo Angelo and Melanie want to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = 15 hours total.\nThey want to study no more than 4 hours each day, 15 hours / 4 hours each day = 3.75\nThey will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.\n#### 4",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, steps 4 and 5 make multiple incorrect unit conversions, which results in multiple errors in subsequent calculations. The 1-hour break is increased from 10 minutes to 15 minutes, altering the total additional minutes for breaks from 120 minutes to 180 minutes. The snack breaks also change from 10 minutes each to 15 minutes each, altering the total additional minutes for snack breaks from 30 minutes to 45 minutes. Finally, the minute-to-hour conversion rate is also altered incorrectly from 60 minutes per hour to 50 minutes per hour. These changes lead to a modification of the total study and break hours required, changing the end result from the original answer of 4 days to the transformed answer of 5 days. The explanation should pinpoint the incorrect minute-to-hour conversion rate as this is the fundamental error introduced.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #3, which must be an integer, and the explanation is #, which is your explanation about why the [Solution] is incorrect.\n\nThe first mistake is that Angelo and Melanie are dedicating 3 hours to each chapter, which is incorrect because there are 2 chapters, so they should dedicate 3 hours to each chapter, not 6 hours total. The correct calculation for the time spent on chapters is 3 hours x 2 chapters = 6 hours.\n\nThe second mistake is that Angelo and Melanie are dedicating 1.5 hours to each worksheet, which is incorrect because there"
