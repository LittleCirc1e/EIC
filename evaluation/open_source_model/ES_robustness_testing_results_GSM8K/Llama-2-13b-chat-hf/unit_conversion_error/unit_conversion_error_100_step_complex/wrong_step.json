        "question": "It takes 1 hour for refrigerated dough to come to room temperature. It takes 15 minutes to shape the dough and 2 hours to proof. The bread takes 30 minutes to bake and 15 minutes to cool. If the bakery opens at 6:00 am, what is the latest time the head baker can make it to the store to start working?",
        "original_solution": "It takes 1 hour to bring the dough to room temp and 2 hours to proof the dough so that's 1+2 = 3 hours\nIt takes 15 minutes to shape the dough, 30 minutes to bake and another 15 minutes to cool for a total of 15+30+15 = 60 minutes\nThere are 60 minutes in 1 hour so that takes him 60/60 = 1 hour\nIn total it takes 3+1 = 4 hours from start to finish to make the bread\nIf the bakery opens at 6:00 am and it takes 4 hours to prep then the latest the head baker can show up is 6-4 = 2:00 am\n#### 2",
        "original_answer": 2.0,
        "transformed_solution": "It takes 1 hour to bring the dough to room temp and 2 hours to proof the dough so that's 1+2 = 3 hours\nIt takes 15 minutes to shape the dough, 30 minutes to bake and another 15 minutes to cool for a total of 15+30+15 = 60 minutes\nThere are 70 minutes in 1 hour so that takes him 60/70 = 0.857 hours\nIn total it takes 3+0.857 = 3.857 hours from start to finish to make the bread\nIf the bakery opens at 6:00 am and it takes 3.857 hours to prep then the latest the head baker can show up is 6-3.857 = 2:08.6 am (rounding to the nearest minute gives 2:09 am)\n#### 2.15",

        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 3 falsely infers that there are 70 minutes in an hour instead of 60 minutes, thus the intermediate calculation changes from 60/60 = 1 hour in the original_solution to 60/70 = 0.857 hours in the transformed_solution. This error subsequently affects the calculation in step 4, where the total time required from start to finish changes from 3+1 = 4 hours to 3+0.857 = 3.857 hours. Finally, it impacts the result in step 5, calculating the latest time the baker can start working from 6:00 am. Instead of the original 2:00 am, the falsely transformed solution indicates it's 2:08.6 am, which rounds to 2:09 am. Therefore, the transformed answer is 2.15 hours represented in decimal format which corresponds to 2:09 am. Note that the error is only introduced once and the unrelated steps remain unaffected.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nPlease provide your response here.\n\nI have reviewed the provided [Question] and [Solution]. Based on the definition of first wrong step, I have determined that the first wrong step in the provided [Solution] is step 4, where the calculation 30 + 15 + 15 = 60 is incorrect. The correct calculation is 30 + 15 + 15 = 65.\n\nTherefore, the first wrong step is step 4, and the explanation is that step 4 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 60 instead of 65. The subsequent step 5 references the result of step 4, calculating 60/70 = 0.857 instead of 65/70 = 0.933. The subsequent step 6 references the result of step 5, calculating 0.857 hours instead of 0.933 hours.\n\nThe final incorrect answer is 2:09 am, and the correct answer is 2:03 am.\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 4, and the explanation is that step 4 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 60 instead of 65."
