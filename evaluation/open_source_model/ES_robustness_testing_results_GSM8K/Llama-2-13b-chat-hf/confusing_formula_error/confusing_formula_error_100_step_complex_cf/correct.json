        "question": "Mark made a chalkboard that is 3 feet wide. It is 2 times as long as it is wide. What is the area of the chalkboard?",
        "original_solution": "The length of the chalkboard is 2 x the width of 3 feet = 6 feet.\nWe can calculate area by multiplying the width and the length, so 3 feet x 6 feet = 18 feet.\n#### 18",
        "original_answer": 18.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The length of the chalkboard is 2 x the width of 3 feet = 6 feet.\nWe can calculate area by adding the width and the length, so 3 feet + 6 feet = 9 feet.\n#### 9",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the area calculation of the rectangle with adding the length and the width. The question requires the area to be solved by multiplying the length by the width, resulting in 3 feet x 6 feet = 18 square feet in the original_solution being mistakenly changed to 3 feet + 6 feet = 9 square feet in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent result which is supposed to be the area but is calculated incorrectly. Note that the language description of step 2 < We can calculate area by multiplying the width and the length > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. In this example, only step 2 mistakenly applies the formula for calculating perimeter instead of area. The other steps remain correct.",

        "question": "Wendi lives on a plot of land that is 200 feet by 900 feet of grassland. She raises rabbits on her property by allowing the rabbits to graze on the grass that grows on her land. If one rabbit can eat enough grass to clear ten square yards of lawn area per day, and Wendi owns 100 rabbits, how many days would it take for Wendi's rabbits to clear all the grass off of her grassland property?",

        "explanation": "In step 2, the formula to calculate the square footage corresponding to ten square yards is confused with summing the sides of a square yard (perimeter), leading to an incorrect calculation of area. The correct approach is to multiply 9 square feet by 10 to find the area that one rabbit can clear, whereas the transformed solution incorrectly adds the lengths of the sides of a square yard (3 feet per side). Consequently, this affects the calculation of how much area 100 rabbits can clear per day in step 3, thus leading to a different and incorrect total number of days calculated in step 5.",
