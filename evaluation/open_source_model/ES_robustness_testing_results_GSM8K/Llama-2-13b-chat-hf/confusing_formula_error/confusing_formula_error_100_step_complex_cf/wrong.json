Since each level has one more case per side than the level above it, the second level has sides that are 2 cases long.\nWe can figure out how many cases we need for the second level by finding the area of a square with a side length of 2: 2 cases * 2 cases = 4 cases\nThe third level has three cases per side, so we need to find the area of a square with side length 3: 3 cases * 3 cases = 9 cases\nThe fourth level has a side length of 4, so we find its area with 4 cases * 4 cases = 16 cases\nFinally, we add up the number of cases we need on each level: 1 cases + 4 cases + 9 cases + 16 cases = 30 cases\n#### 30",

The original solution correctly uses the formula for area by multiplying the length by the width. In the transformed solution, the formula is mistakenly changed to a perimeter calculation by adding the length and width, resulting in 120 * 120 = 14400 square inches in the original_solution becoming 120 + 120 = 240 square inches in the transformed_solution. This affects the transformed_answer while other steps remain correct and unaltered, maintaining the description language of step 2 without changing any words, consistent with the given directive that language descriptions should not be altered.
