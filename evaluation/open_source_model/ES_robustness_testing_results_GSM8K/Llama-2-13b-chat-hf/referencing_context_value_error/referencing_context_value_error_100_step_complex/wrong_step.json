        "question": "There is a road stretching 3 miles from the base camp to the chain challenge. Every 20 minutes, a car comes down the road from the base camp towards the chain challenge. How many hours have passed once 30 cars have come down the road?",

        "original_answer": 10.0,
        "transformed_solution": "25*30 = 750 minutes have passed.\n750/60 = 12.5 hours have passed.\n#### 12.5",

        "explanation": "Step 1 references 20 in the question as 25 wrongly, and calculates 25*30=750 instead of 20*30=600. Its subsequent related step will be affected, calculating 750/60=12.5 instead of 600/60=10 in step 2. Please note that you should only consider one error, so step 2 still references 60 in the question correctly.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nPlease provide your response here.\n\nI'm happy to help! Based on the information provided, I can determine whether the solution is correct or not.\n\nThe solution provided is:\n\n25*30 = 750 minutes have passed.\n750/60 = 12.5 hours have passed.\n#### 12.5.\n\nTo determine if the solution is correct, I will follow the instructions provided.\n\nFirst, I will consider that a single type of error occurs in one step, and that is, there is only a certain type of error occurring in a certain step, and it will affect the subsequent steps that reference its results and lead to the final wrong answer. In other words, this certain step is the first step to make a mistake and also the root cause of the mistake.\n\nAfter carefully reviewing the solution, I noticed that the first wrong step is step 2, where the mistake occurs in unit conversion. The solution mistakenly believes that one hour has 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes, calculating 25 x 30 = 750 instead of 25 x 60 = 1500.\n\nTherefore, the first wrong step is step 2, and the explanation is that step 2 first makes a mistake in unit conversion and mistakenly believes that one hour has 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes, calculating 750 instead of 1500. The subsequent steps reference the result of step 2, calculating 750/60 = 12.5 instead of 1500/60 = 25, resulting in the final incorrect answer.\n\nThe solution is incorrect, and the first wrong step is step 2. The correct answer is 25 x 60 = 1500 minutes have passed, and 1500/60 = 25 hours have passed.\n\nTherefore, the correct solution is:\n\n25 x 60 = 1500 minutes have passed.\n1500/60 = 25 hours have passed.\n#### 25.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
