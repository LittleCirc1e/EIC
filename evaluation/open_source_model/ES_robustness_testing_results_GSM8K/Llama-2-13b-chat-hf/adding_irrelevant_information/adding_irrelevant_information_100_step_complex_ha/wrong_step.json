        "original_solution": "Grace sold and gave a total of 1 + 1 = 2 whole pumpkin pie.\nHer family was left with 4 - 2 = 2 whole pumpkin pie.\nThere were a total of 2 x 6 = 12 pieces made from the 2 whole pumpkin pie.\nHer family ate 12 x 2/3 = 8 pieces.\nTherefore, 12 - 8 = 4 pieces of pumpkin pie were left.\n#### 4",
