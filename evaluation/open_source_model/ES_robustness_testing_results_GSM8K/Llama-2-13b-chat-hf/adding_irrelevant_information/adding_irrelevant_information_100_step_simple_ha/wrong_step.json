        "original_solution": "2 weeks have 2 weeks* 7 days per week = 14 days\nCounting the days until the first and second vaccine, and the days to the vaccine to be fully effective, Mark has to wait 4 days + 20 days + 14 days = 38 days\n#### 38",

Counting the days until the first and second vaccine, and the days to the vaccine to be fully effective, Mark has to wait 4 days + 3 days + 20 days + 14 days = 41 days\n#### 41",
