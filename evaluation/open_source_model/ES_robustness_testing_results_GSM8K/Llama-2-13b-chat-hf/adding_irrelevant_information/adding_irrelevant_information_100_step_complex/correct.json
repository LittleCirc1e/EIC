        "question": "Quinton brought 40 cupcakes to school on his birthday. He gave a cupcake to each of the 18 students in Ms. Delmont's class. He also gave a cupcake to each of the 16 students in Mrs. Donnelly's class. He also gave a cupcake to Ms. Delmont, Mrs. Donnelly, the school nurse, and the school principal. How many cupcakes did he have left over?",
        "original_solution": "Quinton had 40 cupcakes - 18 = 22 cupcakes.\nHe then had 22 cupcakes - 16 students = 6 cupcakes.\nQuinton then gave away 6 - 1 -1 -1 -1 = 2 cupcakes left.\n#### 2",
        "original_answer": 2.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Quinton had 40 cupcakes - 18 students = 22 cupcakes.\nHe then had 22 cupcakes - 16 students = 6 cupcakes left.\nBecause he gave an additional cupcake to the librarian, Quinton then gave away 6 - 1 -1 -1 -1 -1 = 1 cupcake left.\n#### 1",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 3 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <Because he gave an additional cupcake to the librarian>, resulting in step 3 changing from 6 - 1 -1 -1 -1 = 2 cupcakes left in the original_solution to 6 - 1 -1 -1 -1 -1 = 1 cupcake left in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nPlease provide your response here.\n\nI have reviewed the provided [Question], [Solution], and the two incorrect [Solution]s and their corresponding [Output]s. Based on the definition of first wrong step, I have determined that the first wrong step in the provided [Solution] is step 3, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nIn step 3, the calculation 22 cupcakes - 16 students = 6 cupcakes is correct. However, the subsequent step 4 references the result of step 3, which is incorrect. Specifically, the calculation 6 cupcakes - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 = 1 cupcake left is incorrect, as it should be 6 - 1 = 5 cupcakes left.\n\nTherefore, the first wrong step is step 3, and the explanation is that step 3 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 6 cupcakes - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 = 1 cupcake left instead of 6 - 1 = 5 cupcakes left. The subsequent step 4 references the result of step 3, calculating 1 cupcake left instead of 5 cupcakes left, resulting in the final incorrect answer.\n\nThe correct answer is 5 cupcakes left.\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 3, and the explanation is that step 3 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 6 cupcakes - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 = 1 cupcake left instead of 6 - 1 = 5 cupcakes left. The subsequent step 4 references the result of step 3, calculating 1 cupcake left instead of 5 cupcakes left, resulting in the final incorrect answer. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 3."
