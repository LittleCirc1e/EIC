        "question": "In a set of magicians cards, there are 15 red cards, and 60% more green cards. Yellow cards are as many, as the sum of red and green cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?",
        "original_solution": "There are 60/100 * 15 = 9 more green cards than red cards.\nWhich means there are 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.\nYellow cards make up to 15 + 24 = 39 cards.\nSo in total, there are 39 + 39 = 78 cards of different colors.\n#### 78",
        "original_answer": 78.0,
        "transformed_solution": "There are 60/100 * 15 = 9 more green cards than red cards.\nWhich means there are 15 - 9 = 6 green cards.\nYellow cards make up to 15 + 6 = 21 cards.\nSo in total, there are 21 + 21 = 42 cards of different colors.\n#### 42",

        "explanation": "The example changes the addition in the second step of the calculation to subtraction by turning the correct form '15 + 9 = 24' into '15 - 9 = 6', thus showing an incorrect number of green cards. This logically affects the related subsequent steps. The next step incorrectly calculates the number of yellow cards (now the sum is 15 + 6 = 21), and the final total is incorrectly calculated as 21 + 21 = 42 cards. It should be noted that the operator is only incorrect in the second step with the calculation correctly made based on the incorrect operator, leading to incorrect results for the subsequent figures that rely on it.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #3, which must be an integer, and the explanation is #, which is your explanation about why the [Solution] is incorrect.\n\nThe mistake in the solution is that the number of yellow cards is calculated incorrectly. The correct calculation is 15 + 6 = 21, not 21 + 21 = 42. Therefore, the final answer is 21, not 42."
