Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nin 1998 the profits of company n were 10 percent of revenues. in 1999, the revenues of company n fell by 30 percent, but profits were 10 percent of revenues. the profits in 1999 were what percent of the profits in 1998?\n\n### Response:",
        "output_str": "Let $x$ be the profits in 1998 and $y$ be the revenues in 1998.\nWe are given that $x = 0.1y$.\nIn 1999, the revenues fell by 30 percent, so the new revenues are $0.7y$.\nThe profits in 1999 are still 10 percent of the new revenues, so the new profits are $0.1(0.7y) = 0.07y$.\nWe want to find the ratio of the profits in 1999 to the profits in 1998, which is $\\frac{0.07y}{x}$.\nSubstituting $x = 0.1y$, we have $\\frac{0.07y}{0.1y} = \\frac{0.07}{0.1} = \\boxed{70\\%}$.\nThe answer is: 70",
