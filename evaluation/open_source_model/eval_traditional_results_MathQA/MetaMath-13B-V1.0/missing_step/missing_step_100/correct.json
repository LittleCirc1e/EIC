Consequently, step 2 should reference the result from the question, which is 50 doughnuts equivalent to 5 parts. The reference to each part being equivalent to 10 still holds as the calculation method is correct, but since we consider there to be 10 parts of muffins instead of 1, step 2 should be modified to reflect a 1:1 part ratio between doughnuts and muffins. Given there are 50 doughnuts, the calculation changes to 50 x 1 = 50 for the number of muffins, which should ultimately modify the formula to 50 x 1 = 50. It should be noted that the calculation in step 3 maintains the error and refers incorrectly to '10 parts of muffins', as the initial step that created the incorrect carryover effect from the deletion is step 1, thus it is marked as the wrong_step. The transformed_solution erroneously states that there are 100 muffins due to incorrectly maintaining the original step 4 calculation without adjusting for the altered quantity suggested by the deleted step 1 (10 parts was used instead of the correct 1 part, leading to multiplying by 10 instead of 1)."

In the original_solution, step 4 references the total number of legs and heads, and the relationship between them stated in the question, setting up the equation 4d + 2p = 28 + 2(d + p). Step 5 references the result of step 4 and simplifies the equation. Therefore, after deleting step 4, step 5 directly attempts to use the elimination method incorrectly without establishing the proper equation from the relationship of legs and heads; it incorrectly concludes that 2p can be canceled out from both sides without considering the dogs' count, leading us to a nonsensical simplification 0 = 28, which implies that the system of equations has no solution. This step also incorrectly references numbers from the question itself. Since this is nonsense and does not provide a solution, the transformed_answer is set to -1 to indicate an error in the process. It is step 3 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 4 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step removed in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 3."

The modified solution skips the calculation of Shekhar's current age and refers directly to his age after 6 years, which is 26. Since step 1 references a number from the question (Shekhar's age after 6 years), the subsequent step that references the result of step 1 now refers back to the age of Shekhar after 6 years instead. As the next step originally multiplied Shekhar's current age by (3/4) to get Shobha's current age, the transformation led to 26 * (3/4), the largest number provided by the context of the original step 1. This is an error because the age after 6 years was used instead of the current age, giving an inflated number for Shobha's age.
