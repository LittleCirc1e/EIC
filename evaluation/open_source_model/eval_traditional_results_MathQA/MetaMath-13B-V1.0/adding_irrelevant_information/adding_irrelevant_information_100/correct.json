        "output_str": "If 15 percent of the drink is orange juice, then the amount of orange juice in the drink is 15/100 * total drink = 0.15 * total drink.\nIf 60 percent of the drink is watermelon juice, then the amount of watermelon juice in the drink is 60/100 * total drink = 0.6 * total drink.\nWe know that the drink is made with 35 ounces of grape juice, so the total drink is 35 + 0.15 * total drink + 0.6 * total drink.\nCombining like terms, we have 35 + 0.75 * total drink.\nSince we want to find the total drink, we can set up the equation 35 + 0.75 * total drink = total drink.\nSimplifying the equation, we have 0.75 * total drink = total drink - 35.\nSubtracting total drink from both sides, we have 0.75 * total drink - total drink = -35.\nSimplifying further, we have -0.25 * total drink = -35.\nDividing both sides by -0.25, we have total drink = -35 / -0.25 = 140.\nTherefore, the drink is a total of 140 ounces.\n#### 140\nThe answer is: 140",
