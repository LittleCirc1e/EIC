        "output_str": "Let $x$ be the amount of milk in the first glass and $y$ be the amount of milk in the second glass.\nWe are given that $x = \\frac{1}{4}$ and $y = \\frac{1}{5}$.\nAfter filling the glasses with water, the total amount of milk in the tumbler is $x + y$.\nThe total amount of water in the tumbler is the sum of the water in the glasses, which is $4x + 5y$.\nThe ratio of milk to water in the tumbler is $\\frac{x + y}{4x + 5y}$.\nSubstituting the given values, we have $\\frac{\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5}}{4\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) + 5\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)}$.\nSimplifying, we get $\\frac{\\frac{9}{20} + \\frac{12}{20}}{4\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) + 5\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)}$.\nFurther simplifying, we have $\\frac{\\frac{21}{20}}{4\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) + 5\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)}$.\nContinuing to simplify, we get $\\frac{\\frac{21}{20}}{\\frac{4}{20} + \\frac{5}{20}}$.\nCombining the fractions, we have $\\frac{\\frac{21}{20}}{\\frac{9}{20}}$.\nDividing, we get $\\frac{21}{9}$.\nTherefore, the ratio of milk to water in the tumbler is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{3}}$.The answer is: \\frac{7}{3}",
