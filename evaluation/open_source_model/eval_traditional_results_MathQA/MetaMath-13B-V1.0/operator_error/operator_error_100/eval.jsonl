What is the distance traveled by Maxwell when they meet in the middle?\n\n### Response:", "output_str": "The total distance between their homes is 36 kilometers.\nMaxwell's walking speed is 3 km/h, so he walks at a rate of 3 km/h * 2 = 6 km/h when walking toward Brad's house.\nBrad's running speed is 6 km/h, so he runs at a rate of 6 km/h * 2 = 12 km/h when running toward Maxwell's house.\nWhen they meet in the middle, Maxwell has traveled a distance of 6 km/h * 2 = 12 kilometers.\n#### 12\nThe answer is: 12"}
