However, the transformed solution incorrectly replaces the multiplication with division in step 2, which fundamentally changes the nature of the problem to an impossible division scenario that doesn’t produce a meaningful result (dividing zero or attempting to plot an impossible function). This cascades through to step 3, resulting in a division equation that incorrectly suggests n divided by a cubic function equals zero. As a consequence, the final solution is nonsensical, yielding zero for the sum of the numbers. The only operator change—the division instead of multiplication—causes a fundamental error so early in the solution process that no meaningful problem exists."
