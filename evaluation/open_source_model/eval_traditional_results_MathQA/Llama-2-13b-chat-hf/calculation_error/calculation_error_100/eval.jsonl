Since the diagonals are 14 cm and 20 cm, we can let the length of one side be x cm.\n\nUsing the fact that the sum of the lengths of the diagonals is equal to the perimeter of the rhombus, we can set up the equation:\n\n14 + 20 = 4x + 4\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n34 = 4x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 8\n\nSo, the length of one side of the rhombus is 8 cm.\n\nNow, we can find the area of the rhombus by multiplying the length of one side by itself:\n\nArea = x \\* x\n= 8 \\* 8\n= 64 cm^2\n\nTherefore, the area of the rhombus is 64 cm^2."}

Since two-thirds of the roads from A to B are at least 5 miles long, the probability of picking a road that is at least 5 miles long is 2/3.\n\nNext, let's calculate the probability that a randomly picked road from B to C is at least 5 miles long. Since half of the roads from B to C are at least 5 miles long, the probability of picking a road that is at least 5 miles long is 1/2.\n\nNow, we need to multiply these two probabilities together to find the overall probability that at least one of the roads you pick is at least 5 miles long. So, we multiply 2/3 by 1/2 to get:\n\n2/3 x 1/2 = 1/3\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one of the roads you pick is at least 5 miles long is 1/3."}

Based on the information provided, we can let George's age be G and Christopher's age be C. Since Ford is 2 years younger than Christopher, Ford's age is C - 2.\n\nWe know that the sum of their ages is 60, so we can set up the equation:\n\nG + (C - 2) + Ford = 60\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nG + C - 2 + Ford = 60\n\nSince George is 8 years more than Christopher, we can write:\n\nG = C + 8\n\nSubstituting this into the previous equation, we get:\n\nC + (C + 8) - 2 + Ford = 60\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2C + 8 + Ford = 60\n\nNow we can solve for Ford's age:\n\nFord = 60 - 2C - 8\n\nSince the sum of their ages is 60, we know that C + 2 = 60. Solving for C, we get:\n\nC = 58\n\nNow we can find Ford's age:\n\nFord = 60 - 2(58) - 8\n\nFord = 60 - 116 - 8\n\nFord = 42\n\nTherefore, Ford's age is 42 years old."}
