Consequently, step 2 should reference the result from the question, which is 50 doughnuts equivalent to 5 parts. The reference to each part being equivalent to 10 still holds as the calculation method is correct, but since we consider there to be 10 parts of muffins instead of 1, step 2 should be modified to reflect a 1:1 part ratio between doughnuts and muffins. Given there are 50 doughnuts, the calculation changes to 50 x 1 = 50 for the number of muffins, which should ultimately modify the formula to 50 x 1 = 50. It should be noted that the calculation in step 3 maintains the error and refers incorrectly to '10 parts of muffins', as the initial step that created the incorrect carryover effect from the deletion is step 1, thus it is marked as the wrong_step. The transformed_solution erroneously states that there are 100 muffins due to incorrectly maintaining the original step 4 calculation without adjusting for the altered quantity suggested by the deleted step 1 (10 parts was used instead of the correct 1 part, leading to multiplying by 10 instead of 1)."

The original step involves multiplying 15 small boxes by 25 chocolate bars per box, which is correct and gives 375 chocolate bars. However, in the transformed solution, we retain the multiplication of the numbers but mistakenly keep only one factor of 25, instead of multiplying it by 15 to get the total. This results in an incorrect number of chocolate bars (25 instead of 375). The erroneous result is carried on from the first step, making it the wrong_step. Since the error is due to an incorrect calculation rather than the omission of a step or concept, we categorize it as a calculation error."

            "explanation": "Here, the original step 1 has been removed. The original step 1 calculates the amount of decrease by subtracting the sale price from the original price. Since step 1 has been removed, step 2 in the transformed_solution is now step 1 and incorrectly references 60 from the question as the amount of decrease instead of using the correct decrease value which should be 40, the calculation now incorrectly becomes (60/100) x 100 resulting in an incorrect transformed_answer of 60%. It should note that the correct value for the amount of decrease is the difference between the original price and the sale price (100 - 60 = 40). The transformed_solution should then use this correct decrease amount to calculate the percent decrease. Hence, step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also the first step referring to the incorrect number, is the wrong_step."
