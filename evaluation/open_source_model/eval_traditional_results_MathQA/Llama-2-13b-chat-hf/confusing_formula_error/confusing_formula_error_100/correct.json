The question requires that the perimeter of the triangle to be solved be equal to 3 times the length of one side, rather than 2 times the length of one side which would imply the semi-perimeter.

The other steps in the solution are the calculations based on the confused formula, hence the transformation only impacts the formula used in the first step while subsequent steps follow through with the incorrect factor. The language description < The perimeter of an equilateral triangle is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution.
