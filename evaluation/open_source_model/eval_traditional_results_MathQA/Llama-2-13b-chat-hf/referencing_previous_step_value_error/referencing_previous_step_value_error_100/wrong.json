        "output_str": "\n\nTo find out how many coins of each type are there in the bag, we need to use the concept of \"equivalent ratios.\" Let's assume that the number of one rupee coins, 50 paise coins, and 25 paise coins are x, y, and z respectively.\n\nWe know that the total value of the coins is 210, so we can set up the following equation:\n\nx + y + z = 210\n\nWe also know that the number of one rupee coins is equal to the number of 50 paise coins plus the number of 25 paise coins, so we can write:\n\nx + y = 250\n\nNow we have two equations and three unknowns. Can you solve for x, y, and z?\n\nOnce you have solved for x, y, and z, you can find out how many coins of each type are in the bag by multiplying the number of coins by the value of each coin.

In this case, the relative speed is the difference between the speed of the train and the speed of the jogger.\n\nLet's first find the relative speed:\n\nRelative speed = 27 km/hr - 9 km/hr = 18 km/hr\n\nNow, we need to find the time it will take for the train to pass the jogger. We can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Relative speed\n\nIn this case, the distance between the train and the jogger is 240 m. So, we can plug in the values as follows:\n\nTime = 240 m / 18 km/hr = 13.33 seconds\n\nTherefore, it will take the train approximately 13.33 seconds to pass the jogger.",
