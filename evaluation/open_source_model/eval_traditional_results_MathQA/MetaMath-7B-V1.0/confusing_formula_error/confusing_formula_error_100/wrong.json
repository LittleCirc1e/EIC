This affects the subsequent step of calculating the percentage change, changing the area reduction from 19% to a circumference reduction of 18%. Note that the language description of step 3 < The new area of the circle is > in the original_solution is incorrectly maintained as < The new circumference is > in the transformed_solution. The relevant language description should reflect the property being calculated (i.e., area or circumference), but here it is kept unchanged to follow the case generation process instructions.
