We are given that $x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{39}$.\nThis means that $x$ can be written as $x = 39k + 16$ for some integer $k$.\nWe want to find the remainder when $x$ is divided by 13.\nSubstituting $x = 39k + 16$ into the equation, we have $39k + 16 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{13}$.\nSimplifying, we get $39k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}$.\nSince 39 is divisible by 13, we can divide both sides of the congruence by 13 to get $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}$.\nTherefore, $k$ can be written as $k = 13m$ for some integer $m$.\nSubstituting $k = 13m$ back into the equation for $x$, we have $x = 39(13m) + 16 = 467m + 16$.\nSo, $x$ can be written as $x = 467m + 16$.\nThe remainder when $x$ is divided by 13 is the same as the remainder when $16$ is divided by 13.\nSince $16 = 13(1) + 3$, the remainder is $\\boxed{3}$.The answer is: 3",

This incorrect total distance affects the subsequent calculation of average speed, where 60 km is divided by the total time (which remains 2 hours correctly) to produce an average speed of 30 km/h. All other calculations are correct, but the wrongful change of the operator in step 1 leads to a transformed answer that is different from the original."

This results in an impossible count of boys, calculated in step 2 as 160 - 320 = -160, which is not a feasible number of students. The original count was 80 boys, so the transformation caused by the operator error in step 1 led to a nonsensical answer.
