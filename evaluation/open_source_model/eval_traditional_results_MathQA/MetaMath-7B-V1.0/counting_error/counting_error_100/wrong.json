            "explanation": "Here, step 3 erroneously counts the number of hours the station is open from Monday to Friday as 15 hours per day instead of the correct 16 hours. This changes the calculation from (16 * 5) = 80 hours to (15 * 5) = 75 hours, and subsequently, the total number of cars served from Monday to Friday changes from 80 * 9 = 720 cars to 75 * 9 = 675 cars. The final step summing up the total number of cars served during the week is then affected, with the original 256 + 160 + 720 changing to 256 + 160 + 675, resulting in a different total of 1091 cars. The previous and unrelated steps remain unaffected and correct."
