        "output_str": "Let $d$ be the number of dogs and $p$ be the number of people.\nThe number of legs is $d+2p$ and the number of heads is $d+p$.\nWe are given that the number of legs is 28 more than twice the number of heads, so we have the equation $d+2p = 2(d+p)+28$.\nSimplifying, we get $d+2p = 2d+2p+28$.\nSubtracting $2d$ and $2p$ from both sides, we get $d+2p-2d-2p = 28$.\nSimplifying further, we get $-d = 28$.\nDividing both sides by $-1$, we get $d = -28$.\nSince the number of dogs cannot be negative, we discard this solution.\nTherefore, there were $\\boxed{0}$ dogs in the group.The answer is: 0",
