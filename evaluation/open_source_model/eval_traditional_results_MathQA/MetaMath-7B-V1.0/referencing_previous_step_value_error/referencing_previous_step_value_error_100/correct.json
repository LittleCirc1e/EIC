For this particular shoe, each unit increase in size corresponds to a 1/5-inch increase in the length of the shoe. If the largest size of this shoe is 20% longer than the smallest size, how long, in inches, is the shoe in size 15?\n\n### Response:",
        "output_str": "Let $x$ be the length of the shoe in size 8.\nSince each unit increase in size corresponds to a 1/5-inch increase in the length of the shoe,\nthe length of the shoe in size 15 is $x + 12 \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} = x + 2.4$.\nWe are given that the largest size of the shoe is 20% longer than the smallest size,\nso the length of the shoe in size 15 is 120% of the length in size 8.\nTherefore, we have the equation $x + 2.4 = 1.2x$.\nSolving for $x$, we find $x = 8$.\nSubstituting this value back into the expression for the length of the shoe in size 15,\nwe find that the length is $8 + 2.4 = \\boxed{10.4}$ inches.\nThe answer is: 10.4",
