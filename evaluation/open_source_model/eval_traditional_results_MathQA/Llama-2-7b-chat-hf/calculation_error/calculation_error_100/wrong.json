Since the spheres are made from a solid cylinder, the radius of each sphere is half the diameter of the cylinder. Therefore, the radius of each sphere is 8 cm.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere to find the diameter of each sphere:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n= (4/3)π(8)³\n= 128π\n\nSo, the diameter of each sphere is 128π cm.",
