            "explanation": "Step 1 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <and there is a penalty of 2 units for drawing numbers on the board>, resulting in step 1 changing from x = 6a + 3 in the original_solution to x = 6a + 3 - 2 in the transformed_solution. This change affects the calculation of the square of the number and thus the wrong remainder is obtained when divided by 6. It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct."

        "output_str": "\nWhen the square of the number (x^2) is divided by 6, the remainder is also 3.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen a number is divided by 6, the remainder is 3. In the case of the square of the number (x^2), when divided by 6, the remainder is also 3. This is because the square of the number (x^2) can be written as 6x^2 + 3x, and when divided by 6, the remainder is 3.",
