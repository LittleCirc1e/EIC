Find the length of the faster train?\n\n### Response:", "output_str": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the concept of relative speed, which is the speed at which the faster train is moving relative to the slower train. The relative speed between the two trains is the difference between their speeds.\n\nSo, the relative speed between the two trains is:\n\nRelative speed = Faster train speed - Slower train speed\n= 162 kmph - 18 kmph\n= 144 kmph\n\nNow, we need to find the length of the faster train. We can use the formula:\n\nLength = Speed x Time\n\nIn this case, the time taken by the faster train to cross the man in the slower train is 33 seconds. So, we can plug in the values and solve for the length of the faster train:\n\nLength = 144 kmph x 33 seconds\n= 47,920 meters\n\nTherefore, the length of the faster train is 47,920 meters."}
