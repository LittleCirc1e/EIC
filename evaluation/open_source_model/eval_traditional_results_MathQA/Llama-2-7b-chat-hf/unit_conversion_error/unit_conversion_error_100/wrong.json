What is the minimum constant speed in miles per hour that Alice must exceed in order to arrive in city B before Bob?\n\n### Response:",
        "output_str": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the concept of relative speed, which is the speed at which Alice is relative to Bob. Since Bob is driving at a constant speed of 40 miles per hour, we can assume that he is moving at a constant velocity of 40 miles per hour. Therefore, Alice's speed relative to Bob is the difference between her actual speed and Bob's constant speed.\n\nLet's assume that Alice's actual speed is x miles per hour. Since Alice leaves city A 30 minutes after Bob, we can use the formula:\n\nTime taken by Alice = Distance / Speed\n\nAlice's time taken = 30 miles / x miles/hour\n\nSince Bob is moving at a constant speed of 40 miles per hour, Alice must exceed his speed by at least x miles per hour to arrive in city B before him. Therefore, we can set up the following inequality:\n\nx > 40\n\nTo find the minimum value of x, we need to solve for x in the above inequality. When x = 45, Alice's speed must be greater than or equal to 45 miles per hour to arrive in city B before Bob.

        "output_str": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the concept of relative motion. Let's assume that the two projectiles are initially at rest relative to each other. Since they are launched at the same moment, they will have the same initial velocity relative to each other.\n\nThe distance between the two projectiles is given as 1455 km. Let's call the distance between them at the moment of launch as x. Since they are traveling directly towards each other, the distance between them will decrease as they approach each other.\n\nWe can use the formula for relative motion to find the time it will take for the projectiles to meet:\n\ntime = distance / relative velocity\n\nIn this case, the relative velocity is the sum of the velocities of the two projectiles: 470 km/h + 500 km/h = 970 km/h.\n\nNow, we need to find the distance between the two projectiles at the moment they meet. Let's call this distance x. We can use the formula:\n\nx = distance - relative velocity * time\n\nSubstituting the values given in the problem, we get:\n\nx = 1455 km - (970 km/h * time)\n\nNow, we need to solve for time. We can do this by rearranging the equation:\n\ntime = x / (970 km/h)\n\nSubstituting the value of x, we get:\n\ntime = 1455 km / (970 km/h) = 1.5 minutes\n\nTherefore, it will take the two projectiles 1.5 minutes to meet each other.",
