Since step 1 has been removed, step 2 in the transformed_solution is now step 1 and incorrectly references 60 from the question as the amount of decrease instead of using the correct decrease value which should be 40, the calculation now incorrectly becomes (60/100) x 100 resulting in an incorrect transformed_answer of 60%. It should note that the correct value for the amount of decrease is the difference between the original price and the sale price (100 - 60 = 40). The transformed_solution should then use this correct decrease amount to calculate the percent decrease. Hence, step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also the first step referring to the incorrect number, is the wrong_step."
