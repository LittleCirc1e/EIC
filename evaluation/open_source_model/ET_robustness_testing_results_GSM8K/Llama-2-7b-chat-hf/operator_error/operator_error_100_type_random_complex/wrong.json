        "explanation": "This example turns the addition in step 1 into subtraction, and by changing + to -, $100+$25 = $125 becomes $100-$25 = $75. This affects the subsequent related step 2 and 3. Step 2 changes from $125+$50 = $175 to $75+$50 = $125, step 3 changes from $175+$125+$100 = $400 to $125+$75+$100 = $300. It should be noted that only the operator in step 1 is incorrect, but its calculation is correct, which leads to its result being incorrect. This affects the subsequent steps of using its results, but all the calculation of the steps affected by step 1 is correct.",
