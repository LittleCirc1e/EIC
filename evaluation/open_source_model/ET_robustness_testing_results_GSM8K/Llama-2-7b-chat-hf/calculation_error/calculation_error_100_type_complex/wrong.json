The original correct calculation of $130 - $13 = $117 is improperly calculated as $130 - $13 = $120. This results in an incorrect final answer. The subsequent step 5 uses this incorrect price from store B ($120 instead of $117) to compute the difference, $120 - $115 = $5, leading to an incorrect transformed answer of $5 instead of the original answer of $2.
