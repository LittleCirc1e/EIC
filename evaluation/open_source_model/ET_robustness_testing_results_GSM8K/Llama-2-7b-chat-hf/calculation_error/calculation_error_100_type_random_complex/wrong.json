How many weeks will it take him to get to floor push-ups?",

        "explanation": "This transformed solution has a calculation error in step 2 where 45/5 is incorrectly calculated as 7 instead of 9. This is the only calculation error present, and hence there is a single error. The correct calculation should have yielded that it will take 9 weeks, not 7 weeks. The original equation of 45/5 remains unaltered, but the arithmetic calculation provided is incorrect.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution provided is incorrect, and the wrong type is 'missing_step'. The first wrong step is step 4, where the calculation of the number of weeks takes place without any explanation or justification. Therefore, the answer '7 weeks' is incorrect, and the correct answer is 'On Monday he takes 1 week to get to wall push-ups. On Tuesday he takes 1 week to get to high elevation push-ups. On Wednesday he takes 1 week to get to low elevation push-ups. And on Thursday he takes 1 week to get to floor push-ups. In total, it takes him 4 weeks to get to floor push-ups. Therefore, the answer is 4 weeks.'"
