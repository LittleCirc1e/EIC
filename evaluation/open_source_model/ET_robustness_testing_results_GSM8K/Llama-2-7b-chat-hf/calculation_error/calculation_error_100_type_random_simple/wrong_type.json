This affects the subsequent calculation in step 2, where the length of curtains is calculated as 5+76=81 instead of 5+96=101. Changing the result of the first step to an incorrect value and leaving the rest of the solution unchanged results in an incorrect transformed solution. No other steps are affected since no other calculations precede or are independent of the first erroneous step.",

The reasoning is as follows:\n\nThe solution assumes that the curtains will pool at the bottom without considering the height of the ceiling. In reality, the curtains will need to be long enough to reach the ceiling, which is not taken into account in the solution. Therefore, the solution is missing a necessary step to calculate the correct length of the curtains."
