This directly affects the outcome in step 3, where the incorrect total of 20 candles is divided between the two people instead of the correct total of 28 candles. The result of this miscalculation is that each person is incorrectly calculated to get \"20/2 = 10 birthday candles\" instead of the correct answer of \"14 birthday candles\".
