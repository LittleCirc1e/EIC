        "question": "Brian can only hold his breath underwater for 10 seconds. He wants to get better, so he starts practicing. After a week, he's doubled the amount of time he can do it. After another week, he's doubled it again from the previous week. The final week, he's increased it by 50% from the previous week. How long can Brian hold his breath for now?",
        "original_solution": "At the end of his first week, Brian now has doubled his initial time of 10 seconds to 10*2=20 seconds\nAt the end of his second week, Brian doubled the previous week's time of 20 seconds to 20*2=40 seconds\nAt the end of his third week of practice, Brian adds another 50% of 40 seconds to his time so 40*.5= 20 seconds added\nHaving added 20 seconds to his time from his second week, Brian can now hold his breath for 40+20= 60 seconds\n#### 60",

        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references the added time of 20 seconds as 25 from step 3. Despite this inconsistency, step 3 in the transformed_solution <At the end of his third week of practice, Brian adds another 50% of 40 seconds to his time so 40*.5= 20 seconds added> remains exactly the same as step 3 in the original_solution, which correctly calculates the result as 20 seconds. The incorrect reference changes the calculation in step 4 from 40+20= 60 seconds to 40+25= 65 seconds. We only consider this single error, and all calculations are properly carried out based on the error made in that particular step.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. Brian's improvement in holding his breath underwater is a result of consistent and dedicated practice over a period of three weeks. At the end of the first week, he doubled his initial time of 10 seconds to 20 seconds. In the second week, he doubled his time again to 40 seconds. Finally, in the third week, he added an additional 5"
