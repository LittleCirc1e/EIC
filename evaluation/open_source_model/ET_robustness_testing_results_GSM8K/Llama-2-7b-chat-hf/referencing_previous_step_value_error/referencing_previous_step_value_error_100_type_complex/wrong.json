It should be noted that step 1 in the transformed_solution <Total distance travelled is 220km + 110km = 330 km.> should be the same as the step 1 in the original_solution <Total distance travelled is 220km + 110km = 330 km.> and calculates its result 330 km correctly. The change in speed from 110 km/hour to 100 km/hour in step 2 leads to an erroneous calculation of time as 3.3 hours instead of 3 hours. The subsequent step showing the calculated time will reflect this incorrect speed, showing 3.3 hours instead of the correct 3 hours. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the initial distance calculation step is still correct.",
