Let Y be the number of employees from the fifth branch with more years of service than the employee selected from the first branch. Since there are 20 employees in the first branch, and 60 employees in the fifth branch, the probability that an employee from the first branch has more years of service than an employee from the fifth branch is 20/60=1/3. Therefore, the probability that the employee selected from the first branch has more years of service than the employee selected from the fifth branch is 1/3.\n\n[Output]The solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'referencing_previous_step_value_error', and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 4, which erroneously references the result 10 of step 3 instead of 60, which only results in an error in one operand in the formula, thus it belongs to 'referencing_previous_step_value_error'."

It should be noted that step 1 in the transformed_solution <Total distance travelled is 220km + 110km = 330 km.> should be the same as the step 1 in the original_solution <Total distance travelled is 220km + 110km = 330 km.> and calculates its result 330 km correctly. The change in speed from 110 km/hour to 100 km/hour in step 2 leads to an erroneous calculation of time as 3.3 hours instead of 3 hours. The subsequent step showing the calculated time will reflect this incorrect speed, showing 3.3 hours instead of the correct 3 hours. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the initial distance calculation step is still correct.",

When he walks, he goes 2 MPH. When he runs, he goes 10 MPH. The store is 4 miles away. If he goes on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, what is the average time in minutes that he spends to get to the store?\n\n[Solution]On Sunday he takes 2 hours to get there because 4 / 2 = 2. On Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him .4 hours to get to the store because 4 / 10 = .4. In total it takes him 168 minutes to get to the store because 120 + 24 + 24 = 168. On average it takes him 56 minutes because 168 / 3 = 56.#### 56.\n\nPlease provide an appropriate [Output] for the following case."
