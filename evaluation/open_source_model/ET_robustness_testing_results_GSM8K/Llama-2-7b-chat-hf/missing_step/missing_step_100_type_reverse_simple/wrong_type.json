Since the first step made the calculation for total arson years (12), after removing this step, the following step that originally referenced 12 years now needs to reference the arithmetic from the previous step directly (6 years/count * 2 counts * 2). Similarly, the final step, which calculates the sum of the sentences, shifts from referencing 12 years for arson to directly referencing the arithmetic producing 12 years, effectively changing 12 years to 6 years/count * 2 counts. The resulting sum is 50 years in jail instead of 56.

After removing step 1, step 3's reference to 6300 has no prior context, so it ends up being incorrectly added as an additional number without the correct calculation. To correct step 2 in transformed_solution, which is also step 3 in original_solution, the tuition should be added correctly by multiplying her number of credits by the cost per credit (14 * 450) then adding the result to textbooks and facilities fee. Therefore, the error in the transformed solution occurs in missing the multiplication of 14 credits by the cost per credit, leading to an additional $200 sum in the total for no reason, raising the transformed answer to $7300 instead of the correct $7100. So, the wrong_step is referenced as 2.",
