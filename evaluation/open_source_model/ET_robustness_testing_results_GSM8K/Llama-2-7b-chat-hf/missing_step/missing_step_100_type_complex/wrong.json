In the original_solution, step 1 provides the discount per gallon of milk, which is then used in step 2. With the deletion of step 1, the correct discount of $1 per gallon is no longer applied to the 3 gallons of milk. Instead, the number from the question, which is the largest number referenced in the deleted step 1, should be used for the subsequent related steps. This leads to the erroneous assumption that the discount for 3 gallons of milk would be $3 without properly calculating. The modification of step 2 should have been from $1/gallon x 3 gallons = $3 to $3/gallon x 3 gallons = $9. Instead, the original $3 from step 2 is kept, which does not reflect the deletion of step 1. The total would then be incorrectly calculated in step 2 as $3 + $5 = $8, leading to an incorrect total discount of $8 instead of the correct $11, which is the result of $9 for milk plus $5 for cereal. Thus, the transformed_answer should be $11, but remains erroneously as $8.

Then, the next steps that depended on step 2 are also changed to maintain a logical (but incorrect) flow, adjusting the number of cars given away to 4 and finally concluding that Tom has 6 cars left. It is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 2 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing an incorrect number in the transformed_solution, thus the wrong_step is 1.",

        "question": "Colby harvested his mango trees, the total mangoes he harvested is 60 kilograms. He sold 20 kilograms to the market and sold the remaining half to his community. If each kilogram contains 8 mangoes, how many mangoes does he still have?",
        "original_solution": "He has 60-20= 40 kilograms of mangoes left after selling them to the market.\nColby sold 1/2 x 40 = 20 kilograms of mangoes to the community.\nTherefore, Colby still has 20x8= 160 pieces of mangoes.\n#### 160",
        "original_answer": 160.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Colby sold half the remaining kilograms to his community, 1/2 x 60 = 30 kilograms.\nTherefore, Colby still has 30x8= 240 pieces of mangoes.\n#### 240",

        "explanation": "An intermediate step (original step 1) has been removed. In the original_solution, step 1 calculates the kilograms left after selling to the market, and step 2 references the result of step 1. After deleting step 1, step 2 should have changed from '1/2 x 40' to '1/2 x 60' since the kilograms sold to the community is half the original harvest (60 kilograms) and not half the remaining after the market sale due to the deletion of the first step. Accordingly, step 3 that originally references the result of step 2 (20 kilograms) now references the result of the revised step 2 (30 kilograms), changing from '20x8' to '30x8', leading to a transformed answer of 240. This error is reflected in the first step of the transformed_solution, which in turn affects all subsequent steps, thus wrong_step is 1.",
