This results in 10*2 = 20 barrels of wine per acre per year for the first step, and then for 10 acres, 20*10 = 200 barrels of wine per year for the second step.

Therefore, after deleting step 1, step 2 should reference result 4 from the question. However, instead of using the correct multiplication and addition, there was a mistake in combining the operations, leading to an incorrect new step of 'Walt's Monday and Tuesday walk were 4+4*6 = 52 miles combined.' This is mathematically incorrect because it does not respect the order of operations (multiplication should be done before addition). This incorrect step results in the subsequent step calculating Walt's Wednesday walk by subtracting 52 from 41, yielding an incorrect negative distance. It is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 2 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing incorrect number in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 1.",

The updated formula is 'Jeff completed 16 + 13 + 20 + 8 = 57 skips in total.' This mistake modifies the rest of the calculations, leading to an altered total and average. In step 5, which previously added up Jeff's total skips, the number 15 from step 1 is replaced by 16, the number in the question, adjusting the total.
