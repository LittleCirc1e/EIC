        "explanation": "Here, step 2 mistakenly counts Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday as 2 days instead of 3 days for calculation of average, resulting in the original statement 'So the average distance traveled per day is 51/3 = 17 miles' being changed to 'So the average distance traveled per day is 51/2 = 25.5 miles' in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that the total distance calculation is correct and only the division in the subsequent step is affected by the counting error.",
