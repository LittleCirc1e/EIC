        "question": "There is very little car traffic on Happy Street. During the week, most cars pass it on Tuesday - 25. On Monday, 20% less than on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, 2 more cars than on Monday. On Thursday and Friday, it is about 10 cars each day. On the weekend, traffic drops to 5 cars per day. How many cars travel down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday?",
        "original_solution": "On Monday there are 20/100 * 25 = 5 cars passing the street less than on Tuesday.\nSo on Monday, there are 25 - 5 = 20 cars on Happy Street.\nOn Wednesday, there are 20 + 2 = 22 cars on this street.\nOn Thursday and Friday, there is a total of 10 * 2 = 20 cars passing.\nOn the weekend 5 * 2 = 10 cars are passing.\nSo from Monday through Sunday, there are 20 + 25 + 22 + 20 + 10 = 97 cars traveling down the street.\n#### 97",
        "original_answer": 97.0,
        "transformed_solution": "On Monday there are 20/100 * 25 = 5 cars passing the street less than on Tuesday.\nSo on Monday, there are 25 - 5 = 20 cars on Happy Street.\nOn Wednesday, there are 20 + 2 = 22 cars on this street.\nOn Thursday and Friday, there is a total of 10 * 2 = 20 cars passing.\nOn the weekend 5 * 1 = 5 cars are passing.\nSo from Monday through Sunday, there are 20 + 25 + 22 + 20 + 5 = 92 cars traveling down the street.\n#### 92",
        "transformed_answer": 92.0,
        "wrong_step": 5,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The counting error occurs in step 5, where the original_solution has correctly counted the weekend traffic as 5 cars per day for two days (5 * 2 = 10 cars), but the transformed_solution incorrectly counts it as 5 cars per day for only one day (5 * 1 = 5 cars). This error affects the final calculation in step 6, changing the total count from 97 cars to 92 cars.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. The explanation is that the number of cars passing Happy Street on each day is calculated accurately, and the total number of cars passing from Monday through Sunday is 92."
