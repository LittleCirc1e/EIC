        "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the perimeter and area of a square. The question requires that the area of the triangular sail to be solved be equal to the half of the area of a square with the same height and length.

This incorrect calculation affects the subsequent step 3, which divides the incorrect perimeter in half instead of dividing the correct area in half. The division calculation remains correct, but the input value is wrong due to the previous mistake. All other steps should continue to use correct formulas, ensuring that only one error is introduced in the transformation process. In this example, only step 2 mistakenly confuses the concepts of perimeter and area, while for step 3, division is still correct in form, but it is misapplied based on the incorrect previous step, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",
