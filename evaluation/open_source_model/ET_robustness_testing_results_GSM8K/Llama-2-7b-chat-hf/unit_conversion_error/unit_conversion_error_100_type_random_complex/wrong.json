The output should be the percentage of time Haley spent watching the comet, rounded to the nearest percent.\n\nIn this case, the user must convert Haley's shopping time to minutes, which is 100 minutes, and then convert her setup time to minutes, which is 30 minutes. The total time she spends making snacks is 90 minutes, and the total time is 220 minutes.
