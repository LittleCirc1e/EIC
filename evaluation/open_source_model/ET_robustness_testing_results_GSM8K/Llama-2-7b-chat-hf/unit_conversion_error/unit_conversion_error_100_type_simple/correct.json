        "question": "Marissa's sunflower is 21 inches taller than her little sister. If her sister is 4 feet 3 inches tall, how tall is Marissa's sunflower in feet?",
        "original_solution": "Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, then 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.\nSo, Marissa's sister is 48 + 3 = 51 inches tall.\nThe sunflower is 51 + 21 = 72 inches tall.\nTherefore, the sunflower is 72/12 = 6 feet tall.\n#### 6",
        "original_answer": 6.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Since 1 foot is equal to 10 inches, then 4 feet is equal to 4 x 10 = 40 inches.\nSo, Marissa's sister is 40 + 3 = 43 inches tall.\nThe sunflower is 43 + 21 = 64 inches tall.\nTherefore, the sunflower is 64/10 = 6.4 feet tall.\n#### 6.4",

        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 foot is wrongly equal to 10 inches instead of 12 inches, resulting in 4 feet x 12 inches/foot = 48 inches in the original_solution becoming 4 feet x 10 inches/foot = 40 inches in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 2 and 3, which changes from Marissa's sister being 48 + 3 = 51 inches tall to Marissa's sister being 40 + 3 = 43 inches tall, and the sunflower height from 51 + 21 = 72 inches to 43 + 21 = 64 inches. Finally, step 4 changes from the sunflower being 72/12 = 6 feet tall to the sunflower being 64/10 = 6.4 feet tall. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'unit_conversion_error'. The formula in the first wrong step is correct, but the unit conversion is incorrect. 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, not 10 inches. Therefore, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches, not 40 inches. So, Marissa's sunflower is 48 + 21 = 69 inches tall, not 64 inches tall."

        "question": "Sara builds a birdhouse that is 1 foot wide, 2 feet tall and 2 feet deep. Jake builds a birdhouse that is 16 inches wide, 20 inches tall and 18 inches deep. What is the difference in volume between the two birdhouses?",
        "original_solution": "To compare volumes, the measurements must be in the same units. There are 12 inches in 1 ft, so Sara’s birdhouse is 1 ft x 12 inches/ft = 12 inches wide, 2 ft x 12 inches/ft = 24 inches tall, and 2 ft x 12 inches/ft = 24 inches deep.\nThe volume of Sara’s birdhouse is 12 inches x 24 inches x 24 inches = 6,912 cubic inches\nThe volume of Jake’s birdhouse is 16 inches x 20 inches x 18 inches = 5,760 cubic inches.\nThe difference between the two birdhouses is 6,912 cubic inches – 5,760 cubic inches = 1,152 cubic inches.\n#### 1,152",
