        "transformed_solution": "There are 50 minutes in an hour.\nMicah can type 20 x 50 = 1000 words in an hour.\nIsaiah can type 40 x 50 = 2000 words in an hour.\nIsaiah can type 2000 - 1000 = 1000 words more than Micah in an hour.\n#### 1000",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes an incorrect unit conversion, wrongly stating that there are 50 minutes in an hour instead of 60. This causes the subsequent calculations to use 50 as the multiplier instead of 60. Consequently, Micah's and Isaiah's typing amounts in an hour is calculated with 50 minutes (20 x 50 and 40 x 50), which are 1000 and 2000 words respectively. The final comparison also reflects this change, resulting in Isaiah typing 1000 words more than Micah instead of 1200 with the correct time conversion.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'missing_step'. The first wrong step is missing the step of calculating the total number of words that both Micah and Isaiah can type in an hour. The correct calculation is: Micah can type 20 words per minute x 50 minutes = 1000 words per hour, and Isaiah can type 40 words per minute x 50 minutes = 2000 words per hour. Therefore, the total number of words that both Micah and Isaiah can type in an hour is 1000 + 2000 = 3000 words."

        "original_solution": "Jaydee can type his research paper in 4560/38 = 120 minutes.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, he can finish it in 120/60 = 2 hours.\n#### 2",
        "original_answer": 2.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Jaydee can type his research paper in 4560/38 = 120 minutes.\nSince there are 50 minutes in an hour, he can finish it in 120/50 = 2.4 hours.\n#### 2.4",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 makes an incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 hour is wrongly equal to 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes, resulting in 120/60 = 2 hours in the original_solution becoming 120/50 = 2.4 hours in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 2, which changes from 120/60 = 2 to 120/50 = 2.4. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'calculation_error'. The calculation of the time taken to finish the research paper is correct, but the result is calculated incorrectly. The correct answer is 2.5 hours.\n\nExplanation: The calculation of the time taken to finish the research paper is correct, but the result is calculated incorrectly. The calculation of 4560 words / 38 words per minute = 120 minutes is correct. However, the conversion of minutes to hours is incorrect. There are 60 minutes in an hour, not 50 minutes. Therefore, the correct answer is 2.5 hours."
