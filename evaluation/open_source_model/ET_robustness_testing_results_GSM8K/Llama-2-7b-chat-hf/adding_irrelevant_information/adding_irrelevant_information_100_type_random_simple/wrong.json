        "original_solution": "The reseller wants to get $3000 x 15/100 = $450 profit.\nThus, she needs to sell it for $3000 + $450 = $3450.\n#### 3450",
        "original_answer": 3450.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The reseller wants to get $3000 x 15/100 = $450 profit.\nAdditionally, the reseller wants to include her commission fee which is 5% of the bag's cost, so commission fee is $3000 x 5/100 = $150.\nThus, she needs to sell it for $3000 + $450 + $150 = $3600.\n#### 3600",

        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #1. The reseller wants to get a 15% profit, so she needs to sell the bag for $3000 x 15/100 = $450, which is the profit. Additionally, she wants to include her commission fee, which is 5% of the bag's cost, so the total amount she needs to sell the bag for is $3000 + $450 + $150 = $3600."

        "question": "Linda is painting her bedroom. Her bedroom has 4 walls, with the room being 20 feet wide by 20 feet long by 8 feet tall. One wall has a 3-foot by 7-foot doorway. A second wall has a 6-foot by 4-foot window. A third wall has a 5-foot by 7-foot doorway to a walk-in-closet. And the fourth wall is completely solid.

        "question": "Elmer has a pond that initially contained 2400 pollywogs, but these pollywogs matured into toads and left the pond at a constant rate of 50 pollywogs per day. In addition, Elmer has a son named Melvin, who loves to catch pollywogs, remove them from the pond, and release them into a nearby stream. For the first 20 days, Melvin caught 10 pollywogs per day and released them into the stream. How many days did it take for all of the pollywogs to disappear from the pond?",
