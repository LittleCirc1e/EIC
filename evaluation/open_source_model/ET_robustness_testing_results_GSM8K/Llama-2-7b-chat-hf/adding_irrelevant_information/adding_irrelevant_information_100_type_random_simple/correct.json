        "original_solution": "The price of the juice was 2 * 2 = $4.\nSo in total he paid for his shopping 2 + 3 + 4 = $9.\nThat means he had 15 - 9 = $6 left.\n#### 6",

        "transformed_solution": "The price of the juice was 2 * 2 = $4.\nBecause Paul also bought a chocolate bar for $1, which is not mentioned in the question, so in total he paid for his shopping 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 = $10.\nThat means he had 15 - 10 = $5 left.\n#### 5",

The final result has changed from $6 left in the original_solution to $5 left in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'adding_irrelevant_information'. The explanation is that Paul did not buy a chocolate bar, so the last step is incorrect. The correct answer is $5."
