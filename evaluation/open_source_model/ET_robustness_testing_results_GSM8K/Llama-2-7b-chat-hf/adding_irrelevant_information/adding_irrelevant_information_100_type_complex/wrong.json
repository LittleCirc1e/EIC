When he walks, he goes 2 MPH. When he runs, he goes 10 MPH. The store is 4 miles away. If he goes on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, what is the average time in minutes that he spends to get to the store?\n\n[Solution]On Sunday he takes 2 hours to get there because 4 / 2 = 2. On Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him .4 hours to get to the store because 4 / 10 = .4. In total it takes him 24 minutes to get to the store because .4 x 60 = 24. On average it takes him 56 minutes because 24 / 3 = 56.#### 56.\n\nPlease provide an appropriate [Output] for the following case."
