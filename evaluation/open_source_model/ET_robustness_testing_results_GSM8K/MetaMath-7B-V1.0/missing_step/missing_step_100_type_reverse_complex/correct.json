        "question": "Loisa wants to buy a tablet that costs $450 cash. Since she does not have enough money, the store offered her an installment plan for 12 months. She will pay $100 as a down payment and pay $40 for the first 4 months; then $35 for the next four months; then $30 for the last four months. How much will Loisa save if she will buy the tablet in cash instead of on installment?",
        "original_solution": "Loisa will pay a total of $40 x 4 = $160 for the first 4 months.\nShe will pay a total of $35 x 4 = $140 for the next four months.\nAnd she will pay a total of $30 x 4 = $120 for the last four months.\nThus, she will pay a total of $100 + $160 + $140 + $120 = $520 for 12 months including the down payment.\nTherefore, Loisa can save $520 - $450 = $70 if she buys the tablet in cash.\n#### 70",

        "transformed_solution": "Loisa will pay a total of $40 x 4 = $160 for the first 4 months.\nAnd she will pay a total of $30 x 4 = $120 for the last four months.\nThus, she will pay a total of $100 + $160 + $160 + $120 = $540 for 12 months including the down payment.\nTherefore, Loisa can save $540 - $450 = $90 if she buys the tablet in cash.\n#### 90",

        "explanation": "This example removes the intermediate step 2 from the original_solution, which calculates the total cost of the tablet for the next four months. After removing this step, step 3 of the transformed_solution makes an error by referencing the result $160 from step 1 again instead of the original $140 for the cost of the middle four months. Consequently, the result $540 incorrectly combines $160 twice instead of using $140. The impact of this error is carried forward in the next calculation, which then assesses the total savings as $540 - $450 = $90. The wrong_step is identified as step 3 because it is the first step that uses the incorrect cost reference from the deleted step in the original_solution.",
