        "question": "Ravi can jump higher than anyone in the class. In fact, he can jump 1.5 times higher than the average jump of the three next highest jumpers. If the three next highest jumpers can jump 23 inches, 27 inches, and 28 inches, how high can Ravi jump?",
        "original_solution": "The total height the next three highest can jump is 78 inches because 23 + 27 + 28 = 78\nThe average height they can jump is 26 inches because 78 / 3 = 26\nRavi can jump 39 inches high because 26 x 1.5 = 39\n#### 39",
        "original_answer": 39.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total height the next three highest can jump is 78 inches because 23 + 27 + 28 = 78\nThe average height they can jump is 26 inches because 78 / 3 = 26\nRavi can jump 34.5 inches high because 26 / 1.5 = 17.333333333333332\n#### 17.333333333333332",

        "explanation": "This example turns the multiplication in step 3 into division, and by changing x to /, 26 x 1.5 = 39 becomes 26 / 1.5 = 17.333333333333332. This affects only the result of step 3, making Ravi's jump height incorrectly calculated as 17.333333333333332 inches. The operator change from multiplication to division is incorrect, but the calculation after changing the operator is performed correctly. The changed operator consequentially leads to a different result from the original, which is the transformed_answer.",
        "eval_result": "To determine if the [Solution] is correct, we need to compare it to the given [Question].\nThe [Solution] states that Ravi can jump 1.5 times higher than the average jump of the three next highest jumpers.\nThe average jump of the three next highest jumpers is 26 inches.\nTherefore, Ravi can jump 1.5 * 26 = 39 inches.\nThe [Solution] states that Ravi can jump 34.5 inches.\nTherefore, the [Solution] is incorrect and the wrong type is 'missing_step'.\nThe explanation is: The solution is incorrect, the wrong type"
