        "question": "Suzanne wants to raise money for charity by running a 5-kilometer race. Her parents have pledged to donate $10 for her first kilometer and double the donation for every successive kilometer. If Suzanne finishes the race, how much money will her parents donate?",
        "original_solution": "For the 2nd kilometer, the donation will be $10 * 2 = $20.\nFor the 3rd kilometer, the donation will be $20 * 2 = $40.\nFor the 4th kilometer, the donation will be $40 * 2 = $80.\nFor the final kilometer, the donation will be $80 * 2 = $160.\nFor the entire race the donation will be $10 + $20 + $40 + $80 + $160 = $310.\n#### 310",

        "explanation": "This example changes the operator from multiplication to division only in the first step of the calculation sequence, turning $10 * 2 = $20 into $10 / 2 = $5. This affects the subsequent related steps because the amount of donation for the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and final kilometers is based on the results of previous steps. All subsequent steps correctly use the new values based on the changed operation in the first step, leading to a new final answer. No other aspects of the steps have been changed, ensuring that the calculation is done correctly within the context of the altered operation in the first step.",

This extreme change drastically increases Samaraâ€™s total expenses from $571 to $925225.
