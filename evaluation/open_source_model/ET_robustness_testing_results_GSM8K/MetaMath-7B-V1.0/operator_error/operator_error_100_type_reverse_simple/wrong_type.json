        "original_solution": "John earnt $18 / 2 = $9 on Sunday.\nIn total, John made $18 + $9 + $20 = $47 over the two weekends.\nJohn needs $60 - $47 = $13 extra to buy the pogo stick.\n#### 13",

        "transformed_solution": "John earnt $18 * 2 = $36 on Sunday.\nIn total, John made $18 + $36 + $20 = $74 over the two weekends.\nJohn needs $60 - $74 = -$14 extra to buy the pogo stick.\n#### -14",

        "explanation": "This modification changes the division in step 1 into a multiplication, converting $18 / 2 = $9 to $18 * 2 = $36 by changing / to *. This incorrect operator leads to a higher total earning calculation in step 2, which changes from $18 + $9 + $20 = $47 to $18 + $36 + $20 = $74. Subsequently, step 3, which subtracts the total earnings from the cost of the pogo stick, becomes incorrect due to the wrong amount from step 1. The step now incorrectly calculates that John has exceeded his target by $14 instead of being short. The calculation in each step is correct, but the use of an incorrect operator in step 1 leads to made-up results in the subsequent steps.",
        "eval_result": "To determine if the solution is correct, we need to check if the explanation is correct.\nThe solution states that John needs $14 more to buy the pogo stick.\nThe question asks for the amount of money John needs to earn, not the amount he already earned.\nTherefore, the solution is incorrect because it does not match the question.\nThe correct solution would be:\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is missing_step, which means that the first step to make a mistake is missing.\n#### 14\nThe answer is: 14"
