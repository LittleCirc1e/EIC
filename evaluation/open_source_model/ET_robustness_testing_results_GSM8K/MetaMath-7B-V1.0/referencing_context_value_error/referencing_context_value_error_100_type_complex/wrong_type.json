        "question": "Trip wanted to watch the new action movie in theaters. An evening ticket cost $10 and a large popcorn & drink combo would cost him an additional $10. He noticed on their website, they had a special offer. From 12 noon to 3 pm, save 20% off tickets and 50% off any food combos. How much money could Trip save by going to the earlier movie?",
        "original_solution": "An evening movie is $10 and the food combo would be $10 so 10 + 10 = $20\nIf he goes to an earlier movie, it's 20% off the normal ticket price of $10 so 10 * .20 = $2\nIf he goes to an earlier movie, it's 50% off the normal food price of $10 so 10 * .50 = $5\nIf he saves $2 for the ticket and $5 on food, then 2+5 = $7 saved\n#### 7",
        "original_answer": 7.0,
        "transformed_solution": "An evening movie is $10 and the food combo would be $10 so 10 + 10 = $20\nIf he goes to an earlier movie, it's 20% off the normal ticket price of $15 so 15 * .20 = $3\nIf he goes to an earlier movie, it's 50% off the normal food price of $10 so 10 * .50 = $5\nIf he saves $3 for the ticket and $5 on food, then 3+5 = $8 saved\n#### 8",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 2 references 10 in the question as 15 wrongly, and calculates 15 * .20 = $3 instead of 10 * .20 = $2. This error in step 2 leads to a wrong saving calculation on the ticket in step 4, where 3+5=$8 is calculated instead of 2+5=$7. All subsequent calculations pertaining to this incorrect referencing step are correctly performed using the erroneous result from step 2. Other steps which also reference the price of the ticket still correctly use the original price of $10.",
        "eval_result": "The correct [Solution] is 'The total cost of the ticket and food combo is $10 + $10 = $20.\nIf Trip goes to the earlier movie, he can save 20% off the ticket price, which is $15 * .20 = $3 off.\nHe can also save 50% off the food combo, which is $10 * .50 = $5 off.\nTherefore, the total amount he can save is $3 + $5 = $8.\n#### 8'\nThe following are examples of [Solution] and [Output] for the other two wrong types related to this [Question]. \nFor 'calculation_error', the corresponding wrong [Solution] is ''The first step is the same as the correct [Solution].\nThe total cost of the ticket and food combo is $20.\nIf Trip goes to the earlier movie, he can save 20% off the ticket price, which is $15 * .20 = $3 off.\nHe can also save 50% off the food combo, which is $10 * .50 = $5 off.\nTherefore, the total amount he can save is $3 + $5 = $8.\n#### 8', and your [Output] should be 'The solution is incorrect, the wrong type is calculation_error, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2.
