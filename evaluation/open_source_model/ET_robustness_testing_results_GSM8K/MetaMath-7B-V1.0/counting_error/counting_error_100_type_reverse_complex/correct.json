        "question": "A baker bakes 5 loaves of bread an hour in one oven. He has 4 ovens. From Monday to Friday, he bakes for 5 hours, but on Saturday and Sunday, he only bakes for 2 hours. How many loaves of bread does the baker bake in 3 weeks?",
        "original_solution": "In an hour, the baker bakes 5 x 4 = 20 loaves of bread.\nFrom Monday to Friday, he bakes 5 x 20 = 100 loaves of bread per day.\nFrom Monday to Friday, he bakes a total of 100 x 5 = 500 loaves of bread.\nOn Saturday and Sunday, he bakes 2 x 20 = 40 loaves of bread per day.\nOn Saturday and Sunday, he bakes a total of 40 x 2 = 80 loaves of bread.\nIn a week, he bakes 500 + 80 = 580 loaves of bread.\nIn 3 weeks, he bakes 580 x 3 = 1740 loaves of bread.\n#### 1740",

        "explanation": "Here, in the transformed_solution, step 5 mistakenly counts only Saturday as one day instead of counting both Saturday and Sunday, resulting in 40 x 2=80 changing to 40 x 1=40. This affects step 6, changing the total calculation from 500 + 80=580 to 500 + 40=540. The step for calculating the total for 3 weeks is correctly calculated but based on the incorrect weekly total.
