        "question": "A school is buying virus protection software to cover 50 devices.  One software package costs $40 and covers up to 5 devices. The other software package costs $60 and covers up to 10 devices.  How much money, in dollars, can the school save by buying the $60 software package instead of the $40 software package?",
        "original_solution": "There are 50/5 = 10 sets of 5 devices in the school.\nSo the school will pay a total of $40 x 10 = $400 for the $40 software package.\nThere are 50/10 = 5 sets of 10 devices in the school.\nSo the school will pay a total of $60 x 5 = $300 for the $60 software package.\nThus, the school can save $400 - $300 = $100 from buying the $60 software instead of the $40 software package.\n#### 100",

        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The wrong step occurred in the last step, where the calculation of savings was erroneously stated as $400 - $100 = $300 instead of the correct $400 - $300 = $100 from the original solution. Since the wrong step is at the end of the solution, no subsequent steps are present to inherit the error. The calculation within the step is a deliberate mistake in order to construct a transformed solution with a different answer from the original one.",
        "eval_result": "The correct [Solution] is 'The school can save $300 by buying the $60 software package instead of the $40 software package.\n#### 300'\nThe following are examples of [Solution] and [Output] for the other two wrong types related to this [Question]. \nFor 'missing_step', the corresponding wrong [Solution] is ''The first four steps are the same as the correct [Solution].\nThe school can save $300 by buying the $60 software package instead of the $40 software package.\n#### 300', and your [Output] should be 'The solution is incorrect, the wrong type is missing_step, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 5. Step 5 is missing, so the school cannot determine the amount of money they can save by buying the $60 software package instead of the $40 software package. Therefore, there is no explanation for this case.\nFor 'unit_conversion_error', the corresponding wrong [Solution] is ''The first step is the same as the correct [Solution].\nThe school can save $300 by buying the $60 software package instead of the $40 software package.\n#### 300', and your [Output] should be 'The solution is incorrect, the wrong type is unit_conversion_error, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 performs an incorrect unit conversion and mistakenly assumes that one hour has 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes, so the school cannot determine the amount of money they can save by buying the $60 software package instead of the $40 software package. Therefore, there is no explanation for this case.\nThere is no [Solution] or [Output] for the remaining case.\n#### 300'\nThe value of unknown variable $300 is $300.The answer is: 300"
