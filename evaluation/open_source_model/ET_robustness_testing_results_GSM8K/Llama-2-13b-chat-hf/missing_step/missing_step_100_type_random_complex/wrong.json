The wrong_step is 4 because it is the first step referencing the result from the now-deleted step, which has been transformed to include the original calculation for adult meals.

        "explanation": "This example removes intermediate step 3 about Phil collecting 1 coin every third month. This step references the result 4 from the calculation 12/3. Step 4 in the original_solution references the result from this deleted step 3. Therefore, after deleting step 3, step 4 should not include the 4 coins from step 3. The formula changes from 100+36+4 coins to 100+36 coins, which results in 136 coins before the loss. Subsequent steps 5 and 6 are about losing a quarter of the coins and hence will be modified based on the new total before the loss (136 instead of 140). So, step 5 changes from 140/4=35 coins to 136/4=34 coins, and step 6 changes from 140-35=105 coins to 136-34=102 coins. Step 2 in the transformed_solution references the incorrect total number of coins after the deletion of step 3, serving as the first step referencing an incorrect number. The wrong_step is 2 as this is where the error first appears.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is correct. The explanation is that the first wrong step is step 3. Step 3 adds 3*12 = 36 coins incorrectly, which only results in an operand error in the formula, so it belongs to calculating_error."

However, the correct process is to find the number of orange marbles first before calculating the number of purple marbles as 4 times the orange marbles. The subsequent step also changes: it no longer includes orange marbles in the total count, making the formula change from 13+4+16=33 to 13+16=29. Despite the incorrect process, the math in step 2 is internally consistent, but it fails to account for the orange marbles due to the omission of the first step.
