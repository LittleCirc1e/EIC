He realizes first he has to get in shape to do it and it takes him 2 years of working out to get healthy enough to take up mountain climbing. He then spends twice that long learning how to be a technically proficient mountain climber. After that he starts with the simplest mountain on the list and climbs them all.

Step 4 of the original_solution, which references the result '4 years' from the deleted Step 1, gets modified. The time spent preparing and learning to dive (2 years + 13 months) remains unaltered. However, since step 1 was removed, the total years cannot include the 4 years from the removed step. The new calculation in the transformed_solution should be the initial 2 years of working out, plus 4 years of mountaineering (calculated from the 48 months), plus 2 years of diving education, plus 2 years of actual diving, equaling 10 years in total.
