        "question": "Joseph had socks of many different colors. His dresser drawer was filled to overflowing with red, blue, black, and white socks. Uncertain of how many pairs he had of each color, he began to sort his socks. He discovered that he had three more pairs of blue socks than he had pairs of black socks. He had one less pair of red socks than he had pairs of white socks. He had twice as many blue socks as he had of red socks. And he counted a total of 6 red socks. What is the total number of Joseph's socks?",
        "original_solution": "Starting with 6 red socks, twice the number of blue socks as red meant Joseph had 2*6=12 blue socks.\nWith one less pair of red socks than white socks, this meant 2 fewer red socks than white, for a total of 6-2=4 white socks.\nAlso, 12 blue socks=6 pairs of blue socks.\nWith three more pairs of blue socks than pairs of black socks, this means he had 6-3=3 pairs of black socks.\nAnd three pairs of black socks corresponds to 3*2=6 black socks.\nThus, in total, he had 6+12+4+6=28 socks.\n#### 28",

After deleting this step, step 5 instantaneously refers to the number of blue socks pairs by dividing by 2 (since 1 pair equals 2 socks), which changes the formula from 6-3=3 pairs of black socks to 6/2-3=0 pairs of black socks. The change leads to calculating 0 black socks instead of 6, and the remaining steps that calculate the total number of socks refer to this new value. Therefore, removing step 4 causes a fundamental miscalculation in the number of black socks, leading to the first erroneous reference at step 5 in the transformed solution. It should be noted that the number 3 from step 5, referring to how many fewer pairs of black socks there are compared to blue, remains intact as the required reference from the question.
