        "question": "The last time Bob cut his hair he cut it to 6 inches.  His hair is now 36 inches long.  If hair grows at a rate of .5 inches per month how many years did it take him to grow out his hair?",
        "original_solution": "His hair grew 36 inches - 6 inches = 30 inches\nHair grows at a rate of 12 months/year * 0.5 inches/month =6 inches/year\nIt took him 30 inches / 6 inches/year = 5 years to grow his hair out.\n#### 5",
        "original_answer": 5.0,
        "transformed_solution": "His hair grew 36 inches * 12 months/year = 432 inches\nIt took him 432 inches / 0.5 inches/month = 864 months to grow his hair out.\n864 months / 12 months/year = 72 years\n#### 72",
        "transformed_answer": 72.0,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In the transformed_solution, the first step is altered and contains a mathematically incorrect operation. Instead of subtracting the starting length from the current length (36 inches - 6 inches), the current length is incorrectly multiplied by the number of months in a year (36 inches * 12 months/year), leading to a result of 432 inches. The transformed solution's step 1 results in an incorrect calculation that does not represent the hair growth correctly, therefore directly leading to the wrong answer that it took 72 years for Bob to grow out his hair. The sequence of steps in the transformed_solution erroneously inflated the hair growth, directly affecting the subsequent computations, which are also incorrect but follow from the initial error in step 1. The error is classified as a calculation error and wrong_step is identified as 1 because that is where the first incorrect operation occurred.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'calculation_error', and the explanation is:\n\nThe solution is incorrect because the calculation of 36 inches * 12 months/year is incorrect. The product of 36 inches and 12 months is 432 months, not 432 inches. Therefore, the calculation of 432 months / 0.5 inches/month is also incorrect, and the final answer of 72 years is incorrect. The correct calculation is 432 months / 0.5 inches/month = 864 months, and the correct final answer is 864 months / 12 months/year = 72 months, not 72 years."
