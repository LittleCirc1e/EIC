        "explanation": "Here, step 3 incorrectly counts Thursday and Friday as 1 day instead of 2 days, resulting in 2 * 2 = 4 hours of work being erroneously transformed into 1 * 2 = 2 hours of work. This error affects both step 3 and the subsequent step 4, which then calculates the distance for Thursday and Friday as 2 * 9 = 18 kilometers instead of 4 * 9 = 36 kilometers. The final step calculates the total distance as 72 + 18 = 90 kilometers instead of the correct 72 + 36 = 108 kilometers. The counting error is isolated to the modification of the working hours for Thursday and Friday, and the remaining calculations are completed correctly based on the wrong counting result.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is correct. The explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 adds the time the driver worked on Thursday and Friday incorrectly as 2 hours, which only results in an error in one operand in the formula, so it belongs to adding_irrelevant_information."
