        "question": "The stadium seats 60,000 fans, but only 75% of the seats were sold for the music show. Because of the threat of rain, 5,000 fans stayed home. How many attended the show?",
        "original_solution": "The number of seats sold was 0.75*60,000=45,000.\nAnd 45,000-5,000=40,000.\n#### 40,000",
        "original_answer": 40000.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The number of seats sold was 0.75*60,000=45,000.\nAnd 45,000-5,000=35,000.\n#### 35,000",

        "explanation": "The example mistakenly calculates 45,000-5,000=35,000 instead of 45,000-5,000=40,000 in step 2. The error in the subtraction at step 2 affects only the final answer, not the initial calculation of seats sold (step 1). Note that the transformed solution only has one calculation error introduced, and subsequent steps correctly use the result from the erroneous step, following the pattern of inheriting the error.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is calculation_error, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2. The operands and operators of the formula in step 2 are completely correct, but only the result is incorrectly calculated as 35,000 instead of 40,000, so it belongs to calculation_error."
