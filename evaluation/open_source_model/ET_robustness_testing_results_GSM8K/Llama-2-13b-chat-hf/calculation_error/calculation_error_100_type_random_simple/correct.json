        "original_solution": "The total time taken for the whole journey is 9:00-6:00 = 3 hours.\nThe total time taken in minutes is 3*60 = 180 minutes.\nIf it takes 40 minutes to reach the first station, then the rest of the journey takes 180 - 40 = 140 minutes.\n#### 140",

        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, step 3 has been altered from \"180 - 40 = 140 minutes\" to \"180 - 40 = 130 minutes.\" This is a calculation error affecting only this step. The preceding steps remain unchanged, as they are not dependent on the outcome of step 3. The transformation process involves making a single calculation error in step 3, which leads to a different transformed_answer from the original_answer.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'calculation_error', and the explanation is as follows:\n\nThe total time taken for the whole journey is 9:00-6:00 = 3 hours, which is correct. However, the total time taken in minutes is calculated as 3*60 = 180 minutes, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should be 3*60 = 1800 minutes, not 180 minutes.\n\nThe rest of the journey takes 1800 - 40 = 1760 minutes, not 130 minutes. Therefore, the final answer should be 1760 minutes, not 130 minutes"

There are no other errors introduced in the transformation process, so this is a single error. The incorrect result from step 2 does not affect the previous step (step 1), and there are no subsequent steps that depend on the output of step 2.

        "explanation": "This example changes the calculation of interest in step 1 by wrongly calculating it as 0.1*1200=$100 instead of 0.1*1200=$120. This change goes on to impact step 2, which relies on the result of step 1 for its calculation. So, instead of the correct sum of 1200+120=$1320, after the change it is calculated as 1200+100=$1300. All other elements not reliant on step 1 remain unaffected, and the error is propagated to the sum in step 2, leading to a different total repayment amount of $1300.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nPlease determine if the solution is correct. In the solution, each \n represents a step, and the number after #### represents the final answer. You need to first determine which is the first step to make a mistake, and then determine which of wrong types it belongs to.\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'calculation_error', and the explanation is: The interest on the loan should be calculated as 0.1*1200=120, not 0.1*1200=100. The total amount Jack needs to pay back is 1200+120=1320, not 1200+100=1300. Therefore, the correct answer is #### 1320."
