        "question": "Maddox and Theo both bought 3 Polaroid Cameras, each sold at $20 per camera from Amazon, and decided to sell them on eBay. Maddox sold his cameras at $28 each, while Theo sold his cameras at $23 each. How much more profit did Maddox get from the sale of his cameras than Theo?",
        "original_solution": "The total cost of buying 3 cameras from Amazon for both Maddox and Theo was 3*$20=$60\nMaddox sold his cameras at $28 each, for a total of $28*3=$84\nMaddox made a profit of $84-$60=$24 from the sale of his cameras.\nTheo sold his cameras on eBay for $23*3=$69\nTheo made a profit of $69-$60=$9\nMaddox made $24-$9=$15 more profit than Theo from the sale of his cameras.\n#### 15",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The miscalculation occurs at step 4, where the total sales for Theo’s cameras are incorrectly calculated as $23*3=$59 instead of $23*3=$69. This error affects Theo’s profit calculation in step 5, changing the correct profit from $9 to -$1, and further affects the comparison of Maddox’s profit to Theo’s profit in step 6, resulting in an incorrect higher profit for Maddox of $25 instead of $15.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is correct. The explanation is that Maddox sold his cameras at a higher price than Theo, resulting in a higher profit. Maddox made a profit of $24 from the sale of his cameras, while Theo made a profit of $1 less than Maddox, resulting in a difference of $25."

The other software package costs $60 and covers up to 10 devices.  How much money, in dollars, can the school save by buying the $60 software package instead of the $40 software package?",
        "original_solution": "There are 50/5 = 10 sets of 5 devices in the school.\nSo the school will pay a total of $40 x 10 = $400 for the $40 software package.\nThere are 50/10 = 5 sets of 10 devices in the school.\nSo the school will pay a total of $60 x 5 = $300 for the $60 software package.\nThus, the school can save $400 - $300 = $100 from buying the $60 software instead of the $40 software package.\n#### 100",
