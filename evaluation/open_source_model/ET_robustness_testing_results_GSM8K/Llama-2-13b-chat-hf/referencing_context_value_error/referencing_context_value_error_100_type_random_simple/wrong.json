The first wrong step is the calculation of the total value of the cheaper cards, which is 30*30=$900 instead of 30*30=$9000. This error is referenced the result of its previous step, which is the total value of the cards worth $5900."

The correct formula should be $28 + $5 = $33, not $20 x 2 = $40. Therefore, the answer is $11, not $44."
