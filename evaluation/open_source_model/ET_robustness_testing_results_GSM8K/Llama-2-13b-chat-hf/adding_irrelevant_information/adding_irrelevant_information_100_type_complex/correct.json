        "question": "Mark needs to replace the radiator in his car. The work takes 2 hours and the mechanic charges $75 an hour. The part cost $150. How much did he pay?",
        "original_solution": "He had to pay for 2 hours of labor, which cost 2*$75=$150\nSo the total cost was $150+$150=$300\n#### 300",
        "original_answer": 300.0,
        "transformed_solution": "He had to pay for 2 hours of labor, which cost 2*$75=$150\nBecause there was an additional $30 service fee, the total cost was $150+$150+$30=$330\n#### 330",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 2 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <Because there was an additional $30 service fee>, resulting in step 2 changing from $150+$150=$300 in the original_solution to $150+$150+$30=$330 in the transformed_solution. The final result is affected by this added information, changing the total cost from $300 to $330. It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is adding_irrelevant_information, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 3. Step 3 adds the part cost of $150 to the total cost, which is not included in the question statement. Therefore, the correct total cost is only the labor cost of $150, and the answer should be $150 instead of $330."
