        "original_solution": "Soccer Stars won and lost a total of 14+2 = 16 games.\nThis means they drew 20 - 16 = 4 games.\nThe total points from the wins are 14*3 = 42 points.\nThe total points from draws are 4*1 = 4 points.\nThe total points from the losses are 2 * 0 = 0 points.\nThey had 42+4+0 = 46 points when the season ended.\n#### 46",

        "explanation": "This example turns the addition in step 1 into subtraction, and by changing + to -, '14+2 = 16' becomes '14-2 = 12'. This affects the subsequent related step 2. Step 2 changes from '20 - 16 = 4' to '20 - 12 = 8'. Subsequent related step 4 is also affected, where '4*1 = 4 points' changes to '8*1 = 8 points'. Finally, the total points change in step 6 from '42+4+0 = 46 points' to '42+8+0 = 50 points'. It should be noted that only the operator in step 1 is incorrect, but its calculation is correct, which leads to its result being incorrect. This affects step 2 and step 4 that use its result, but all calculations are correct.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #3, 'unit_conversion_error'. The solution correctly calculates the total points from the wins and draws, but it does not convert the number of games won and drawn to the correct units. For example, the solution states that the team won 14 games, but it should be 14 matches, as a game is a single match. Similarly, the solution states that the team drew 8 games, but it should be 8 matches. By converting the number of games to the correct units, the solution would be:\n\nThe total points from the wins are 1"
