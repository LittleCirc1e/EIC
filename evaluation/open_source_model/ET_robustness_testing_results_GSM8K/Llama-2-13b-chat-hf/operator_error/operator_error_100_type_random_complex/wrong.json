Consequently, the calculation in step 2 using Kris's incorrect turtle count, \"Trey has 48*7 = 336 turtles\", is correct given the modified step 1 but results in an incorrect number of turtles for Trey. Likewise, step 3 now uses the inflated turtle count for Trey, resulting in \"Trey has 336-12 = 324 more turtles than Kristen\". Each step after the initial operator error is calculated correctly based on the altered values from the previous step.
