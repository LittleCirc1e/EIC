        "question": "Jeremy is driving 600 miles to visit his parents. His average speed for this trip is 50 miles per hour. Every two hours of driving, he makes a rest stop for 15 minutes. His car gets 18 miles per gallon of gas, and his gas indicator comes on when he's used 15 gallons, at which point he stops to refill, which takes 10 minutes. How long, in minutes, does he take to get to his parents' house, if he starts out with a full tank of gas?",
        "original_solution": "Jeremy is driving 600 miles, at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, so he will be driving for 600 miles / 50 miles per hour = 12 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 720 minutes.\nHe makes a rest stop every 2 hours of driving, at 2, 4, 6, 8 & 10 hours in = 5 rest stops on the trips.\nEach rest stop takes 15 minutes so he will spend 5 rest stops * 15 minutes per rest stop = 75 minutes on rest stops.\nHis car gets 18 miles to the gallon, and he stops to refill every 15 gallons, so he will stop to refill every 18 miles per gallon * 15 gallons = 270 miles.\n600 miles / 270 miles per refuel = 2.22 refuels, so he'll only make 2 refuels during the trip.\nHe will spend 2 refuels * 10 minute per refuel = 20 minutes refueling his car.\nIn total he will take 720 minutes driving + 75 minutes resting + 20 minutes refueling = 815 minutes.\n#### 815",

        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this transformed solution, an incorrect unit conversion is made in step 1, which assumes that 1 hour has 50 minutes instead of the correct 60 minutes. This results in the calculation of driving time changing from 12 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 720 minutes in the original solution to 12 hours * 50 minutes per hour = 600 minutes in the transformed solution. Subsequent related steps concerning the total time taken, including rest stops and refueling, are all correctly calculated based on this initial error, leading to a different final answer of 695 minutes as compared to the original answer of 815 minutes. The error is limited to the initial unit conversion, subsequent calculations that hinge on this error are correct, which aligns with the requirement for a single error change.",

        "question": "Luke is planning a trip to London and wants to see how long it will take him to travel there. He decides that he will take a bus to the town center, walk for 15 minutes to the train center, wait twice this long for the train to arrive, and then take the 6-hour train ride to London. If Luke’s entire trip takes him 8 hours, how many minutes does his bus ride take?",
        "original_solution": "Removing the time of the train ride from the journey shows that his trip to get on the train took him 8 hours – 6 hours = 2 hours.\nConverting this time into minutes shows that getting to the train took 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.\nWaiting for the train to arrive took twice as long as his walk, so 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes.\nThis means that his bus ride must have taken 120 minutes – 30 minutes - 15 minutes = 75 minutes.\n#### 75",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In step 2 of the original_solution, an incorrect unit conversion was introduced by changing the number of minutes in an hour from 60 to 50. Therefore, the original 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes is transformed to 2 hours * 50 minutes/hour = 100 minutes. This affected the subsequent related step 4, changing 120 minutes – 30 minutes - 15 minutes = 75 minutes to the incorrect 100 minutes – 30 minutes - 15 minutes = 55 minutes. The transformed_answer is calculated based on this incorrect unit conversion, giving a result of 55 minutes for the bus ride instead of the correct 75 minutes.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is correct. The explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 confuses the perimeter and area formulas of rectangle and it should calculate the area of the rectangle which is equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the length plus length plus width plus width, equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle. So it belongs to confusing_formula_error.\n\nPlease provide another [Question] and its correct [Solution].\n\n"
