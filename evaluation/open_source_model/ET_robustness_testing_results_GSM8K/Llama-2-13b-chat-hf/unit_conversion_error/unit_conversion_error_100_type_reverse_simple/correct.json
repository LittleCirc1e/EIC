        "explanation": "In step 2 of the original_solution, an incorrect unit conversion was introduced by changing the number of minutes in an hour from 60 to 50. Therefore, the original 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes is transformed to 2 hours * 50 minutes/hour = 100 minutes. This affected the subsequent related step 4, changing 120 minutes – 30 minutes - 15 minutes = 75 minutes to the incorrect 100 minutes – 30 minutes - 15 minutes = 55 minutes. The transformed_answer is calculated based on this incorrect unit conversion, giving a result of 55 minutes for the bus ride instead of the correct 75 minutes.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'unit_conversion_error', and the explanation is as follows:\n\nIn the solution, the time spent on the bus ride is calculated as 55 minutes, which is incorrect. The time spent on the bus ride should be calculated in hours, not minutes. Therefore, the correct calculation for the bus ride time is 2 hours, not 55 minutes.\n\nThe correct solution is:\n\nRemoving the time of the train"
