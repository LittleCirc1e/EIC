        "original_solution": "First find the number of seconds in an hour: 1 hour * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 3600 seconds/hour.\nThen divide the total number of seconds per hour by the number of seconds it takes Janet to read one post: 3600 seconds/hour / 10 seconds/post = 360 posts/hour.\nThen multiply the number of posts she checks per hour by her pay per post to find her hourly pay: $0.25/post * 360 posts/hour = $90/hour.\n#### 90",
        "original_answer": 90.0,
        "transformed_solution": "First find the number of seconds in an hour: 1 hour * 50 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 3000 seconds/hour.\nThen divide the total number of seconds per hour by the number of seconds it takes Janet to read one post: 3000 seconds/hour / 10 seconds/post = 300 posts/hour.\nThen multiply the number of posts she checks per hour by her pay per post to find her hourly pay: $0.25/post * 300 posts/hour = $75/hour.\n#### 75",

        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 hour wrongly has 50 minutes instead of the correct 60 minutes, resulting in 1 hour * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 3600 seconds/hour in the original_solution becoming 1 hour * 50 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 3000 seconds/hour in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 2 and 3, which changes from 3600 seconds/hour / 10 seconds/post = 360 posts/hour to 3000 seconds/hour / 10 seconds/post = 300 posts/hour, and then from $0.25/post * 360 posts/hour = $90/hour to $0.25/post * 300 posts/hour = $75/hour in transformed_solution. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, so the other calculation processes remain correct.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is correct. The explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 divides the total number of seconds per hour by the number of seconds it takes Janet to read one post instead of multiplying the number of posts she checks per hour by her pay per post, which only results in an error in one operand in the formula, thus it belongs to calculation_error."
