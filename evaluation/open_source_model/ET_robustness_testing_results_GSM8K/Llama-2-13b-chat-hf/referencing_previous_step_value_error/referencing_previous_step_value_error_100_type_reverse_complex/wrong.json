It should be noted that step 2 in the transformed_solution <She read three fewer books in August than she did in July, so she read 16 - 3 = 13 books in August.> should be the same as the step 2 in the original_solution <She read three fewer books in August than she did in July, so she read 16 - 3 = 13 books in August.> and calculates its result 13 correctly.
