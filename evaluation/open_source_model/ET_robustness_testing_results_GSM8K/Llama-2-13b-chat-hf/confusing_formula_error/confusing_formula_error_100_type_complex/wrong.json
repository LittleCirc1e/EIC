The question asked for the area, which should be found by multiplying the length (L) by the width (W), but instead, the perimeter formula (L + W) was mistakenly used in the transformed_solution, which is typically the sum of all sides of the rectangle. As a result, the original solution's equation '100 = L * W' turned into '100 = L + W' in the transformed solution. This causes a chain reaction affecting the subsequent calculations. W is incorrectly found to be 20 instead of 5, and L is calculated as being 80 instead of 20. The previous steps and language remain unaltered, and the error results in a different final answer in the transformed_solution.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is correct.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe solution is correct because the formula for the area of a rectangle is A = L + W, and the given information is that the length is four times the width, so L = 4W.
