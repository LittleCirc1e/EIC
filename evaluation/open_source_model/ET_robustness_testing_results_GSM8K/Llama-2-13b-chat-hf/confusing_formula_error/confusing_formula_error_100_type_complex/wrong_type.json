It's important to note that only step 1 has been modified to introduce the confusing formula error, affecting the related step 2, while no language description has been changed.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is calculating_error, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 calculates the volume of the marble statue as 2+2+2+2=8 cubic meters, but the correct formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height, not the sum of the lengths of the sides. Therefore, the volume of the marble statue should be 8 x 2 x 2 = 16 cubic meters, and the weight should be 2700 x 16 = 43,200 kg, not 21,600 kg."
