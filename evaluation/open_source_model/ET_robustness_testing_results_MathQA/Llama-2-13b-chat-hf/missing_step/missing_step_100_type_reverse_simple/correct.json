Therefore, subsequent steps need to start with the simplified form 2(x-390) and solve for x accordingly. Step 3 now directly equates 2(x-390) with 2x + 780, instead of 2x - 780 = 2x + 780. As a result, the subtraction operation in step 4 is incorrect, but it still reveals that the equation 2x - 780 = 2x + 780 cannot hold true unless the extra bananas (780) is balanced out by an equal amount on the other side of the equation (-780 = 780). Hence, in step 5, instead of equating -780 to 390, it should equate -780 to 780 to maintain this balance. Step 6 then incorrectly solves for x by dividing 780 by 2, which yields the incorrect answer of x = 390. The wrong_step is 2 because that is the first step in the transformed solution that incorrectly references the result of the deleted step (step 2 in the original solution).",

        "explanation": "In this example, the first step is deleted. The original_solution's step 1 references the number 5 and 15 from the question, but step 1's result is not referenced by any subsequent steps directly. However, deleting it means step 2 would be invalid as it stands. By altering step 2 to reference-the largest number referenced in the original step 1, which is 15, the formula changes from 5/15 = 1/3 to 15/15 = 1, thereby eliminating the entire calculation process as 1 - 1 equals 0. All subsequent steps then reflect the calculation based on zero remaining work, leading to a transformed answer of 0 days for x to finish the 'remaining' work, which mistakenly implies no work is left. It is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 2 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing incorrect number in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 1.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'missing_step', and the explanation is: The solution is missing a step that calculates the amount of work done by y in 5 days. To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the amount of work done by y in 5 days, which is (1/15) \\* 5 = 1/3 of the total work. Then, we can subtract the amount of work done by y from the total work to find the amount of work remaining, which is 1 - 1/3 = 2/3. Finally, we can divide the amount of work remaining by the rate at which x can finish the work per day to find the number of days x needs to finish the remaining work, which is 2/3 / (1/21) = 21 days. Therefore, the correct solution is: x alone needs 21 days to finish the remaining work."

In the original_solution, step 1 references the original number of men x, and step 2 references the result of step 1, the equation 20x = 22(x-2). Therefore, after deleting step 1, step 2 should become the first step and no longer reference the original number of men explicitly but rather model the same equation directly. Step 3 references the result 20x from step 2. After deleting step 1, step 3 is adjusted to reference 20(x-2) from the new first step and changes the formula from 20x = 22x - 44 to 20x - 40 = 22x - 44. Similarly, Step 4 is adjusted based on the new step 3, and becomes 44 - 40 = 22x - 20x. The final step is then updated based on step 4 and arrives at the incorrect conclusion of x = 2. It is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 2 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step that contains incorrect referencing due to the removal of the original step 1.",
