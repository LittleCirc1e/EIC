        "explanation": "The modified transformed_solution incorrectly assumes that 63 is the next prime number after 59. Since intermediate step 1 (identifying the sequence as a prime number sequence) has been deleted, step 2 should directly state the next prime number after 59. However, instead of correctly identifying 61 as the next prime number, it incorrectly states 63, which is not a prime number. Consequently, the subsequent answer is also incorrect. Step 1 in the transformed_solution references the wrong number and therefore is considered the wrong step.",
