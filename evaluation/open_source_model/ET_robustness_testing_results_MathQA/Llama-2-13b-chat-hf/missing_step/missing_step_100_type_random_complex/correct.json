After deleting step 3, step 4 is repeated as it is not needed anymore because we're not comparing the two speeds. The correct comparison step (calculating the equality of the two expressions for speed) is omitted, leading to an incorrect continuation from the assumption that both platforms will have the same speed equation, which doesn't hold true and isn't logically consistent. This propagation of error goes from step 3 to 4, and from there, the incorrect speed equivalence is used to falsely deduce that x, the length of the train, is -250 meters, which is not physically possible. Thus, the wrong step is identified as step 3, where the speed equivalence should have been first established.",
