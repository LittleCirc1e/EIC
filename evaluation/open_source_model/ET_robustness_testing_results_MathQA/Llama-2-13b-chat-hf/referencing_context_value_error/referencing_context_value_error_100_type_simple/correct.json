Its subsequent related steps will be affected as they rely on the initial value of x; however, all calculations will be performed correctly with the erroneous starting point of x = 5. Step 2 will calculate the difference between x and 4/7 as 5 - 4/7 = 35/7 - 4/7, and step 3 will calculate the percentage correctly based on the incorrect x value, resulting in (31/7) / (4/7) * 100% = (31/4) * 100% = 775%.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'referencing_context_value_error', and the explanation is: In the first step, the formula (1/7)x = 1 is incorrect because the context value of 1/7 is not correctly referenced. The correct formula should be (1/7)x = 4/7, which leads to the correct answer of 31/7 - 4/7 = 27/7, not 31/7. Therefore, the final answer is 27/7 * 100% = 375%, not 775%."

The error occurs again in the subtraction step (4/5 * x - 5/5 * x = 12), resulting in an arithmetic error that leads to a negative time, which doesn't make sense in the real-world context. As this is the root error, only this step is considered incorrect, and the following steps correctly apply the erroneous result from this step: Step 4 correctly subtracts -5/5 * x from 4/5 * x, giving -1/5 * x = 12, and Step 5 correctly solves for x, getting x = -60.
