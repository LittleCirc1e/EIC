        "original_solution": "First, we need to convert the speed from km/hr to m/s. 54 km/hr = 54 x 1000 / 3600 = 15 m/s.\nNext, we need to calculate the total distance the train needs to cover, which is 360 m + 140 m = 500 m.\nNow, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time it takes for the train to pass the bridge. Time = 500 m / 15 m/s = 33.33 seconds.\n#### 33.33",
        "original_answer": 33.33,
        "transformed_solution": "First, we need to convert the speed from km/hr to m/s. 50 km/hr = 50 x 1000 / 3600 = 13.89 m/s.\nNext, we need to calculate the total distance the train needs to cover, which is 360 m + 140 m = 500 m.\nNow, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time it takes for the train to pass the bridge.

        "wrong_type": "referencing_context_value_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 1 references 54 km/hr in the question as 50 km/hr wrongly, and calculates 50 x 1000 / 3600 = 13.89 m/s instead of 54 x 1000 / 3600 = 15 m/s. Its subsequent related step will be affected, calculating the time as 500 m / 13.89 m/s = 36.01 seconds instead of 500 m / 15 m/s = 33.33 seconds in step 3. Please note that you should only consider one error, so step 2 still references 360 m and 140 m in the question correctly.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'unit_conversion_error', and the explanation is: In the first step, the speed of the train should be converted to meters per second instead of kilometers per hour. The correct conversion is 50 km/hr = 50 x 1000 / 3600 = 13.89 m/s.\n\nThe solution is incorrect because the formula time = distance / speed is not appropriate for this problem. The correct formula is time = distance / acceleration, where acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. In this case, the acceleration of the train is not given,"
