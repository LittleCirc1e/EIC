        "explanation": "Step 1 references 50 percent in the question as 60 percent wrongly, calculating 0.6x for the amount spent on clothing instead of the correct 0.5x. This error affects the computation of the tax paid on clothing in step 4, leading to a miscalculation of the tax amount as 0.024x instead of 0.02x. Consequently, the erroneous tax values affect the total tax computation in step 6, changing the total tax from 0.044x to 0.048x, and affecting the final percentage calculation in step 8. Note that the numbers for the other items and their tax rates are referenced correctly, and it's the first erroneous step that causes all subsequent related steps to inherit its erroneous result, though they are computed correctly based on the wrong value provided.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is correct. The explanation is that the total tax as a percent of the total amount spent is calculated by dividing the total amount spent on taxes by the total amount spent, excluding taxes, and then multiplying by 100. In this case, the total amount spent on taxes is 4.8% of the total amount spent, excluding taxes."
