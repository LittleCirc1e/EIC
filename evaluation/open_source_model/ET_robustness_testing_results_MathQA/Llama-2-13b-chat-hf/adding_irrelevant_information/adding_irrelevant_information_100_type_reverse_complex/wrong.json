        "original_solution": "First convert the speed from km/hr to m/s: 45 km/hr x (1000 m/1 km) x (1 hr/3600 s) = 12.5 m/s\nTotal distance to be covered = length of train + length of bridge = 360 m + 240 m = 600 m\nTime = Distance/Speed = 600 m / 12.5 m/s = 48 s\n#### 48 s",

        "transformed_solution": "First convert the speed from km/hr to m/s: 45 km/hr x (1000 m/1 km) x (1 hr/3600 s) = 12.5 m/s\nTotal distance to be covered = length of train + length of bridge + an additional length of 60 m maintenance work on the bridge = 360 m + 240 m + 60 m = 660 m\nTime = Distance/Speed = 660 m / 12.5 m/s = 52.8 s\n#### 52.8 s",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 2 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <an additional length of 60 m maintenance work on the bridge>, resulting in step 2 changing from length of train + length of bridge = 360 m + 240 m = 600 m in the original_solution to length of train + length of bridge + an additional length of 60 m maintenance work on the bridge = 360 m + 240 m + 60 m = 660 m in the transformed_solution. The final calculation has thus been affected, altering the total distance and corresponding time required to pass the bridge and leading to a different result.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is correct. The explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 mistakenly converts the speed from km/hr to m/s without considering the conversion factor of 1000 m/1 km, which only results in an error in one operand in the formula, thus it belongs to calculation_error."

        "original_solution": "Let the cost price be $100.\nHe labeled the price at a 30% markup, so the labeled price is 100 + 30% of 100 = 100 + 30 = $130.\nHe offered a 10% discount on the labeled price, so the selling price is 130 - 10% of 130 = 130 - 13 = $117.\nHis actual profit is 117 - 100 = $17.\nHis actual percent profit is (17/100) x 100% = 17%.\n#### 17%",
