The final calculation has thus been affected, altering the total distance and corresponding time required to pass the bridge and leading to a different result.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'unit_conversion_error', and the explanation is: In the first step, the speed of the train should be converted from km/hr to m/s, but the formula used is incorrect. The correct formula is: 45 km/hr x (1000 m/1 km) = 45000 m/3600 s = 12.5 m/s. The additional length of 60 m for maintenance work on the bridge should not be included in the calculation. Therefore, the correct time is: 660 m / 12.5 m/s = 52.8 s."
