The subsequent step 3 is affected by step 2 and incorrectly calculates the total sum to 28 + 52 = 80 instead of 28 + 56 = 84.

It should be noted that step 2 in the transformed_solution <Total distance to cover = length of the train + length of the bridge = 360 m + 140 m = 500 m> should be the same as step 2 in the original_solution and calculates its result 500 m correctly.

The explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2, which mistakenly converts the speed from km/hr to m/s without considering the conversion factor of 1000 m/km.
