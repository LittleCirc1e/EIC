        "original_solution": "Convert 65 min to hours: 65 / 60 = 1.083 hours\nCalculate the distance: 60 x 1.083 = 65 km\nNew speed is 60 + 5 = 65 km/hr\nTime taken with new speed: 65 / 65 = 1 hour\n#### 1 hour",

        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references the increased average speed as 70 km/hr from the previous step instead of 65 km/hr and changes 65 / 65 = 1 hour to 70 / 65 = 1.077 hours. It should be noted that step 3 in the transformed_solution <New speed is 60 + 5 = 65 km/hr> should be the same as the step 3 in the original_solution <New speed is 60 + 5 = 65 km/hr> and calculates its result 65 km/hr correctly. The erroneous step 4 results in a miscalculated time taken with the new speed, but since we only consider one step error, all other steps that reference these numbers still reference them correctly. Furthermore, the transformed_answer should be different from the original_answer, which is achieved with the mistake in referencing.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is correct. The explanation is that the first step is to convert 65 minutes to hours, which is done correctly. The second step is to calculate the distance traveled by the bus, which is also correct. The third step is to calculate the new speed of the bus, which is done correctly. The fourth step is to calculate the time taken to cover the same distance with the new speed, which is also correct. Therefore, the solution is correct, and the output should be 'The solution is correct, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 1. Step 1 does not convert the time traveled from minutes to hours, but directly adds up the time and distance, which only results in an error in one operand in the formula, thus it belongs to missing_step.'"
