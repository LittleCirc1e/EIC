        "explanation": "Step 1 mistakenly calculates the power 1.003^4 as 1.009 instead of 1.012. This is a calculation error, as the power was incorrectly calculated. The exponentiation should be computed correctly using proper arithmetic to ensure accuracy. As 1.003 raised to the power of 4 more accurately equals 1.012015, when rounded to 3 decimal places the result should be 1.012. The step has been intentionally modified to introduce a single wrong calculation.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'calculation_error', and the explanation is:\n\nThe calculation error occurs when the operands and operators of the formula in the first wrong step are exactly correct, and only the result is calculated incorrectly. In this case, the formula 1.003^4 is correct, but the result 1.009 is incorrect. The correct result should be 1.016, which is calculated as 1.003 x 1.003 x 1.003 x 1.003. Therefore, the first wrong step is the last step, and the error is in the result calculation."
