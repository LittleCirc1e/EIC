The question requires that the volume of the cube to be solved be equal to the side cubed, rather than the side squared, which is equivalent to the area of a face of the cube, resulting in (2x)^3=8x^3 in the original_solution becoming (2x)^2=4x^2 in the transformed_solution.

It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct.
