The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than twice the sum of the length and width, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle. This results in the formula for the original area in the original_solution (L*W) being replaced with a formula for the original perimeter (2*(L+W)) in the transformed_solution. Subsequently, the increase in perimeter is incorrectly calculated instead of the increase in area, impacting the transformed_answer. Note that the language descriptions for steps 3 and 4 in the original_solution remain unchanged in the transformed_solution, although the formulas used for calculations are incorrect only for step 3, while step 5 correctly calculates the percentage based on the modified step 4.
