        "question": "the area of a side of a box is 120 sq cm. the area of the other side of the box is 72 sq cm. if the area of the upper surface of the box is 60 sq cm then find the volume of the box.",
        "original_solution": "Let the length, width, and height of the box be l, w, and h respectively.\nGiven, lw = 120, lh = 72, and wh = 60\nSo, l = 120/w, h = 72/l, and w = 60/h\nSubstituting the values of l and h into the equation for w, we get w = 60/(72/(120/w))\nSolving for w, we get w = 10\nNow that we have the value of w, we can find the value of l and h.\nl = 120/10 = 12, h = 72/12 = 6\nSo, the volume of the box is lwh = 12 * 10 * 6 = 720 cubic cm\n#### 720",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the relationship between the areas of the sides of the box. Instead of using the correct relationships of lw = 120, lh = 72, and wh = 60 to solve for the dimensions, it incorrectly changes one relationship, stating that h = 60/w instead of using w = 60/h. This change affects the subsequent calculations resulting in an incorrect value for the height of the box (using h = 60/w instead of w = 60/h), which in turn affects the computation of the box's volume. The correct relationships between the sides are not maintained, introducing the error in the transformed_solution at step 5. This changes the volume calculation from lwh = 12 * 10 * 6 = 720 cubic cm to an incorrect lwh = 12 * 10 * 10 = 1200 cubic cm. The modified step erroneously computes the volume with the wrong dimension for 'w', leading to a transformed_answer that differs from the original_answer.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #3, 'missing_step'. The first wrong step is missing the step of finding the value of h before finding the value of w. The correct order of steps should be: l = 120/w, h"
