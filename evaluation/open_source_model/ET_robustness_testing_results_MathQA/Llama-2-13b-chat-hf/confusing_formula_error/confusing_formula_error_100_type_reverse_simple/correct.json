        "question": "The ratio between the perimeter and the width of a rectangle is 5 : 1 . if the area of the rectangle is 150 sq . cm , what is the width of the rectangle ?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the width of the rectangle.\nThen the length of the rectangle is 150/x.\nAccording to the given ratio, 2(150/x + x) = 5x.\nSolving this equation, we get x = 10.\n#### 10",
        "original_answer": 10.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let x be the width of the rectangle.\nThen the length of the rectangle is 150+x.\nAccording to the given ratio, 2(150+x + x) = 5x.\nSolving this equation, we do not get a proper value for x as this equation becomes invalid.\n#### -1",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In step 2 of the transformed_solution, the area of the rectangle formula has been confused with the perimeter formula. Instead of calculating the length as 150/x, which is using the correct area formula (area = width * length), the transformed_solution incorrectly uses the sum of length and width (150 + x) which does not correctly calculate the length based on the given area and leads to a meaningless equation when trying to apply the ratio of perimeter to width, 2(150+x + x) = 5x. This mistake affects the equality and the calculation of x, leading to an incorrect transformed_answer. The explanation does not include the thinking process or step-by-step generation but simply describes the specific formula confusion error and its consequence on the outcome.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'confusing_formula_error', and the explanation is: The formula used in the first step is incorrect, as the area of the rectangle is not equal to the sum of the length and width of the rectangle. The correct formula for the area of a rectangle is A = l x w, where l is the length and w is the width. Therefore, the first step should be to correct the formula to A = l x w, and then solve for x."
