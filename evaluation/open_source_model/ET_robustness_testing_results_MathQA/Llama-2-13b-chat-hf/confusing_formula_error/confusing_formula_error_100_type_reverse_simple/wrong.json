        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the relationship between the areas of the sides of the box. Instead of using the correct relationships of lw = 120, lh = 72, and wh = 60 to solve for the dimensions, it incorrectly changes one relationship, stating that h = 60/w instead of using w = 60/h. This change affects the subsequent calculations resulting in an incorrect value for the height of the box (using h = 60/w instead of w = 60/h), which in turn affects the computation of the box's volume. The correct relationships between the sides are not maintained, introducing the error in the transformed_solution at step 5. This changes the volume calculation from lwh = 12 * 10 * 6 = 720 cubic cm to an incorrect lwh = 12 * 10 * 10 = 1200 cubic cm. The modified step erroneously computes the volume with the wrong dimension for 'w', leading to a transformed_answer that differs from the original_answer.",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the area of a trapezium with a formula that would calculate the volume of a rectangular prism. The question requires that the area of the trapezium to be solved be equal to half the sum of the parallel sides' lengths multiplied by the distance between them, rather than the product of the lengths of the parallel sides multiplied by the height, which is not a valid formula for the area of trapezium or any geometric figure in this context. This invalid implementation changes the actual correct formula used in the original_solution from A = 1/2 * (a + b) * h becoming A = (a * b) * h in the transformed_solution. The subsequent step 2 using this incorrect formula is also affected, resulting in 192 * 14 = 2688 square cm. Note that the language description of step 1 in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. The changed formula only affects the calculations, not the descriptive language, and this intentionally introduced error propagates through to the final step, leading to a transformed answer that differs from the original answer.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #3, 'referencing_previous_step_value_error', because the formula for the area of a trapezium is A = (a * b) * h, where a and b are the lengths of the parallel sides and h is the distance between them, but the solution uses the formula for the area of a rectangle, A = l * w, where l and w are the length and width of the rectangle, which may cause an error in the operand of the formula in the first wrong step."
