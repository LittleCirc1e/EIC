        "original_solution": "If q is 100, p is 140 because 100 + (40% * 100) = 100 + 40 = 140\nIf p can complete the work in 24 days, q can complete the work in 24 x (140/100) = 33.6 days\nWorking together, they can complete the work in 1 / (1/24 + 1/33.6) = 1 / (0.04166667 + 0.0297619) = 1 / 0.07142857 = 14 days\n#### 14",
        "original_answer": 14.0,
        "transformed_solution": "If q is 100, p is 140 because 100 - (40% * 100) = 100 - 40 = 60\nIf p can complete the work in 24 days, q can complete the work in 24 x (60/100) = 14.4 days\nWorking together, they can complete the work in 1 / (1/24 + 1/14.4) = 1 / (0.04166667 + 0.06944444) = 1 / 0.11111111 = 9 days\n#### 9",

        "explanation": "The original solution's step 1 had an addition operation to calculate p's efficiency as 140%. This was transformed by changing addition to subtraction, incorrectly asserting p's efficiency at 60% instead. Consequently, q would be calculated to finish the work in 14.4 days instead of 33.6 days. Subsequent steps affected by this error calculate the days taken for p and q to complete the work together, turning 14 days into 9 days. Each of these steps uses the incorrect efficiency but correctly follows the operational method. Therefore, only the operator in step 1 was altered, but all the calculations are done correctly based on the modified operator.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is correct. The explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 mistakenly calculates the efficiency of p as 140 instead of 140 - 40 = 100, which only results in an error in one operand in the formula, therefore it belongs to calculation_error."
