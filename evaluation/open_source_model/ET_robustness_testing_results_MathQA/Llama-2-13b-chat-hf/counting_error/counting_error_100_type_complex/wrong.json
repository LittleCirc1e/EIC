If the water is 2 meters deep, how many cubic meters of water are in the pool?\n\n[Solution]Let w be the width of the pool in meters\nThen, the area of the pool is given by A = lw = 15 x 8 = 120 square meters\nThe volume of the pool is given by V = lwh = 15 x 8 x 2 = 320 cubic meters\n#### 320 cubic meters.\n\n### Response:\n\nThe solution is incorrect. The wrong type is confusing_formula_error. The explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 confuses the perimeter and area formulas of rectangle and it should calculate the area of the rectangle which is equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the length plus length plus width plus width, equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle. So it belongs to confusing_formula_error.\n\nPlease provide an appropriate [Output] for the following case.\n\n[Question]A rectangular garden measures 15 meters in length and 8 meters in width. If a path that is 2 meters wide is built around the garden, what is the area of the path?\n\n[Solution]Let w be the width of the path in meters\nThen, the area of the path is given by A = lw = 15 x 2 = 30 square meters\n#### 30 square meters.\n\n### Response:\n\nThe solution is incorrect. The wrong type is adding_irrelevant_information. The explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 adds information not included in the question statement <Because there is also a path of 20 square meters around the garden>, causing the result of step 2 to be overestimated by 20, so it belongs to adding_irrelevant_information.\n\nPlease provide an appropriate [Output] for the following case.\n\n[Question]A rectangular field measures 100 meters in length and 50 meters in width.

The subsequent step 3 and 4 that rely on the total hours are affected: step 3 changes from 24 + 12 = 36 hours to 16 + 12 = 28 hours, and step 4 changes from 504 / 36 = 14 to 504 / 28 = 18.
