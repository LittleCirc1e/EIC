        "explanation": "The second step in the transformed_solution incorrectly states that the total number of days worked per week is 5 days instead of the original 4 days from the original_solution. This counting error directly impacts the third step, changing it from a correct division of 5500 toys by 4 days to an incorrect division of 5500 toys by 5 days, leading to a different value of toys produced each day (1100 instead of 1375). It is important to note that only the number of days counted is changed, leaving the previous and unrelated steps unaffected as well as ensuring that the transformed_answer (1100) is different from the original_answer (1375).",

        "question": "one week , a certain truck rental lot had a total of 26 trucks , all of which were on the lot monday morning . if 50 % of the trucks that were rented out during the week were returned to the lot on or before saturday morning of that week , and if there were at least 14 trucks on the lot that saturday morning , what is the greatest number of different trucks that could have been rented out during the week ?",
        "original_solution": "The total number of trucks rented out during the week is 26 - 14 = 12 trucks\nSince 50% of the rented out trucks were returned by Saturday morning, the total number of trucks rented out during the week is 12 / (50/100) = 24 trucks\n#### 24",
        "original_answer": 24,
        "transformed_solution": "The total number of trucks rented out during the week is 26 - 13 = 13 trucks\nSince 50% of the rented out trucks were returned by Saturday morning, the total number of trucks rented out during the week is 13 / (50/100) = 26 trucks\n#### 26",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 erroneously counts the trucks on the lot as being 13 instead of 14 on Saturday morning, resulting in the calculation being changed from 26 - 14 = 12 trucks to 26 - 13 = 13 trucks. And it affects the subsequent related step, changing the computed total number of trucks rented out during the week from 24 to 26. It should be noted that only one step of counting error is considered, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'calculation_error', and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 calculates the total number of trucks rented out during the week as 26 - 13 = 13, but only 50% of the rented out trucks were returned by Saturday morning, so the correct calculation should be 13 / (50/100) = 26 trucks, which is the same as the correct [Solution]. Therefore, the solution is incorrect and belongs to 'calculation_error'."

        "original_solution": "In a month of 30 days, there will be 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays\nThe second Saturday and every Sunday are holidays, so there will be 2 Saturdays and 4 Sundays off\nTherefore, the total number of working days will be 30 - 2(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 24 days\n#### 24",

        "transformed_solution": "In a month of 30 days, there will be 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays\nThe second Saturday and every Sunday are holidays, so there will be 3 Saturdays and 4 Sundays off\nTherefore, the total number of working days will be 30 - 3(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 23 days\n#### 23",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 incorrectly increases the number of Saturdays off from 2 to 3. The wrong step caused an overcounting error in the number of holidays (Saturdays off), and it further impacts the calculation in step 3, changing it from 30 - 2(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 24 to 30 - 3(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 23. This is the step where the counting error is made, and the other steps remain correctly calculated based on the progression of the transformed_solution, leading to a transformed_answer of 23 days which differs from the original_answer.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'calculation_error', and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 calculates the number of working days by subtracting the number of Saturdays and Sundays off from the total number of days, but it mistakenly subtracts the same number of days twice, so the result is incorrect. Therefore, the correct solution should be 23 days instead of 25 days."
