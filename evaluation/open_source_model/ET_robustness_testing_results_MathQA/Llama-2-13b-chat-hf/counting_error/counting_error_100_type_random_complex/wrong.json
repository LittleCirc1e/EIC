        "question": "Gary’s gas station serves an average of 16 cars per hour on Saturdays, 10 cars per hour on Sundays, and 9 cars per hour on all other days of the week. If the station is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, how many cars does Gary’s station serve over the course of a typical week?",
        "original_solution": "On Saturdays, the station is open for 16 hours, so it serves 16 * 16 = 256 cars\nOn Sundays, the station is open for 16 hours, so it serves 16 * 10 = 160 cars\nFrom Monday to Friday, the station is open for (16 * 5) = 80 hours, so it serves 80 * 9 = 720 cars\nThe total number of cars served over the course of a typical week is 256 + 160 + 720 = 1136 cars\n#### 1136",
        "original_answer": 1136,
        "transformed_solution": "On Saturdays, the station is open for 16 hours, so it serves 16 * 16 = 256 cars\nOn Sundays, the station is open for 16 hours, so it serves 16 * 10 = 160 cars\nFrom Monday to Friday, the station is open for (15 * 5) = 75 hours, so it serves 75 * 9 = 675 cars\nThe total number of cars served over the course of a typical week is 256 + 160 + 675 = 1091 cars\n#### 1091",

        "explanation": "Here, step 3 erroneously counts the number of hours the station is open from Monday to Friday as 15 hours per day instead of the correct 16 hours. This changes the calculation from (16 * 5) = 80 hours to (15 * 5) = 75 hours, and subsequently, the total number of cars served from Monday to Friday changes from 80 * 9 = 720 cars to 75 * 9 = 675 cars. The final step summing up the total number of cars served during the week is then affected, with the original 256 + 160 + 720 changing to 256 + 160 + 675, resulting in a different total of 1091 cars.

        "original_solution": "The total number of books sold is 75 + 50 + 64 + 78 + 135 = 402 books\nThe number of books not sold is 1300 - 402 = 898 books\nThe percentage of books not sold is (898 / 1300) * 100 = 69%\n#### 69",

This affects the calculation of the total number of books sold, the remainder not sold, and the respective percentage. The change from 135 to 120 has modified the subsequent steps without affecting the unrelated steps, resulting in a transformed answer of approximately 70.231% compared to the original answer of 69%.",
