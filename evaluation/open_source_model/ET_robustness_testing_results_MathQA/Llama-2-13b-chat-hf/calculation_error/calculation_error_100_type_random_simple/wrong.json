        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates (55.55 x 9) as 499.95 instead of 500 in step 6, affecting the calculation in step 7 and the resulting Length of the other train. The steps prior to step 6 are unaffected and are correctly calculated. The error is carried through to step 7, adjusting the calculation from (500 - 230) to (499.95 - 230), resulting in the transformed answer of 269.95 m instead of the original answer of 270 m.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #3, 'unit_conversion_error'. The mistake is in the conversion of the speed of the two trains from km/hr to m/s. The correct conversion is: 120 km/"
