        "original_solution": "Add all the marks: 76+65+82+67+85=375\nDivide the total by the number of subjects: 375/5=75\n#### 75",
        "original_answer": 75.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Add all the marks: 76+65+82+67+85=365\nDivide the total by the number of subjects: 365/5=73\n#### 73",
        "transformed_answer": 73.0,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The sum of the marks in the modified first step was incorrectly calculated as 365 instead of 375. As a result, all subsequent calculations are based on this incorrect total. The division in step 2 is correctly performed using the new, incorrect total, yielding an average of 73 instead of 75.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'calculation_error', and the explanation is:\n\nThe correct calculation is 76+65+82+67+85=365\nDivide the total by the number of subjects: 365/5=76\n#### 76, not 73.\n\nThe solution has a calculation error, specifically, the final answer of 73 is incorrect and should be 76."

        "question": "John bought 9.25 m of cloth for $ 434.75. Find the cost price per metre.",
        "original_solution": "The cost price per meter is 434.75 / 9.25 = 47 \n#### 47",
        "original_answer": 47.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The cost price per meter is 434.75 / 9.25 = 45 \n#### 45",

        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The error was introduced in step 1 by incorrectly calculating the cost per meter as $45 instead of $47. The initial operation 434.75 / 9.25 was not changed, only the final result was altered, and therefore there is a single calculation error in this step. As this question contains only one step, the mistake only impacts the result of this step, leading to an incorrect transformed_answer of $45 instead of the correct $47.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'calculation_error', and the explanation is:\n\nIn the first step, the formula used is correct, but the calculation is incorrect. The correct calculation is 434.75 / 9.25 = 47.36, not 45. Therefore, the final answer should be 47.36 instead of 45."
