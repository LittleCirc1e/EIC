If the water is 3 meters deep, how many cubic meters of water are in the pool?\n\n[Solution]Let the area of the pool be A = 15*8 = 120 square meters\nThe volume of water is 3*120 = 360 cubic meters\n#### 360.\n\n### Response:\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is confusing_formula_error, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 confuses the formula of the area of rectangle and it should calculate the area of the rectangle which is equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the length plus length plus width plus width, equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle. So it belongs to confusing_formula_error.\n\nPlease provide an appropriate [Output] for the following case.\n\n[Question]A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 books. If the bookshelf is currently empty, how many books can be placed on it in total?\n\n[Solution]Let the number of books be x\nx = 5*8 = 40\n#### 40.\n\n### Response:\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is adding_irrelevant_information, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2.
