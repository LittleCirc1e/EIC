        "question": "Circular gears p and q start rotating at the same time at constant speeds. Gear p makes 10 revolutions per minute and gear q makes 40 revolutions per minute. How many seconds after the gears start rotating will gear q have made exactly 5 more revolutions than gear p?",
        "original_solution": "Let t be the time in minutes after the gears start rotating.\nAfter t minutes, gear p will have made 10t revolutions and gear q will have made 40t revolutions.\nWe need to find t such that 40t = 10t + 5\nSolving for t: 30t = 5, t = 5/30 = 1/6\nIn seconds, 1/6 minutes is 1/6 * 60 = 10 seconds.\n#### 10",
        "original_answer": 10.0,

        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 4 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 minute is wrongly equal to 50 seconds instead of 60 seconds, resulting in 1/6 * 60 = 10 seconds in the original_solution becoming 1/6 * 50 = 8.33 seconds in the transformed_solution. The error only affects the unit conversion for representing minutes into seconds and does not affect the algebraic operation or the process to find t, as that remains correct.",
