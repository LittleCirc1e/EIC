        "original_solution": "Total hours worked in a week = (8 * 3) + (6 * 2) = 24 + 12 = 36 hours\nShe earns $468 per week\nEarning per hour = 468 / 36\n#### 13",
        "original_answer": 13.0,

        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 erroneously counts Monday, Wednesday, and Friday as 2 days each instead of 3, reducing the total worked hours from (8 * 3) to (8 * 2). This counting error affects only the calculation related to the total hours worked (step 1) and subsequently changes the earning per hour computation (step 3) from 468 / 36 = 13 to 468 / 28 = 16.7142857143. It should be noted that the counting error should only be at one place, and the other calculation processes after the count alteration stay correct.",
        "eval_result": "The solution is incorrect, the wrong type is missing_step, and the explanation is Sheila works 8 hours per day on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and 6 hours per day on Tuesday and Thursday. She does not work on Saturday and Sunday. The missing step is to determine the total number of hours she works in a week. The total number of hours worked in a week is 16 + 12 = 28 hours. She earns $468 per week. To find her earning per hour, we divide her total earnings by the total number of hours worked: $468 / 28 = $17.142857143.\nTherefore, the value of the unknown variable x is $17.142857143.The answer is: "
