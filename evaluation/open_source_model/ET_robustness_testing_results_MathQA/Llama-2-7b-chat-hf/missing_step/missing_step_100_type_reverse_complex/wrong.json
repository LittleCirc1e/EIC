Since step 1 is removed, the transformed_solution directly divides the total length of the yard by the number of trees, instead of the number of gaps. Thus, it incorrectly references 32 instead of 31 for calculating the length of each gap. This is an incorrect calculation because the number of gaps between the trees (which is 31 gaps) should be used, not the total number of trees.
