By deleting the step that calculates and converts speed, the transformed_solution computes time directly using the given Distance in the question and the calculation of relative speed from the original data in the question, which avoids converting it separately to m/s. This results in the formula 440/((60+6)*(5/18)). However, the transformation adds the wrong coefficients for the final calculation, using (3/66) instead of (3/55), resulting in an incorrect transformed_answer of 20 seconds.

We now directly connect the logical structure with the remaining steps, stating that n must be greater than the result from step 1 and less than the result from step 4, without explicitly solving for these values, which leads to n > 3 and n < 7. The omission of step 2 causes the transformed_answer to change its presentation format, but not its mathematical meaning.

Thus, since step 3 in the original_solution uses the results from both steps 1 and 2, it will now incorrectly reference the number 36 from the question twice, instead of using the value of 24 from the deleted step 1. The formula changes from 24 + 36 + 45 = 105 to 36 + 36 + 45 = 117.
