        "explanation": "In this example, the first step has been omitted, and its calculations wrongly incorporated into a single transformed step. The increase in speed after two intervals (which should be 2 + 5 * 2 = 12 miles per hour) is correctly calculated, but the multiplication by the fraction representing 5 minutes in an hour (5/60) is incorrectly done. Due to this, the distance traveled in the third interval equation changes to (2 + 5 * 2) * (5 / 60) in the transformed_solution. Since the omission has led to a calculation error in the combined single step, the wrong_step is 1. The transformed answer of 2 miles is incorrect as the actual distance traveled in the third 5-minute interval should be 1 mile.",

Step 3 does not convert the time the car spent in the first interval from hours to minutes, but directly adds up the distance traveled in each interval without converting the time, which only results in an error in one operand in the formula, thus it belongs to missing_step.\n\nPlease provide an appropriate [Output] for the following case."

        "explanation": "In the original_solution, step 2 is an equation involving -2a and a quantity of b. The subsequent steps calculate expressions involving 2a and 22b. We remove the third step, which involves a simple reiteration of the equation from step 2. Because the deleted step is just an exact repetition and doesn't involve any calculation with new values, we need to update the formula in the next step to reflect an actual step of combining the two equations. The correct transformation to combine them would be to add the equations together before isolating terms. So we transform step 2 from -2a - 12b = 10b + 80 to (9a - b) - (-2a + 12b) = 10b + 80, and then simplify it to get 7a + 11b = 80. The subsequent step then multiplies the b term by 2 to match the term 22b in the question. The result now becomes 2a + 22b = 160/7 or approximately 22.8571428571.",
