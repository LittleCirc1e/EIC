Hence, the transformed_solution proceeds directly with converting 8% to a fraction as 8/100. However, instead of simplifying this fraction to 2/25, an intentional error is introduced in the simplification process that results in an incorrect fraction of 4/50. Since the transformation starts from the middle of the original solution (skipping the explanation about dividing by 100), the wrong_step is 1. Note that the fraction 4/50 is equivalent to 2/25, so to ensure the transformed_answer is different, we will choose 4/50.",

However, this formula wrongly assumes that 29 is the total weight in ounces, not the weight in pounds, hence resulting in an error. There is a misunderstanding of the unit conversion, and the division by the number of containers is missing. The wrong_step is 1 because it is the first step that references the incorrect number after the transformation, considering the removal of the first step resulting in a direct calculation based on the initial weight in pounds instead of converting it to ounces first.",
