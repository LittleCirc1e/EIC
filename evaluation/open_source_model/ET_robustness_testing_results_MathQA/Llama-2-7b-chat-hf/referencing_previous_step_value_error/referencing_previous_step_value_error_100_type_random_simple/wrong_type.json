        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references the number 15 as 13 and incorrectly changes 3x = 2x + 8 + 7 to 3x = 2x + 13. It should be noted that step 3 in the transformed_solution <3x = 2x + 8 + 7> should be the same as step 3 in the original_solution <3x = 2x + 8 + 7> and calculates its result correctly. Step 4 affects the subsequent steps 5 and 6 related to it. Step 5 incorrectly determines x as 13 (instead of the correct 15), and step 6 incorrectly calculates the third number as 17 (instead of the correct 19). The remaining calculations for steps 5 and 6 are correct based on the erroneous value obtained in step 4. Since only one error needs to be considered, all other steps that reference this result number still reference this number correctly.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'missing_step'. The reasoning process is correct, but the step that the third number is equal to x + 4 is missing. Therefore, the final answer is incorrect."
