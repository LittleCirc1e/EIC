        "original_solution": "The speed in the third interval is 2 + (5 * 2) = 12 miles per hour\nThe distance traveled in the third interval is 12 * (5 / 60) = 1 mile\n#### 1",

The incorrect division leads to a halved answer even though the previous step calculated the interval speed correctly. All other steps that should reference the correct result of the third interval speed, continue to reference the figure correctly.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'calculation_error'. The explanation is that the formula used to calculate the distance traveled in the third interval is incorrect. The correct formula is: distance = speed * time, where time is the duration of the interval in hours. In this case, the time in the third interval is 5 minutes, which is equal to 0.083 hours. Therefore, the distance traveled in the third interval is: distance = 2 + (5 * 2) = 12 miles per hour x 0.083 hours = 0.994 miles."
