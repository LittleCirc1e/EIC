The error occurs in the division step in transformed_solution where the speed of the car in step 2, 55 km/h, is accurately calculated.

George's age is then C + 8.\nFord's age is C - 2.\nWe form the equation C + (C + 8) + (C - 2) = 60 to represent the sum of their ages.\nCombining like terms, we get 3C + 6 = 60.\nSubtracting 6 from both sides, we get 3C = 54.\nDividing by 3, we get C = 18.\nSo, Ford's age is 18 - 2 = 16.\n#### 16",

All other steps that reference this result number still reference this number correctly. The subsequent steps related to step 8 will be affected by the erroneous result of this step but still be calculated correctly, based on the mistake carried forward.
