        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'calculation_error'. The explanation is that the formula used to calculate the distance traveled in the third interval is incorrect. The correct formula is: distance = speed * time, where time is the duration of the interval in hours. In this case, the time in the third interval is 5 minutes, which is equal to 0.0833 hours. Therefore, the distance traveled in the third interval is: distance = 2 + (5 * 2) = 12 miles per hour x 0.0833 hours = 0.99 miles."
