        "explanation": "In this case, the transformed_solution contains a miscalculation in step 4, where the multiplication of 2 by the first equation is incorrectly carried out as 4a + 2b = 22 instead of 4a + 2b = 20. This single error affects all subsequent steps that rely on it. As a result, step 5 becomes 3a = 14 rather than 3a = 12, and consequently in step 6, the value of a is incorrectly calculated using the wrong 3a value, giving a = 14 / 3 instead of 4. This error flows through to step 7, 8 and 9, where the value of b and the total number of people are calculated based on this incorrect number of associate professors a. Thus, the entire transformed solution carries the initial miscalculation through all related steps, resulting in a wrong answer of approximately 5.33 people instead of the correct answer of 6 people.",
