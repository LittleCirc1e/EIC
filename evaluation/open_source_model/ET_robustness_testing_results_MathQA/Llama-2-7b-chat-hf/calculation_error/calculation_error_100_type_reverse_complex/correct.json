If a 20% discount is offered on the bicycle, what is the new price of the bicycle?\n\n[Solution]Let the new price of the bicycle be x dollars.\nThe discount = 20% = 0.20\nThe discount amount = 0.20 x $250 = $50\nThe new price = $250 - $50 = $200\nThe new price of the bicycle is $200.\n\n### Response:\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is calculation_error, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 4. Step 4 correctly calculates the discount amount, but only uses one operator in the formula to calculate the new price, which is incorrect, so it belongs to calculation_error.\n\nPlease provide an appropriate [Output] for the following case.\n[Question]A book costs $25.
