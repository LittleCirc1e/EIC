The first wrong step confuses the perimeter and area formulas of rectangle and it should calculate the area of the rectangle which is equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the length plus length plus width plus width, equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle. So it belongs to confusing_formula_error.\n\nPlease provide an appropriate [Output] for the following case.\n[Question]A rectangular swimming pool is 12 m long and 8 m wide.

The first wrong step performs an incorrect unit conversion and mistakenly assumes that one meter is equal to 50 centimeters instead of 100 centimeters, which only results in an error in one operand in the formula, therefore it belongs to unit_conversion_error."
