        "question": "Maxwell leaves his home and walks toward Brad's house at the same time that Brad leaves his home and runs toward Maxwell's house. If the distance between their homes is 36 kilometers, Maxwell's walking speed is 3 km/h, and Brad's running speed is 6 km/h. What is the distance traveled by Maxwell when they meet in the middle?",
        "original_solution": "Let the time they meet be t hours.\nBrad's distance = 6t\nMaxwell's distance = 3t\nTotal distance = 36\n6t + 3t = 36\n9t = 36\nt = 4\nMaxwell's distance = 3 x 4 = 12\n#### 12",
        "original_answer": 12.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let the time they meet be t hours.\nBrad's distance = 6t\nMaxwell's distance = 3t\nTotal distance = 36\n6t - 3t = 36\n3t = 36\nt = 12\nMaxwell's distance = 3 x 12 = 36\n#### 36",

        "wrong_step": 4,
        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this example, the addition in the original equation 6t + 3t = 36 was changed to subtraction, making it 6t - 3t = 36. The subtraction led to a new equation, 3t = 36, with t being incorrectly calculated to satisfy the incorrect equation. This results in a wrong time of t=12, which affects the subsequent calculation of Maxwell's distance. The correct calculation of step 5 becomes 3t = 36, giving t = 12, and step 6 then multiplies Maxwell’s speed by this incorrect time to get a final incorrect result of 36 kilometers. All other steps have been correctly calculated based on the modified values.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'missing_step'. The explanation is that the reasoning process is incomplete, and the distance traveled by Maxwell when they meet in the middle is not calculated. To complete the reasoning process, the distance traveled by Maxwell can be calculated by multiplying his walking speed by the time taken to meet Brad in the middle."

        "question": "In a mixed college 160 students are there in one class. Out of these 160 students, 1/2 are girls. How many boys are there?",
        "original_solution": "There are 160 x 1/2 = 80 girls in the class.\nThere are 160 - 80 = 80 boys in the class.\n#### 80",
        "original_answer": 80.0,
        "transformed_solution": "There are 160 / 1/2 = 320 girls in the class.\nThere are 160 - 320 = -160 boys in the class.\n#### -160",
        "transformed_answer": -160.0,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this example, the multiplication operator in step 1 has been changed to division, thus incorrectly calculating the number of girls as 160 / 1/2 = 320 instead of 160 x 1/2 = 80. This results in an impossible count of boys, calculated in step 2 as 160 - 320 = -160, which is not a feasible number of students. The original count was 80 boys, so the transformation caused by the operator error in step 1 led to a nonsensical answer. Every step's calculation is correct except for the incorrect application of the operator in step 1.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'missing_step'. The explanation is that the solution does not include a necessary reasoning step, which is to divide the total number of students by 2 to determine the number of boys. Therefore, the solution should be: The solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'missing_step', and the explanation is that the solution does not include a necessary reasoning step."

        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The example changes the subtraction in step 1 to addition, converting 1/3 - 1/8 to 1/3 + 1/8 and therefore changing the result from 5/24 to 11/24. This affects step 2, where the time taken to fill the cistern changes from 24/5 = 4.8 hours to 24/11 = 2.1818 hours. The calculation in step 1 is done correctly but with the wrong operator, leading to an incorrect result, and this error carries over to step 2. However, step 2 calculations are performed correctly using the incorrect result from step 1.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'calculation_error'. The explanation is that the combined rate of both taps is not 1/3 + 1/8 = 11/24 cistern/hour, but it is actually 1/3 + 1/8 = 7/24 cistern/hour, and the time it takes to fill the cistern is 24/7 = 3.5714 hours, not 2.1818 hours."
