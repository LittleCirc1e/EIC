This impacts the profit per item calculation and the total number of items needed to be sold to reach the target profit, changing the original step from a division of $280,000 by $5 to a division by $3 due to the altered profit per item. The result changes the required number of items from 56,000 in the original_solution to 93,334 in the transformed_solution.
