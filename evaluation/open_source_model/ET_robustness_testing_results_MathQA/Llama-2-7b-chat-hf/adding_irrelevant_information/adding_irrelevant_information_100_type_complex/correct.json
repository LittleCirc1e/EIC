The bird flies at the rate of 20 km/h and the bat at the rate of 60 km/h. How far will the bird be ahead of the bat after 2 hours?\n\n[Solution]Let the distance covered by the bird be x km and the distance covered by the bat be y km in 2 hours. Since they start at the same time and fly in the same direction, their relative position does not change, so x + y = 20 + 60 = 80 km after 2 hours. Therefore, x = 20, y = 60.#### 80.\n\n### Response:\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is missing_step, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 3. Step 3 does not take into account the fact that the bird and the bat start at the same time, so it assumes that the bird is ahead of the bat from the start, which is not the case, therefore it belongs to missing_step.\n\nPlease provide an appropriate [Output] for the following case.\n\n[Question]A car travels from point A to point B at a speed of 40 km/h and returns to point A at a speed of 60 km/h.
