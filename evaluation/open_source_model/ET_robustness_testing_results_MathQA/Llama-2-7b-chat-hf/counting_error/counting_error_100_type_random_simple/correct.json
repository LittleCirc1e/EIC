        "question": "gary’s gas station serves an average of 14 cars per hour on Saturdays, 10 cars per hour on Sundays, and 9 cars per hour on all other days of the week. if the station is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, how many cars does gary’s station serve over the course of a typical week?",
        "original_solution": "On Saturdays, the station serves cars for 16 hours (10 pm - 6 am + 1). So the total number of cars served on Saturdays is 14 cars/hour * 16 hours = 224 cars\nOn Sundays, the station serves cars for 16 hours. So the total number of cars served on Sundays is 10 cars/hour * 16 hours = 160 cars\nFrom Monday to Friday, the station serves cars for 16 hours/day * 5 days = 80 hours. So the total number of cars served from Monday to Friday is 9 cars/hour * 80 hours = 720 cars\nThe total number of cars served over a typical week is 224 + 160 + 720 = 1104 cars\n#### 1104",
        "original_answer": 1104,
        "transformed_solution": "On Saturdays, the station serves cars for 16 hours (10 pm - 6 am + 1). So the total number of cars served on Saturdays is 14 cars/hour * 16 hours = 224 cars\nOn Sundays, the station serves cars for 16 hours. So the total number of cars served on Sundays is 10 cars/hour * 16 hours = 160 cars\nFrom Monday to Friday, the station serves cars for 16 hours/day * 5 days = 80 hours. But a counting mistake makes it 16 hours/day * 4 days = 64 hours. So the total number of cars served from Monday to Friday due to the incorrect count is 9 cars/hour * 64 hours = 576 cars\nThe total number of cars served over a typical week with the mistaken count is 224 + 160 + 576 = 960 cars\n#### 960",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 3 incorrectly counts the weekdays as 4 days instead of 5, changing the multiplication from 16 hours/day * 5 days to 16 hours/day * 4 days. This leads to the total hours served from Monday to Friday being 64 instead of 80, and the total number of cars served from Monday to Friday is calculated incorrectly as 9 cars/hour * 64 hours = 576 cars. This changes the overall total in step 4 from 224 + 160 + 720 = 1104 to 224 + 160 + 576 = 960. The counting error only affects the step it is introduced in and any subsequent steps that depend on the miscalculation.",

        "original_solution": "The total number of books sold is 50 + 82 + 60 + 48 + 40 = 280 books\nThe number of books not sold is 620 - 280 = 340 books\nThe percentage of books not sold is (340 / 620) * 100 = 54.84%\n#### 54.84%",

        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, there was a counting error introduced in the calculation of the percentage. The division by the number of days (which was 5 in reality but mistakenly counted as 4) is not relevant for the calculation of the percentage of books not sold. The incorrect transformation changed the calculation from a correct percentage to an incorrect value by dividing the percentage of books not sold by 4, which is unrelated to the number of days books were sold.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'counting_error'. The explanation is that the number of days in the question is 5, but the solution assumes it is 4, which affects the calculation of the percentage of books not sold."
