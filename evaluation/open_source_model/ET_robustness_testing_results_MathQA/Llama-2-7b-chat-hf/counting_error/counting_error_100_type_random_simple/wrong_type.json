        "question": "How to resolve this question: second saturday and every sunday is a holiday. How many working days will be there in a month of 30 days beginning on a Saturday?",
        "original_solution": "In a month of 30 days, there will be 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays\nThe second Saturday and every Sunday are holidays, so there will be 2 Saturdays and 4 Sundays off\nTherefore, the total number of working days will be 30 - 2(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 24 days\n#### 24",
        "original_answer": 24,
        "transformed_solution": "In a month of 30 days, there will be 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays\nThe second Saturday and every Sunday are holidays, so there will be 3 Saturdays and 4 Sundays off\nTherefore, the total number of working days will be 30 - 3(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 23 days\n#### 23",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 incorrectly increases the number of Saturdays off from 2 to 3. The wrong step caused an overcounting error in the number of holidays (Saturdays off), and it further impacts the calculation in step 3, changing it from 30 - 2(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 24 to 30 - 3(Saturdays) - 4(Sundays) = 23. This is the step where the counting error is made, and the other steps remain correctly calculated based on the progression of the transformed_solution, leading to a transformed_answer of 23 days which differs from the original_answer.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'missing_step'. The explanation is that the solution does not include a necessary reasoning step, which is the number of working days in a month of 30 days beginning on a Saturday. The solution only provides the number of holidays in a month of 30 days, which is not enough to determine the total number of working days. To find the total number of working days, we need to subtract the number of holidays from the total number of days in the month."

        "original_solution": "Let x be the number of miles bill ran on Saturday\nOn Sunday, Bill ran x + 4 miles\nJulia ran 2*(x+4) = 2x + 8 miles on Sunday\nThe total number of miles ran on Saturday and Sunday is x + (x+4) + (2x+8) = 20\nCombining like terms, 4x + 12 = 20\nSubtracting 12 from both sides gives 4x = 8\nDividing both sides by 4 gives x = 2\nSo, Bill ran x + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6 miles on Sunday\n#### 6",

        "original_solution": "The total number of books sold is 75 + 50 + 64 + 78 + 135 = 402 books\nThe number of books not sold is 1300 - 402 = 898 books\nThe percentage of books not sold is (898 / 1300) * 100 = 69%\n#### 69",

        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'calculation_error'. The explanation is that the calculation of the total number of books sold is incorrect, as the sum of the number of books sold on each day is not equal to the total number of books in the stock. For example, the total number of books sold on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday is 75 + 50 + 64 + 78 + 120 = 387 books, which is different from the total number of books in the stock, which is 1300 books.
