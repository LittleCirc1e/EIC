Solving for s, we get s = d/sqrt(2).\nThe area of the first square is s^2 = d^2/2.\nThe area of the second square is d^2.\nThe ratio of the area of the bigger square to that of the smaller square is (d^2)/(d^2/2) = 2.\n#### 2",

        "explanation": "Here, step 4 confuses the formula for the area of a square with the formula for the perimeter of a square. The correct approach is to square the length of the side to find the area, however, in the transformed_solution, the length of the side is multiplied by 4, which calculates the perimeter, not the area. As a result, the original ratio (d^2)/(d^2/2) = 2 is mistakenly transformed to (4d)/(d^2/2) = 8/d, which significantly alters the ratio. The language description stating \"The ratio of the area of the bigger square\" remains unchanged despite the fact that we performed calculations for the perimeter instead. Since only one step of confusing formula error is allowed, only step 4 has been altered, while the other steps remain correct.",

This was mistakenly transformed to the remaining perimeter of the field, represented by the sum of the lengths of the boundaries, 10+10+10+10-5-5=25 meters in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 3, changing from 75/75=1 meter to 75/25=3 meters.

In this case, the base is 6 units long (the difference in the x-coordinates of the points on the same horizontal level), and the height is 2 units long (the difference in the y-coordinates of the points on the same vertical level).
