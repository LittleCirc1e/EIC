        "explanation": "Here, step 5 confuses the concentration calculation by using an incorrect ratio. The question requires that the percent composition be calculated using the total volume of the solution (540 gallons of sodium chloride plus the remaining water). Instead of dividing by the total volume (6,000 gallons), it divides just by the water content (5,460 gallons), switching from a concentration calculation to an incorrect ratio, resulting in 540 / 6,000 * 100 = 9% in the original_solution being changed to 540 / 5,460 * 100 = 9.89% in the transformed_solution.

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the area and perimeter of rectangle. The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width, and the perimeter be twice the sum of the length and width. The change in the transformed_solution is the swap of the formulas for area and perimeter, resulting in 'Area = L * W = 300' becoming 'Perimeter = L + L + W + W = 300' and 'Perimeter = 2L + 2W = 70' becoming 'Area = 2L + 2W', with the rest of the steps incorrectly based on this swapped premise. This results in an incorrect transformed_answer of 50 meters for the width, instead of the correct answer of 15 meters.
