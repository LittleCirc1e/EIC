The perimeter represents the total length around the cube when unfolded into a cross shape made of six squares, which is not the correct calculation for the surface area. Thus, in the original_solution, step 4, which correctly applies the surface area formula (6*12^2 = 6*144 = 864), is transformed to use the perimeter formula instead, resulting in the calculation 12*12 = 144 in the transformed_solution.

The question requires that the volume of the cube to be solved be equal to the side cubed, rather than the side squared, which is equivalent to the area of a face of the cube, resulting in (2x)^3=8x^3 in the original_solution becoming (2x)^2=4x^2 in the transformed_solution. This affects the ratio calculated in the last step, changing from 8x^3 : 27x^3 to 4x^2 : 27x^3. Note that the language description of step 2 < The volume of the first cube is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct.

The transformed solution incorrectly attempts to find a 'perimeter' by naively adding the two given sides with an assumed third side, which is improperly taken as half of one of the sides assuming a right triangle, which is not given in the problem. This confuses the concept of area with perimeter and also brings in an unrelated concept of a right triangle within an obtuse triangle. Note that the language description of step 1 < First, use the formula to find the area > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution.
