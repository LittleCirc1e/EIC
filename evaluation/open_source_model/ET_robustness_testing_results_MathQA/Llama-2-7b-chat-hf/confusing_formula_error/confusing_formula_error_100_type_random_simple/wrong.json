        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #1. The formula for the volume of a cone is indeed V = (1/3)πr^2h, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height. To find the radius of the base, we need to use the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is C = 2πr, and rearranging, we get r = C/(2π). Plugging in the values, we get r = 30/(2π) = 30 cm, and then plugging this value into the formula for the volume of a cone, we get V = (1/3)π(30)^2(6) = 45 cm^3, which is the correct answer."
