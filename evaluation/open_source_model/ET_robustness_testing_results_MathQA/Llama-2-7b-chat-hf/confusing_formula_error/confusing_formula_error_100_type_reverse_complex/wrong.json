        "explanation": "Here, step 2 made a mistake in the multiplication process of the fraction. Instead of using the reciprocal of 4/5, which is 5/4, the transformed solution incorrectly multiplies 3/5 by the original fraction of 4/5, resulting in (3/5) * (4/5) = 12/25. As a result, this step does not calculate the correct division representation of the ratio. The explanation of step 2 in the language remains unchanged, although the mathematical operation is incorrect. The error results in a different transformed answer of 12/25 instead of the correct 3/4 from the original solution.",

        "explanation": "Here, step 3 in the original solution makes a mistake by confusing the formula for calculating the area of a square with the perimeter formula. The perimeter of a square is given by 4 times the side length, while the area is given by the side squared. Thus, in the transformed solution, the calculation of the actual area of the square is mistakenly changed from x^2 to 4*x, the formula for the perimeter. This in turn affects step 4, changing the calculation of the area with the error from (1.04x)^2 to simply 4*1.04x, and this will affect the final error percentage calculation in step 5. We have to recalculate the error percentage based on the incorrect area calculation, yielding a transformed answer of 4%. Note that the language description of step 3 in the original solution <The actual area of the square is > remains unchanged in the transformed solution. The other steps related to calculation in the transformed solution are adjusted accordingly to maintain logical coherence after the initial error.",
