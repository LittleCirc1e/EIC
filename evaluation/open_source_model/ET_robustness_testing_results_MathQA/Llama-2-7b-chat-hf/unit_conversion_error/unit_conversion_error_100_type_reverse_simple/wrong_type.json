        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'calculation_error'. The explanation is: The solution is incorrect because it does not take into account the extra time taken by the train to cover the distance, which is 15 minutes. The formula used is Distance = Speed × Time, which is correct, but the value of Time is not calculated correctly. The correct formula to use is Distance = Speed × (Time + extra_time), where extra_time is the time taken by the train to cover the extra distance due to its late arrival. Therefore, the correct answer is T = 9/5 hours."
