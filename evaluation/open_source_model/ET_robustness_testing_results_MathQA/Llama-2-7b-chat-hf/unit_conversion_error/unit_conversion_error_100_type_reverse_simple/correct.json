        "original_solution": "The volume of 400 kilograms of the substance is 1 cubic meter, which is equal to 1,000,000 cubic centimeters.\nSo, the volume of 1 kilogram of the substance is 1,000,000 cubic centimeters / 400 kilograms = 2,500 cubic centimeters per kilogram.\nSince 1 kilogram is equal to 1,000 grams, then the volume of 1 gram of the substance is 2,500 cubic centimeters / 1,000 grams = 2.5 cubic centimeters per gram.\n#### 2.5",

        "original_solution": "First, we need to convert 1 hour and 15 minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 minutes is 15/60 = 0.25 hours.
