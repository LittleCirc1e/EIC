And it affects the subsequent related step 4, which changes from 4320 - 2x = x to 3600 - 2x = x and the solution from x = 4320 to x = 3600 / 3 = 1200 litres for the capacity of the tank. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, so the other calculation processes related to the rate of the leak are still correct.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'calculation_error'. The explanation is that the formula used to solve the problem is incorrect. The formula used is 3600 - 2x = x, which is not the correct formula to solve the problem. The correct formula is 3600 - 2x = 1200, which is the answer to the question."
