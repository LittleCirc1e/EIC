        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #3, which is your explanation about why the [Solution] is correct.\n\nGear r will make exactly 6 more revolutions than gear l in 6 seconds because, in one minute, gear r makes 2400 revolutions, and gear l makes 1200 revolutions, so gear r makes 1200 more revolutions than gear l. Then, in one minute, gear r makes 1200/20 = 60 more revolutions than gear l. Finally, gear r will make exactly 6 more revolutions than gear l in 60/10 = 6 seconds."
