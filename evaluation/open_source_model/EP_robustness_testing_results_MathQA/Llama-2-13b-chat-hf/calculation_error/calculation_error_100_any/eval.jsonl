The explanation is #2, which is that the number of ways to have exactly one head is 8 choose 1, which is 8. This is because when we toss 8 coins, there are 8 possible outcomes for the first coin (heads or tails), and for each of those outcomes, there are 7 possible outcomes for the second coin (heads or tails), and so on. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 2^8 = 256. Of those possible outcomes, there is only one way to have exactly one head, which is to have heads on the first coin and tails on the remaining 7 coins.
