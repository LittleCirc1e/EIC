In this case, the rate of the first tap is 1/3 cistern/hour, and the rate of the second tap is 1/8 cistern/hour.

The correct ratio of milk and water in the tumbler is 9:12, not 9:31.\n\nTo see why, let's analyze the solution:\n\n1. The first glass contains 1/4 milk and 3/4 water, so the total amount of milk and water in the first glass is 3/4 + 1/4 = 1 1/4.\n2. The second glass contains 1/5 milk and 4/5 water, so the total amount of milk and water in the second glass is 4/5 + 1/5 = 1 4/5.\n3. When the contents of the two glasses are mixed in the tumbler, the total amount of milk and water in the tumbler is 1 1/4 + 1 4/5 = 2 5/10.\n4. Therefore, the ratio of milk and water in the tumbler is 25/10, which simplifies to 5:2 or 9:12.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 9:12, not 9:31."
