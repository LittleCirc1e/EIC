If the distance between their homes is 36 kilometers, Maxwell's walking speed is 3 km/h, and Brad's running speed is 6 km/h. What is the distance traveled by Maxwell when they meet in the middle?",
        "transformed_solution": "Let the time they meet be t hours.\nBrad's distance = 6t\nMaxwell's distance = 3t\nTotal distance = 36\n6t + 3t = 36\n9t = 36\nt = 4\nMaxwell's distance = 3 x 4 = 12\n#### 12",
        "label": "yes",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #3, which is that the total distance traveled by both Maxwell and Brad is equal to the distance between their homes. This is because they meet in the middle of the distance between their homes, and the distance traveled by each of them is half of the total distance. Therefore, the distance traveled by Maxwell is 12 kilometers, which is half of the total distance of 36 kilometers."
