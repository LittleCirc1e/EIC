Since the bus travels at a constant speed, the total time taken to travel this distance is equal to the distance divided by the speed, which is 60 km / 60 km/hr = 1 hour.\n\nTherefore, the total time taken to travel the distance without stoppages is 1 hour.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much time the bus spends on stoppages per hour. We are given that the average speed of the bus including stoppages is 20 km/hr, which means that the total distance traveled in one hour with stoppages is 20 km. Since the bus travels at a constant speed, the total time taken to travel this distance is equal to the distance divided by the speed, which is 20 km / 20 km/hr = 1 hour.\n\nTherefore, the total time taken to travel the distance with stoppages is also 1 hour.\n\nSo, the total time taken to travel the distance without stoppages is 1 hour, and the total time taken to travel the distance with stoppages is also 1 hour.
