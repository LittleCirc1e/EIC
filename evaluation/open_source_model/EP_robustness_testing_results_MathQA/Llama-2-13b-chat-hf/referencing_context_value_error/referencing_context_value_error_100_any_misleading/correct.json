Firstly, the student has misunderstood the question and assumed that Aaron will jog and walk at the same speed, which is not the case. Secondly, the student has calculated the time it takes for Aaron to jog and walk separately, but has not combined the times correctly. Finally, the student has made a calculation error in combining like terms.\n\nTo correct the solution, we need to first calculate the time it takes for Aaron to jog from home at 3 miles per hour, which is 3/3 = 1 hour. Then, we need to calculate the time it takes for Aaron to walk back home at 6 miles per hour, which is 6/6 = 1 hour. Since Aaron will spend 1 hour jogging and 1 hour walking, the total time spent is 2 hours. Therefore, the correct answer is 2 hours."
