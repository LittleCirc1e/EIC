The student has listed all the even numbers between 2 and 15, but they have not considered whether these numbers are exactly divisible by 2. To be exactly divisible by 2, a number must be divisible by 2 without a remainder. For example, 2, 4, and 6 are exactly divisible by 2 because 2 x 2 = 4, 4 x 2 = 8, and 6 x 2 = 12, with no remainder. However, 10 and 12 are not exactly divisible by 2 because 10 x 2 = 20 with a remainder of 0, and 12 x 2 = 24 with a remainder of 0. Therefore, the correct answer is 4, not 6."

The student has calculated the total number of cars served over the course of a typical week by simply multiplying the number of cars served per day by the number of days in a week, but this approach is not correct. The correct approach is to first find the total number of hours the station is open in a week, and then calculate the number of cars served per hour and multiply it by the total number of hours.\n\nTo find the total number of hours the station is open in a week, we need to add up the number of hours it is open on each day of the week. There are 7 days in a week, and the station is open for 24 hours on each day except Sunday, when it is open for 16 hours. So, the total number of hours the station is open in a week is:\n\n7 * 24 = 168 hours + 1 * 16 = 16 hours = 184 hours\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of cars served per hour and multiply it by the total number of hours. The number of cars served per hour on Saturdays is 16 cars/hour, on Sundays it is 10 cars/hour, and on other days it is 9 cars/hour. So, the total number of cars served over the course of a typical week is:\n\n16 * 184 = 2924 cars + 10 * 184 = 1840 cars + 9 * 184 = 1666 cars = 6430 cars\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 6430 cars."
