The first step is to find out how many birds are left after 2/5 of the remaining leave the cage. This is done by multiplying the original number of birds by 3/5, which gives 3x/5 birds left. The second step is to find out how many birds are left after 2/3 of the remaining leave the cage.

In this case, the four consecutive even numbers are 2, 4, 6, and 8, so the sum is 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20. Dividing the sum by 4 gives the average even number, which is 20/4 = 5.
