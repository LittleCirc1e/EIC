This is because the rower's speed in still water is 6 km/hr, and the river's flow speed is 3 km/hr. Therefore, the rower's average speed for the total journey is the sum of their speed in still water and the river's flow speed, which is 6 km/hr + 3 km/hr = 9 km/hr.\n\nHowever, the solution then incorrectly calculates the time taken to row upstream and downstream. The time taken to row upstream should be x/6, not x/3, since the rower's speed in still water is 6 km/hr. Similarly, the time taken to row downstream should be x/9, not x/6, since the river's flow speed is 3 km/hr.\n\nTherefore, the correct calculation for the total time taken is:\n\nTotal time taken = x/6 + x/9 = 2x/15\n\nAnd the correct calculation for the average speed is:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time = 2x/15\n\nSo, the correct answer is 2x/15, not 4.5."

This is because each box can contain at most 9 bars of chocolate, so the last box will contain the remaining bars, which is 6 bars in this case."
