        "question": "Factory x's bulbs work for over 5000 hours in 75% of cases, whereas factory y's bulbs work for over 5000 hours in 65% of cases. It is known that factory x supplies 70% of the total bulbs available. What is the chance that a purchased bulb will work for longer than 5000 hours?",
        "transformed_solution": "The chance of getting a bulb from factory x is 70% because factory x supplies 70% of the total bulbs available.\nThe chance of getting a working bulb from factory x is 75% because factory x's bulbs work for over 5000 hours in 75% of cases.\nThe chance of getting a bulb from factory y is 30% because 100% - 70% = 30%.\nThe chance of getting a working bulb from factory y is 65% because factory y's bulbs work for over 5000 hours in 65% of cases.\nThe overall chance of getting a working bulb is 70% x 75% + 30% x 65% = 52.5% + 19.5% = 72%.\n#### 72%",
        "label": "yes",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #3, which is your explanation about why the [Solution] is correct.\n\nThe student has correctly calculated the chance of getting a working bulb from factory x and factory y. However, the student has made a mistake in calculating the overall chance of getting a working bulb. The student has added the chance of getting a working bulb from factory x and factory y instead of multiplying them.\n\nThe correct calculation for the overall chance of getting a working bulb is:\n\n(70% x 75%) + (30% x 65%) = 52.5% + 19.5% = 72%.\n\nThe student has correctly arrived at the final answer of 72%. However, the reasoning process contains some errors that need to be addressed."
