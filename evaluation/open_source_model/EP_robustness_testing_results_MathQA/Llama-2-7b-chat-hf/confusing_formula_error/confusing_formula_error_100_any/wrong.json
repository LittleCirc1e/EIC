The train is moving at a speed of 60 kmph, and the man is running in the opposite direction at a speed of 6 kmph, so the relative speed is 60 - 6 = 54 kmph.\n\nTherefore, the time taken to pass the man is:\n\nTime taken to pass the man = Distance / Speed = 440 / 54 = 8 seconds.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 8 seconds."
