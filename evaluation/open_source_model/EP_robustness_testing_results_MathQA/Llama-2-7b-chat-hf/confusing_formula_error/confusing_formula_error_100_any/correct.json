The explanation is as follows:\n\nThe solution assumes that the new area is equal to the sum of the length and breadth of the original room plus the increase in length and breadth. However, this is not the correct formula for finding the perimeter of a room. The perimeter of a room is the distance around the room, and it is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides of the room. Therefore, the correct formula for finding the perimeter of a room is: Perimeter = 2(length + breadth + width).\n\nIn this case, the length and breadth of the original room are given as L and B, respectively, and the increase in length and breadth are given as y. Therefore, the perimeter of the new room can be calculated as: Perimeter = 2(L + y + B + y) = 2(L + 2y + B + 2y).\n\nSubstituting the values given in the problem, we get: Perimeter = 2(L + 2y + B + 2y) = 2(L + 2y + B + 2y) = 16.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: The perimeter of the new room is 16 feet."
