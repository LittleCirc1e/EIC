        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #.\n\nThe solution is incorrect because it assumes that the price of the article decreased by 24% of its original cost, which is not the case. The problem states that the price of the article costs Rs. 836 after a 24% decrease, which means that the original cost of the article was Rs. 1000 (836 / 0.76 = 1000). Therefore, the actual cost of the article is Rs. 1000, not Rs. 1100 as stated in the solution."

However, this is not correct because 3/5 of a number is not equal to the number multiplied by 0.5.\n\nTo solve the problem correctly, we need to use the formula: 3/5N = 36 / (50%), which gives us N = 120.\n\nTherefore, the solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #."
