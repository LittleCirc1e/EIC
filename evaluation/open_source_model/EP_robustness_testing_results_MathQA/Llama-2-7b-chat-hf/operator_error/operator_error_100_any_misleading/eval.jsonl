{"question": "circular gears l and r start to rotate at the same time at the same rate . gear l makes 20 complete revolutions per minute and gear r makes 40 revolutions per minute . how many seconds after the gears start to rotate will gear r have made exactly 6 more revolutions than gear l ?", "transformed_solution": "In one minute, gear l makes 20*60 = 1200 revolutions\nIn one minute, gear r makes 40*60 = 2400 revolutions\nIn one minute, gear r makes 2400-1200 = 1200 more revolutions than gear l\nIn one minute, gear r makes 1200/20 = 60 more revolutions than gear l\nGear r will make exactly 6 more revolutions than gear l in 60/10 = 6 seconds\n#### 6", "label": "yes", "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct. The explanation is:\n\nThe student's reasoning process is correct. They used the information that both gears start to rotate at the same time and rotate at the same rate to find the number of revolutions per minute for each gear. They then used the information that gear l makes 20 complete revolutions per minute and gear r makes 40 complete revolutions per minute to find the difference in revolutions between the two gears. Finally, they used the information that one minute is equal to 60 seconds to find the number of seconds it takes for gear r to make exactly 6 more revolutions than gear l.\n\nThe student's final answer of 6 seconds is correct."}
{"question": "If 853845 bars of chocolate need to be placed in little boxes and each box can contain at most 9 bars of chocolate, how many bars of chocolate will be in the last unfilled box?", "transformed_solution": "The number of bars of chocolate in the last unfilled box is the remainder after dividing 853845 by 9.\nSo, the number of bars of chocolate in the last unfilled box is 6.\n#### 6", "label": "yes", "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #.\n\nThe student's reasoning process is correct in that they divide 853845 by 9 to get the number of bars of chocolate that can fit in each box. However, their final answer of 6 is incorrect. The correct answer is 7.\n\nTo see why, let's continue the division:\n\n853845 / 9 = 94715\n\nSo, there will be 7 boxes left unfilled (94715 - 853845 = 93365). Each box can hold up to 9 bars of chocolate, so the total number of bars of chocolate in the last 7 boxes is:\n\n93365 x 9 = 853415\n\nTherefore, the number of bars of chocolate in the last unfilled box is 853415 - 853845 = 7."}

The possible values of x are not limited to 3 and 4, but rather any integer between 1 and 9 inclusive. To see why, consider the following:\n\n* 1 < x < 9: This interval includes the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n* 2 < x < 15: This interval includes the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n* 7 > x > \u20131: This interval includes the numbers 7, 8, and 9.\n* 4 > x > 0: This interval includes the numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n* x + 1 < 5: This interval includes the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of x are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
