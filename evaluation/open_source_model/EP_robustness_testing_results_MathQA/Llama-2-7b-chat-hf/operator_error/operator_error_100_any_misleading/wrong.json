However, they made an error in their calculation. They multiplied both sides of the equation by y, which resulted in y = 5 / 6, which is incorrect. The correct answer is y = 10 / 6."

The possible values of x are not limited to 3 and 4, but rather any integer between 1 and 9 inclusive. To see why, consider the following:\n\n* 1 < x < 9: This interval includes the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n* 2 < x < 15: This interval includes the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n* 7 > x > –1: This interval includes the numbers 7, 8, and 9.\n* 4 > x > 0: This interval includes the numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n* x + 1 < 5: This interval includes the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of x are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The student's answer of 3 and 4 is incorrect, as these values do not satisfy all of the given conditions."
