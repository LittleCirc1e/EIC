Finally, the student has incorrectly calculated the total time taken on Monday by adding the incorrect times for the first 32 miles and the remaining 68 miles.\n\nTo correctly solve the problem, we need to first calculate the time taken to drive 100 miles on Sunday at a constant speed of x miles per hour. This can be done by dividing 100 by x. Then, on Monday, we need to calculate the time taken to drive the first 32 miles at a speed of (2x) miles per hour, which is 32 / (2 * x). The time taken to drive the remaining 68 miles at a speed of x / 2 miles per hour is 68 / (x / 2). Finally, we add these two times to get the total time taken on Monday.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #.\n\nThe student's reasoning process and final answer contain several errors.
