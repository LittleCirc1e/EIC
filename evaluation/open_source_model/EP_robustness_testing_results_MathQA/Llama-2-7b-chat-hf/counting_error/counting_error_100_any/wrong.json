The time it took Daniel to drive back from work on Monday is longer than the time it took him to drive back from work on Sunday by what percent?",
        "transformed_solution": "On Sunday, the time it takes to drive 100 miles is 100 / x \nOn Monday, the time it takes to drive the first 32 miles at 2x mph is 32 / (2 * x) and the time it takes to drive the remaining 68 miles at x / 2 mph is 68 / (x / 2) \nThe total time on Monday is 32 / (2 * x) + 68 / (x / 2) = 16 / x + 136 / x = 152 / x \nThe total time on Sunday is 100 / x \nThe difference in time is 152 / x - 100 / x = 52 / x \nTo find the percentage increase, we take the difference (52 / x) and divide by the original time (100 / x), then multiply by 50 to get the percentage increase \n(52 / 100) * 50 = 26% \n#### 26%",

The explanation is that the total time on Monday is calculated correctly by multiplying the speed on Monday by the distance driven on Monday, and then subtracting the total time on Sunday by multiplying the speed on Sunday by the distance driven on Sunday. The percentage increase in time is calculated correctly by taking the difference in time and dividing by the original time, and then multiplying by 50 to get the percentage increase.
