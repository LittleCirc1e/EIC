The solution states that there are 500 gallons of sodium chloride in the solution, but this is not enough to account for the entire 3,000 gallons of water that evaporated. To determine the new percentage of sodium chloride in the solution, we need to divide the number of gallons of sodium chloride by the total volume of the solution after evaporation. In this case, the total volume of the solution after evaporation is 7,000 gallons, so the percentage of sodium chloride is actually #."

        "transformed_solution": "The relative speed of the train and the man is 60 + 6 = 66 kmph = 66*(5/18) m/s = 55/3 m/s.\nTime taken to pass the man = Distance/Speed = 440/(55/3) = 440*(3/55) = 24 seconds.\n#### 24",

The train is moving at a speed of 60 kmph, and the man is running in the opposite direction at a speed of 6 kmph, so the relative speed is 60 - 6 = 54 kmph.\n\nTherefore, the time taken to pass the man is:\n\nTime taken to pass the man = Distance / Speed = 440 / 54 = 8 seconds.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 8 seconds."
