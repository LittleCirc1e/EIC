{"question": "if x is an integer such that 1 < x < 9 , 2 < x < 15 , 7 > x > \u2013 1 , 4 > x > 0 , and x + 1 < 5 , then x is", "transformed_solution": "The overlapping intervals are:\n2 < x < 5\nTherefore the possible values of x are 3 and 4\n#### 3, 4", "label": "yes", "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #.\n\nThe student's reasoning process is correct in identifying the overlapping intervals, but their final answer is incorrect. The possible values of x are not limited to 3 and 4, but rather any integer between 1 and 9 inclusive. To see why, consider the following:\n\n* 1 < x < 9: This interval includes the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n* 2 < x < 15: This interval includes the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n* 7 > x > \u20131: This interval includes the numbers 7, 8, and 9.\n* 4 > x > 0: This interval includes the numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n* x + 1 < 5: This interval includes the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of x are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The student's answer of 3 and 4 is incorrect, as these values do not satisfy all of the given conditions."}
