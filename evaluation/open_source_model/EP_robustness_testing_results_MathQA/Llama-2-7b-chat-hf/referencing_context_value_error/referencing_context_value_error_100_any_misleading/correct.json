Firstly, the time it takes Bob to get to city B is not 5 hours, but 5.67 hours, since the distance is 220 miles and Bob is driving at a constant speed of 40 miles per hour. Secondly, the time it takes Alice to get to city B is not 4.5 hours, but 4.25 hours, since she leaves city A 30 minutes after Bob and drives at a constant speed of 40 miles per hour. Finally, Alice must exceed a constant speed of 220/4.25 = 52.8 miles per hour to arrive in city B before Bob, not 48.89 miles per hour. Therefore, the correct answer is #52.8."
