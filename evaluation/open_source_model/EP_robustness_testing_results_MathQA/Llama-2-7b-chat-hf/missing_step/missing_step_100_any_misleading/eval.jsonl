However, the student then calculated the time it takes to pass the telegraph post as the length of the train divided by the speed, which is incorrect. The time it takes to pass the telegraph post is actually the distance traveled by the train divided by its speed, not the length of the train divided by its speed.\n\nSo, the correct calculation for the time it takes to pass the telegraph post is:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n= 30 m / 10 m/s\n= 30 s\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 30 seconds."}
