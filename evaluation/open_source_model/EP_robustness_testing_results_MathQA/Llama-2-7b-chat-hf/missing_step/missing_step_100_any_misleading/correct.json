The reasoning process and final answer contain several errors.\n\nFirstly, the amount of work done by y in 15 days is not 1, but rather 15/2 = 7.5 days. This is because y worked for 5 days and left the job, so the remaining work is 1 - 5 = -4 days.\n\nSecondly, the amount of work remaining is not 0, but rather -4 days. This is because x alone needs to finish the remaining work, which is -4 days.\n\nLastly, the calculation for the number of days x alone needs to finish the remaining work is incorrect. The calculation should be 0 days, not 0 / (1/21) = 0 days.\n\nTherefore, the solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #."
