The required run rate in the remaining 40 overs should be 6.25 runs per over.The answer is: 6.25"

        "transformed_solution": "Each additional quarter of a mile costs $0.15, so (4.90 - 1.85) / 0.15 = 20.33\nThe maximum distance someone could travel is 20 * 0.25 = 5 miles\n#### 5",
        "label": "yes",
        "eval_result": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the maximum distance someone could travel with $4.90.\nLet's break down the information given:\nCost for the first quarter of a mile: $1.85\nCost for each additional quarter of a mile: $0.15\nTotal cost: $4.90\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\nCost for the first quarter of a mile + Cost for each additional quarter of a mile * Number of additional quarters = Total cost\n$1.85 + $0.15 * (20 - 1) = $4.90\nLet's simplify and solve for x:\n$1.85 + $0.15 * 19 = $4.90\n$1.85 + $2.95 = $4.90\nTo isolate x, we subtract $1.85 from both sides of the equation:\n$1.85 - $1.85 + $2.95 = $4.90 - $1.85\n$2.95 = $3.05\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by $0.15:\n$2.95 / $0.15 = $3.05 / $0.15\nx = 20\nThe value of x is 20.The answer is: 20"
