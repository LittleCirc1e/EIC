        "transformed_solution": "Let the income be x.\nHe spends 30% of x on petrol, so the expenditure on petrol is 0.3x.\nTherefore, the remaining income is 0.7x.\nShortly after, the house rent prices increased by 10%, and thus he had to spend an additional 10% on the new rent. So he actually spends 30% of the remaining income plus 10% of that amount on house rent, or (0.3 * 0.7x) * 1.1\nHe spends the balance on food, which is 0.7x - (0.3 * 0.7x) * 1.1 = 0.7x - 0.231x = 0.469x\nWe are given that he spends Rs. 300 on petrol, so 0.3x = 300\nSolving for x, we get x = 1000\nTherefore, after the rent increase, the expenditure on house rent is (0.3 * 0.7 * 1000) * 1.1 = 231\n#### 231",
