        "question": "sheila works 8 hours per day on monday, wednesday and friday, and 6 hours per day on tuesday and thursday. she does not work on saturday and sunday. she earns $504 per week. how much does she earn in dollars per hour?",
        "transformed_solution": "On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday she works 8 hours/day, so in total 8 * 2 = 16 hours\nOn Tuesday and Thursday she works 6 hours/day, so in total 6 * 2 = 12 hours\nThe total hours she works in a week is 16 + 12 = 28 hours\nTo find her hourly wage, we divide her weekly earnings by the total hours worked, 504 / 28 = 18\n#### 18",
        "label": "no",
        "eval_result": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the unknown variable in the given equation.\nThe equation is:\nx = 18\nTherefore, the value of the unknown variable x is 18.The answer is: 18"

        "question": "a lemonade stand sold only small and large cups of lemonade on tuesday . 4 / 5 of the cups sold were small and the rest were large . if the large cups were sold for 7 / 6 as much as the small cups , what fraction of tuesday ' s total revenue was from the sale of large cups ?",
        "transformed_solution": "Let's assume the total number of cups sold is represented by x\nThe number of small cups sold = 3/5 * x\nThe number of large cups sold = 2/5 * x\nThe revenue from small cups = (3/5 * x) * 1\nThe revenue from large cups = (2/5 * x) * 7/6\nThe total revenue = (3/5 * x) * 1 + (2/5 * x) * 7/6\nTo find the fraction of total revenue from the sale of large cups, we divide the revenue from large cups by the total revenue: (2/5 * x) * 7/6 / ((3/5 * x) * 1 + (2/5 * x) * 7/6)\n#### 14/27",
        "label": "no",
        "eval_result": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the total number of cups sold.\nLet's break down the information given:\nNumber of small cups sold: 3/5 * x\nNumber of large cups sold: 2/5 * x\nRevenue from small cups: (3/5 * x) * 1\nRevenue from large cups: (2/5 * x) * 7/6\nTotal revenue: (3/5 * x) * 1 + (2/5 * x) * 7/6\nWe need to find the fraction of total revenue from the sale of large cups, which is (2/5 * x) * 7/6 / ((3/5 * x) * 1 + (2/5 * x) * 7/6).\nLet's simplify and solve for x:\n(2/5 * x) * 7/6 / ((3/5 * x) * 1 + (2/5 * x) * 7/6) = 14/27\nTo simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by the denominators to get rid of the fractions:\n(2/5 * x) * 7 / ((3/5 * x) * 1 + (2/5 * x) * 7) = 14\n(2/5 * x) * 7 = (3/5 * x) * 1 * 14\n14 * 7 = 3 * 14 * x\n98 = 42 * x\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides by 42:\n98 / 42 = x\n2.24 = x\nThe value of x is 2.24.\nNote: Since the question asks for a fraction of the total revenue, we can round the value of x to the nearest whole number. In this case, x would be 2.The answer is: 2"

        "transformed_solution": "Total hours worked in a week = (8 * 2) + (6 * 2) = 16 + 12 = 28 hours\nShe earns $468 per week\nEarning per hour = 468 / 28\n#### 16.7142857143",
        "label": "no",
        "eval_result": "The solution is incorrect. The earning per hour should be calculated by dividing the total earnings by the total hours worked, not by the total hours worked divided by the number of days worked. Therefore, the correct earning per hour is $468 / 28 = $17.00.The answer is: 17"
