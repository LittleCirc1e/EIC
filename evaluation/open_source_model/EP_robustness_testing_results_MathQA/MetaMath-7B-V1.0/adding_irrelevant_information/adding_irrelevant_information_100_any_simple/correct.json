        "eval_result": "To determine if the solution is correct, we need to check if the average marks calculated is equal to the given answer of 68.6.\nLet's set up the equation:\nAverage marks = Total marks obtained / Total subjects\n68.6 = 343 / 5\nTo solve for the unknown variable, we multiply both sides of the equation by 5:\n5 * 68.6 = 343\n343 = 343\nSince the equation is true, the solution is correct.\nTherefore, the answer is 68.6.The answer is: 68.6"
