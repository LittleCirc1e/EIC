        "question": "the length of a rectangular plot is 10 mtr more than its width . the cost of fencing the plot along its perimeter at the rate of rs . 6.5 mtr is rs . 910 . the perimeter of the plot is ?",
        "transformed_solution": "Let the width of the plot be x meters\nSo the length of the plot is x+10 meters\nThe area of the plot is length * width = (x+10) * x = x^2 + 10x square meters\nThe cost of fencing the plot along its perimeter is given as 6.5 * (x^2 + 10x) = 910\nSo, x^2 + 10x = 910 / 6.5\nThis creates a quadratic equation, however, this is not the correct formula for perimeter\n#### This step is incorrect, yielding an incorrect solution",
