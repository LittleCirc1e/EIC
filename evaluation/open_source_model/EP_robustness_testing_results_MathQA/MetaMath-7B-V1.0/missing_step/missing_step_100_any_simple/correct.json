        "transformed_solution": "The speed is calculated as distance/time, so the speed is 600 meters / (1/12) hours = 600 x 12 = 7200 meters/hour.\nTo convert meters to kilometers, we divide the speed by 1000, so 7200 meters/hour = 7200/1000 = 7.2 km/hour.\nSo the speed is 7.2*60/5 = 86.4 km/hour.\n#### 86.4",
        "label": "no",
        "eval_result": "To determine if the solution is correct, we need to convert the speed from meters per hour to kilometers per hour and check if it matches the given answer.\nThe given answer is 86.4 km/hour.\nThe solution states that the speed is 7.2 km/hour.\nSince 7.2 km/hour is not equal to 86.4 km/hour, the solution is incorrect.\nTherefore, the answer is no.The answer is: 86.4"
