        "question": "A volume of 10976 l water is in a container of sphere. How many hemisphere of volume 4 l each will be required to transfer all the water into the small hemispheres?",
        "original_solution": "First, we need to find the radius of the large sphere using the formula V = (4/3) * pi * r^3\nTherefore, r = (3V / (4pi))^(1/3) = (3*10976 / (4*3.14))^(1/3)\nAfter calculation, we find r = 22 feet\nNext, we find the volume of a hemisphere using the formula V = (2/3) * pi * r^3\nV = (2/3) * 3.14 * 22^3 = (2/3) * 3.14 * 10648\nEach hemisphere has a volume of 707.72 l\nTherefore, the number of hemisphere required is 10976 / 4 = 2744\n#### 2744",
        "original_answer": 2744.0,
        "transformed_solution": "First, we need to find the radius of the large sphere using the formula V = (4/3) * pi * r^3\nTherefore, r = (3V / (4pi))^(1/3) = (3*10976 / (4*3.14))^(1/3)\nAfter calculation, we find r = 22 feet\nNext, we find the volume of a hemisphere using the formula V = 4 * pi * r^2\nV = 4 * 3.14 * 22^2 = 4 * 3.14 * 484\nEach hemisphere has a volume of 6075.36 l\nTherefore, the number of hemisphere required is 10976 / 4 = 2744\n#### 6075.36",

        "wrong_step": 4,
        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 4 confuses the volume and surface area of a hemisphere. The question requires that the volume of the hemisphere to be solved be equal to (2/3) * pi * r^3, rather than 4 * pi * r^2, which is equivalent to the surface area of a sphere, resulting in V = (2/3) * pi * r^3 in the original_solution becoming V = 4 * pi * r^2 in the transformed_solution. This leads to subsequent step 5 calculating the number of hemispheres required still using the original volume of 4 l for each hemisphere, although the calculated volume of a hemisphere has changed in step 4. As a result, the final answer changes, and the language descriptions remain unchanged. Only step 4 is using the wrong formula, while other steps maintain the correct calculations as per instructions.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 2744, and the explanation is that step 3 first makes a mistake in unit conversion and mistakenly believes that 1 cubic foot is equal to 484 cubic inches instead of 1728 cubic inches. The subsequent step 4 references the result of step 3, calculating 4 * 3.14 * 484 = 6075.36 instead of 4 * 3.14 * 1728 = 4096. The final incorrect answer is obtained by dividing the incorrect result of step 4 by 4."
