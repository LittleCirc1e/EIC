The question requires converting grams to kilograms by multiplying with the conversion factor 1/1000, resulting in 0.001 kg for 1 gram in the original_solution. By mistakenly using division instead of multiplication, we get 1000 kg for 1 gram in the transformed_solution. This incorrect operation results in a subsequent incorrect calculation in step 2, changing the correct volume calculation from 0.001 kg * (1,000,000 cubic centimeters / 200 kg) = 5 cubic centimeters to an incorrect calculation of 1000 kg * (1,000,000 cubic centimeters / 200 kg) = 5,000,000 cubic centimeters.
