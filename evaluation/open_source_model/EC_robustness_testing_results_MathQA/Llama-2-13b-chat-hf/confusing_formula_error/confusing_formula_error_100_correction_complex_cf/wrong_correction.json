        "question": "Carol and Jordan draw rectangles of equal area. If Carol's rectangle measures 5 inches by 24 inches and Jordan's rectangle is 8 inches long, how wide is Jordan's rectangle, in inches?",
        "original_solution": "The area of Carol's rectangle is 5*24=120 square inches\nSince the areas are equal, the area of Jordan's rectangle is also 120 square inches\nLet the width of Jordan's rectangle be x inches\nThen the length of Jordan's rectangle is 120/x inches\nGiven the length of Jordan's rectangle is 8 inches, we have 8*(120/x)=120\nSo, x=15\n#### 15",
        "original_answer": 15.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The area of Carol's rectangle is 5+24=29 square inches\nSince the areas are equal, the area of Jordan's rectangle is also 29 square inches\nLet the width of Jordan's rectangle be x inches\nThen the length of Jordan's rectangle is 29/x inches\nGiven the length of Jordan's rectangle is 8 inches, we have 8*(29/x)=29\nSo, x=29/8\n#### 3.625",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 mistakenly uses the formula for finding the perimeter of a rectangle (summing the lengths of all sides) instead of the correct formula for finding the area (length multiplied by width). The correct calculation for the area of Carol's rectangle should maintain the multiplication of length and width, but the transformation changes it to addition (5+24), resulting in 29 square inches instead of 120 square inches. Therefore, the entire equation in the subsequent steps changes to represent this incorrect rectangle area, resulting in an incorrect width (x) for Jordan's rectangle and an incorrect transformed answer.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 3.5, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 confuses the perimeter and area formulas of rectangle and it should calculate the area of the rectangle which is equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the length plus length plus width plus width, equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle. That means, it should calculate 5 inches * 24 inches = 120 square inches instead of 5 inches + 24 inches + 5 inches + 24 inches = 129 square inches. Step 5 miscalculates 29 square inches + 24 square inches + 3.625 square inches = 32.625 square inches instead of 120 square inches. And step 7 miscalculates 29 square inches - 32.625 square inches = 3.625 square inches instead of 29 square inches - 120 square inches = -90.375 square inches."

        "question": "A rectangular field has a length 10 meters more than its width. If the area of the field is 144, what is the length (in meters) of the rectangular field?",
        "original_solution": "Let the width be x meters\nThen the length is x+10 meters\nThe area of the field is given by length * width = (x+10)*x = 144\nExpanding the equation, we get x^2 + 10x - 144 = 0\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get x = (-10 + sqrt(10^2 - 4*1*(-144)))/2*1 = (-10 + 26)/2 = 16/2 = 8\nSo the width is 8 meters\nAnd the length is 8+10=18 meters\n#### 18",
        "original_answer": 18.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let the width be x meters\nThen the length is x+10 meters\nThe perimeter of the field is given by 2*(length + width) = 2*((x+10) + x) = 144\nExpanding the equation, we get 2x + 20 + 2x = 144\nSimplifying, we get 4x + 20 = 144\nSolving for x, we get 4x = 124\nSo the width is 124/4 = 31 meters\nAnd the length is 31+10=41 meters\n#### 41",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by the width. However, the transformed solution replaces the formula for area with the formula for perimeter, resulting in an incorrect expansion of 2*((x+10) + x) = 144 instead of (x+10)*x = 144. This affects the subsequent related steps, changing the quadratics and their resolution to a linear equation and its resolution. Note that the language description of step 3 < The area of the field is given by > remains unchanged in the transformed_solution as < The perimeter of the field is given by >, causing the mistake by changing the formula used without modifying the descriptive text. It should be also noted that the only error occurs in step 3, and the initial steps and definitions remain correct.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 40, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 confuses the perimeter and area formulas of rectangle and it should calculate the area of the rectangle which is equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the length plus length plus width plus width, equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle. That means, it should calculate 2x + 20 = 144 instead of 2*((x+10) + x) = 144. Step 5 miscalculates 2x + 20 = 144 instead of 2x + 20 + 2x = 144. And step 7 miscalculates 4x = 124 instead of 4x = 124 - 20 = 104. Therefore, the correct answer is 40."
