        "explanation": "Here, step 6 confuses the formula for calculating the area of a triangle with the formula for calculating the semi-perimeter of a triangle. The question requires that the area of the triangle to be solved be equal to 0.5 multiplied by the base multiplied by the height, rather than summing up the lengths of the three sides and dividing by 2, which is equivalent to the semi-perimeter of the triangle.

Note that the language description of step 6 \"So the area of the triangle is\" in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that this is a single step error where only the formula in step 6 has been confused while the previous steps are correct.
