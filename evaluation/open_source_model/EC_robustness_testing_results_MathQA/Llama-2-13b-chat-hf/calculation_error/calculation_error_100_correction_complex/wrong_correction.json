        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, step 3 has a calculation error where the original 320 * 0.05 = 16 is modified to 320 * 0.05 = 15. This wrong calculation in step 3 changes the correct amount of the second discount, and consequently, the following step 4 inherits this error, altering the subtraction to 320 - 15 = 305. Steps before the wrong step, such as 1 and 2, remain unaffected. The subsequent steps related to the wrong step have a single calculation error, and the final transformed answer has been revised to 305, differing from the original answer.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 282, and the explanation is that step 3 first makes a mistake in unit conversion and mistakenly believes that one hundred rupees have 8000 cents instead of 10000 cents, calculating 400 * 0.20 = 800 instead of 400 * 0.20 = 80. The subsequent step 4 references the result of step 3, calculating 800 - 80 = 720 instead of 400 - 80 = 320. The subsequent step 5 references the result of step 4, calculating 720 * 0.05 = 36 instead of 320 * 0.05 = 16. The final incorrect answer is due to the compounding of these two errors."
