        "explanation": "In this example, the calculation 1100 x 0.32 is incorrectly transformed to 350 in step 3 instead of the correct calculation, which is 352. The mistake is made without changing any operands or operators in the formula. Subsequently, related steps 4, 5, and 6 inherit the mistake, and the numbers in the formulas inherit the error from step 3. Step 4 is modified to 288 + 350 = 638, step 5 to 2000 - 638 = 1362, and step 6 to (1362 / 2000) x 100 = 68.1%. This results in a transformed answer of 68.1%, which is different from the original answer.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 68.0%, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nIn the solution, the calculation error occurs in the step where the number of boys passed is calculated. The formula used is (1100 x 0.32) = 350, but the correct calculation should be (1100 x 0.32) = 352.\n\nTherefore, the total number of candidates passed should be 638 + 352 = 990, and the total number of candidates failed should be 2000 - 990 = 1010. The percentage of failed candidates is (1010 / 2000) x 100 = 68.0%.\n\nThe solution is incorrect because the incorrect calculation of the number of boys passed leads to a series of subsequent errors, resulting in the final incorrect answer. The root cause of the mistake is the incorrect calculation of the number of boys passed."

Each associate professor has brought 2 pencils and 1 chart to the meeting, while each assistant professor has brought 1 pencil and 2 charts. If a total of 10 pencils and 8 charts have been brought to the meeting, how many people are present?",
        "original_solution": "Let a be the number of associate professors and b be the number of assistant professors.\n2a + b = 10 because each associate professor brought 2 pencils and each assistant professor brought 1 pencil.\na + 2b = 8 because each associate professor brought 1 chart and each assistant professor brought 2 charts.\nMultiplying the first equation by 2, we get 4a + 2b = 20.\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get 3a = 12.\nSo, a = 4.\nPlugging the value of a into the first equation, we get 2*4 + b = 10.\nSo, b = 2.\nThere are 4 associate professors and 2 assistant professors, so a total of 6 people are present.\n#### 6",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this case, the transformed_solution contains a miscalculation in step 4, where the multiplication of 2 by the first equation is incorrectly carried out as 4a + 2b = 22 instead of 4a + 2b = 20. This single error affects all subsequent steps that rely on it. As a result, step 5 becomes 3a = 14 rather than 3a = 12, and consequently in step 6, the value of a is incorrectly calculated using the wrong 3a value, giving a = 14 / 3 instead of 4. This error flows through to step 7, 8 and 9, where the value of b and the total number of people are calculated based on this incorrect number of associate professors a. Thus, the entire transformed solution carries the initial miscalculation through all related steps, resulting in a wrong answer of approximately 5.33 people instead of the correct answer of 6 people.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 5, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nIn the first equation, 2a + b = 10, we can see that the total number of pencils brought is 10, and the number of associate professors is 2a, so the number of assistant professors is b = 10 - 2a.\n\nIn the second equation, na + 2b = 8, we can see that the total number of charts brought is 8, and the number of associate professors is na, so the number of assistant professors is 2b = 8 - na.\n\nNow, let's substitute the value of a into the first equation: 2(14/3) + b = 10.\n\nWe can see that the value of b is 2/3, so the final answer is 5 (14/3 associate professors and 2/3 assistant professors).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 5, and the solution provided is incorrect."
