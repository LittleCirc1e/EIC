        "question": "gary’s gas station serves an average of 14 cars per hour on Saturdays, 10 cars per hour on Sundays, and 9 cars per hour on all other days of the week. if the station is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, how many cars does gary’s station serve over the course of a typical week?",
        "original_solution": "On Saturdays, the station serves cars for 16 hours (10 pm - 6 am + 1). So the total number of cars served on Saturdays is 14 cars/hour * 16 hours = 224 cars\nOn Sundays, the station serves cars for 16 hours. So the total number of cars served on Sundays is 10 cars/hour * 16 hours = 160 cars\nFrom Monday to Friday, the station serves cars for 16 hours/day * 5 days = 80 hours. So the total number of cars served from Monday to Friday is 9 cars/hour * 80 hours = 720 cars\nThe total number of cars served over a typical week is 224 + 160 + 720 = 1104 cars\n#### 1104",
        "original_answer": 1104,
        "transformed_solution": "On Saturdays, the station serves cars for 16 hours (10 pm - 6 am + 1). So the total number of cars served on Saturdays is 14 cars/hour * 16 hours = 224 cars\nOn Sundays, the station serves cars for 16 hours. So the total number of cars served on Sundays is 10 cars/hour * 16 hours = 160 cars\nFrom Monday to Friday, the station serves cars for 16 hours/day * 5 days = 80 hours. But a counting mistake makes it 16 hours/day * 4 days = 64 hours. So the total number of cars served from Monday to Friday due to the incorrect count is 9 cars/hour * 64 hours = 576 cars\nThe total number of cars served over a typical week with the mistaken count is 224 + 160 + 576 = 960 cars\n#### 960",
        "transformed_answer": 960,
        "wrong_step": 3,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 3 incorrectly counts the weekdays as 4 days instead of 5, changing the multiplication from 16 hours/day * 5 days to 16 hours/day * 4 days. This leads to the total hours served from Monday to Friday being 64 instead of 80, and the total number of cars served from Monday to Friday is calculated incorrectly as 9 cars/hour * 64 hours = 576 cars. This changes the overall total in step 4 from 224 + 160 + 720 = 1104 to 224 + 160 + 576 = 960. The counting error only affects the step it is introduced in and any subsequent steps that depend on the miscalculation.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 960, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nThe solution contains a counting mistake in the calculation of the number of cars served from Monday to Friday. The correct calculation should be 16 hours/day * 5 days = 80 hours, not 16 hours/day * 4 days = 64 hours. This mistake leads to an error of 576 cars (9 cars/hour * 64 hours). Therefore, the correct answer is 960 cars (224 cars on Saturdays + 160 cars on Sundays + 576 cars from Monday to Friday)."
