        "question": "every day daniel drives 120 miles back from work . on sunday , daniel drove all the way back from work at a constant speed of x miles per hour . on monday , daniel drove the first 32 miles back from work at ( 2 x ) miles per hour , and the rest of the way at ( x / 2 ) miles per hour . the time it took daniel to drive back from work on monday is longer than the time it took him to drive back from work on sunday by what percent ?",
        "original_solution": "The time it took Daniel to drive back from work on Sunday is 120 / x\nThe time it took Daniel to drive back from work on Monday is 32 / (2x) + 88 / (x/2)\n32 / (2x) simplifies to 16 / x and 88 / (x/2) simplifies to 176 / x\nSo, the total time on Monday is 16 / x + 176 / x = 192 / x\nThe time difference is 192 / x - 120 / x = 72 / x\nTo find the percent increase, we calculate (72 / x) / (120 / x) * 100 = 60%\n#### 60",

        "explanation": "Here, step 6 should have the correct calculation of the percent increase using the values from steps 4 and 5. However, the calculation has been erroneously changed from 60% to 80% without justification, which is not a result of a counting error from the previous steps. The error does not affect the calculations of the time it took for Daniel to drive back home on Sunday and Monday but only alters the percent increase calculation step, thus changing the final percent from the correct value of 60% to an incorrect value of 80%.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 60%, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nThe time difference between Sunday and Monday is 72/x miles, which is the distance Daniel drove on Monday minus the distance he drove on Sunday. To find the percent increase, we need to divide the time difference by the time it took on Sunday, then multiply by 100.\n\n(72/x) / (120/x) * 100 = 1.5 * 100 = 60%\n\nTherefore, the time it took Daniel to drive back from work on Monday is 60% longer than the time it took him to drive back from work on Sunday."

        "question": "gary’s gas station serves an average of 14 cars per hour on Saturdays, 10 cars per hour on Sundays, and 9 cars per hour on all other days of the week. if the station is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, how many cars does gary’s station serve over the course of a typical week?",
        "original_solution": "On Saturdays, the station serves cars for 16 hours (10 pm - 6 am + 1). So the total number of cars served on Saturdays is 14 cars/hour * 16 hours = 224 cars\nOn Sundays, the station serves cars for 16 hours. So the total number of cars served on Sundays is 10 cars/hour * 16 hours = 160 cars\nFrom Monday to Friday, the station serves cars for 16 hours/day * 5 days = 80 hours. So the total number of cars served from Monday to Friday is 9 cars/hour * 80 hours = 720 cars\nThe total number of cars served over a typical week is 224 + 160 + 720 = 1104 cars\n#### 1104",
        "original_answer": 1104,
        "transformed_solution": "On Saturdays, the station serves cars for 16 hours (10 pm - 6 am + 1).

So the total number of cars served on Sundays is 10 cars/hour * 16 hours = 160 cars\nFrom Monday to Friday, the station serves cars for 16 hours/day * 5 days = 80 hours. But a counting mistake makes it 16 hours/day * 4 days = 64 hours. So the total number of cars served from Monday to Friday due to the incorrect count is 9 cars/hour * 64 hours = 576 cars\nThe total number of cars served over a typical week with the mistaken count is 224 + 160 + 576 = 960 cars\n#### 960",

        "wrong_step": 3,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 3 incorrectly counts the weekdays as 4 days instead of 5, changing the multiplication from 16 hours/day * 5 days to 16 hours/day * 4 days. This leads to the total hours served from Monday to Friday being 64 instead of 80, and the total number of cars served from Monday to Friday is calculated incorrectly as 9 cars/hour * 64 hours = 576 cars. This changes the overall total in step 4 from 224 + 160 + 720 = 1104 to 224 + 160 + 576 = 960. The counting error only affects the step it is introduced in and any subsequent steps that depend on the miscalculation.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 1080 cars, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nIn the solution, there is a counting error in the calculation of the number of cars served from Monday to Friday. The correct calculation should be 16 hours/day * 5 days = 80 hours, not 16 hours/day * 4 days = 64 hours. This error leads to an overestimation of the total number of cars served over a typical week.\n\nThe correct calculation of the total number of cars served over a typical week is:\n\n224 cars (Saturdays) + 160 cars (Sundays) + 80 cars (Monday to Friday) = 1080 cars.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 1080 cars."
