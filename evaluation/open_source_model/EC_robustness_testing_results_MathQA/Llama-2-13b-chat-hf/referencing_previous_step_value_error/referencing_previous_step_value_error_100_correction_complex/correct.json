It should be noted that step 1 in the transformed_solution <2y = 10> should be the same as step 1 in the original_solution <2y = 10> and calculates its result 10 correctly. The error is only in step 2, where a different value is substituted for 2y.

The subsequent step 4 references the result of step 3, calculating 10 + 2(5) = 12 instead of 20 + 2(5) = 24.
