        "original_solution": "It takes her 6 days to complete 1 work because 6 x 1 = 6\nIt takes her 18 days to complete 3 works because 6 x 3 = 18\n#### 18",
        "original_answer": 18.0,
        "transformed_solution": "It takes her 6 days to complete 1 work because 6 / 1 = 6\nIt takes her 6 days to complete 3 works because 6 / 3 = 2\n#### 2",

        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example changes the multiplication in step 2 into division, converting \"6 x 3 = 18\" to \"6 / 3 = 2\". This operators change leads to an incorrect result in this step, affecting the final transformed answer to 2 instead of 18. The mistake is confined to the operation in step 2, but the calculation of the result is correct within the context of the modified formula. The subsequent steps and the overall calculation logic were adjusted based on the modified step, ensuring that the error did not propagate further by misapplying operations based on the incorrect result.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 18, and the explanation is that step 2 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 6 / 3 = 2 instead of 6 / 3 = 6. The subsequent step 3 references the result of step 2, calculating 2 x 6 = 12 instead of 2 x 6 = 12. The subsequent step 4 references the result of step 3, calculating 12 / 1 = 12 instead of 12 / 3 = 4. The final incorrect answer is obtained by adding the results of steps 3 and 4. Therefore, the correct answer is 18, and the explanation is that step 2 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, leading to the subsequent steps making errors in their calculations."
