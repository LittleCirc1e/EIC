        "original_solution": "Let the total worth of the stock be x.\nProfit from 10% of stock = 0.1 * x * 20/100\nLoss from remaining 90% of stock = 0.9 * x * 5/100\nOverall loss = 0.1 * x * 20/100 - 0.9 * x * 5/100 = 400\n0.02x - 0.045x = 400\n-0.025x = 400\nx = 400 / -0.025\nx = -16000\nThe total worth of the stock is -16000\n#### -16000",

        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is -26666.67, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nIn the solution, the first error occurs in step #005, where the formula for the profit from 10% of the stock is incorrect. The formula should be 0.15x*20/100 instead of 0.15*x*20/100. This error propagates to the subsequent steps, leading to the final incorrect answer.\n\nThe correct solution is as follows:\n\nLet the total worth of the stock be x.\n\nProfit from 10% of stock = 0.15x*20/100\nLoss from remaining 90% of stock = 0.9x*5/100\nOverall loss = 0.15x*20/100 - 0.9x*5/100 = 400\n\n0.03x - 0.045x = 400\n-0.015x = 400\nx = 400 / -0.015\nx = -26666.67\n\nThe total worth of the stock is -26666.67."

        "explanation": "Step 2 references 8 in the original solution as 6 wrongly, and calculates 6/40=0.15 km/day instead of 8/40=0.2 km/day. Its subsequent related steps, step 3 and 4, will be affected by the erroneous rate calculated in step 2. Step 3 changes the calculation to 0.15/0.1 x 30=45, and step 4 changes the extra men needed to 45-30=15. Please note that you should only consider one error, so the steps before the erroneous step still reference 8 km as remaining correctly, and the steps after will inherit the result from the wrong step but still use the correct logic based on the erroneous rate.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 12, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nThe given formula is:\n\nExtra men he must employ = (Desired rate - Current rate) / (Current rate x Number of men)\n\nIn this case, the desired rate is 0.15 km/day, and the current rate is 0.1 km/day, so:\n\nExtra men he must employ = (0.15 - 0.1) / (0.1 x 30)\n\n= 12 / 30\n\n= 12\n\nTherefore, the engineer must employ 12 extra men to finish the work in time."
