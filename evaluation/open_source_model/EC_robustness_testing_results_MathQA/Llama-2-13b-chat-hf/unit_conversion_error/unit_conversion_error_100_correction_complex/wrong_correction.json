        "original_solution": "First, let's convert the distance from meters to kilometers. 600 meters = 0.6 kilometers.\nNext, let's convert the time from minutes to hours. 5 minutes = 5/60 = 1/12 hours.\nNow, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time. So, the speed is 0.6 km / (1/12) hours = 0.6 * 12 = 7.2 km/hr.\n#### 7.2",

So, the speed is 0.6 km / (1/10) hours = 0.6 * 10 = 6 km/hr.\n#### 6",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 makes incorrect unit conversion by representing 1 hour as having 50 minutes instead of 60, which changes the time conversion from 5 minutes = 5/60 = 1/12 hours in the original_solution to 5 minutes = 5/50 = 1/10 hours in the transformed_solution. As a consequence, the subsequent related step 3 changes from 0.6 km / (1/12) hours = 7.2 km/hr to 0.6 km / (1/10) hours = 6 km/hr. It should be noted that only the unit conversion in step 2 is affected, while the calculations in step 1 and the rest of the process remain correct.",

The subsequent step 4 reference the result of step 3, calculating 0.6 km / (1/10) hours = 0.6 * 10 = 6 km/hr instead of 0.6 km / (1/12) hours = 0.6 * 12 = 10 km/hr.
