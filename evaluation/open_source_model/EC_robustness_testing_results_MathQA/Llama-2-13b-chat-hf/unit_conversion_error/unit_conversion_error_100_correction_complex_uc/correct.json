        "original_solution": "First, convert 36 kilometers per hour to meters per second: 36 kilometers/hour * 1000 meters/kilometer * 1 hour/3600 seconds = 10 meters/second.\nThen, calculate the time it takes to travel 600 meters at 10 meters/second: 600 meters / 10 meters/second = 60 seconds.\n#### 60",

        "transformed_solution": "First, convert 36 kilometers per hour to meters per second: 36 kilometers/hour * 1000 meters/kilometer * 1 hour/4000 seconds = 9 meters/second.\nThen, calculate the time it takes to travel 600 meters at 9 meters/second: 600 meters / 9 meters/second = 66.67 seconds.\n#### 66.67",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 hour is wrongly equal to 4000 seconds instead of 3600 seconds, resulting in 36 kilometers/hour * 1000 meters/kilometer * 1 hour/3600 seconds = 10 meters/second in the original_solution becoming 36 kilometers/hour * 1000 meters/kilometer * 1 hour/4000 seconds = 9 meters/second in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent related step 2, which changes from 600 meters / 10 meters/second = 60 seconds to 600 meters / 9 meters/second = 66.67 seconds. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 60 seconds, and the explanation is that step 1 makes an incorrect unit conversion, mistakenly assuming that 1 hour has 4000 seconds instead of 3600 seconds, and wrongly calculates 36 kilometers/hour * 1000 meters/kilometer * 1 hour/4000 seconds = 9 meters/second instead of 36 kilometers/hour * 1000 meters/kilometer * 1 hour/3600 seconds = 10 meters/second.

        "question": "A train covers a distance of 12 km in 10 minutes. If it takes 6 seconds to pass a telegraph post, then the length of the train is",
        "original_solution": "First, convert the time from minutes to seconds: 10 minutes * 60 seconds per minute = 600 seconds.\nNext, use the formula speed = distance/time to find the speed of the train: speed = 12 km / 600 seconds = 0.02 km/s.\nThen, convert the speed from km/s to m/s: 0.02 km/s * 1000 m per km = 20 m/s.\nNow, use the speed of the train to find the length of the train when it takes 6 seconds to pass a telegraph post: length = speed * time = 20 m/s * 6 s = 120 meters.\n#### 120",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes incorrect unit conversion by assuming 1 minute is equal to 50 seconds instead of 60 seconds, resulting in 10 minutes * 60 seconds per minute = 600 seconds in the original_solution becoming 10 minutes * 50 seconds per minute = 500 seconds in the transformed_solution. This error then affects the subsequent steps related to the trainâ€™s speed and length calculations, without affecting any previous or unrelated steps. Thus, step 2 changes from a speed calculation using the correct time to using the incorrect time resulting in a speed of 0.02 km/s to 0.024 km/s, step 3 correctly converts the incorrect speed to meters per second, and the final step 4 yields a longer length of the train from using this value and the time it takes to pass the telegraph post.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 120, and the explanation is that step 3 makes an incorrect unit conversion, mistakenly assuming that 1 second has 50 seconds instead of 60 seconds, and wrongly calculates 6 x 50=300 instead of 6 x 60=360. This affects step 4, which erroneously calculates 300/12=25 instead of 360/12=30."
