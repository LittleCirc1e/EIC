        "question": "an engineer undertakes a project to build a road 10 km long in 60 days and employs 30 men for the purpose . after 20 days , he finds only 2 km of the road has been completed . find the ( approximate ) number of extra men he must employ to finish the work in time .",
        "original_solution": "In 20 days, 2 km of the road have been completed, so the rate is 2/20 = 0.1 km/day.\nTo finish the remaining 8 km in 40 days, the rate required is 8/40 = 0.2 km/day.\nThe current rate of each man is 0.1 km/day, so the number of men required to achieve the desired rate is 0.2/0.1 x 30 = 60.\nExtra men he must employ is 60 - 30 = 30.\n#### 30",
        "original_answer": 30.0,
        "transformed_solution": "To finish the remaining 8 km in 40 days, the rate required is 8/40 = 0.2 km/day.\nThe current rate of each man is 2 km / (30 men * 20 days) = 0.0033 km/day/man approximately.\nSo the number of men required to achieve the desired rate is 0.2 / 0.0033 = 60.6060 approximately, rounded to 61 men.\nExtra men he must employ is 61 - 30 = 31.\n#### 31",
        "transformed_answer": 31.0,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "missing_step",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The original step 1 has been deleted, and the transformed_solution starts with the original step 2 which references the 8 km to be finished and the 40 remaining days from the question. The original step 3 calculates the rate per man as 0.1 km/day, but this erroneous result is changed in the transformed_solution to calculate the rate per man using the given data directly, which is 2 km / (30 men * 20 days), and is used to find the new estimate of men needed. Subsequent steps calculate the new number of men and extra men needed accordingly, resulting in a first erroneous step that has no references to the deleted step 1. The new transformed_solution has one less step, a different outcome of 31 extra men instead of 30, and the first reference to the erroneous calculation is the transformed step 1.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 35, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nThe given solution is incorrect because it assumes that all 30 men are working at a constant rate throughout the 20 days, which is not the case. The correct approach is to calculate the number of men required based on the actual progress made so far.\n\nAfter 20 days, 2 km of the road has been completed, which means that each man has completed approximately 0.067 km (2 km / 30 men). To finish the remaining 8 km in 40 days, the required rate is 8/40 = 0.2 km/day.\n\nTherefore, the number of men required to achieve the desired rate is 0.2 / 0.067 = 30.77 approximately, rounded to 31 men. The extra men he must employ is 31 - 30 = 1.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 35 men, which is the total number of men required to finish the road in 40 days, including the 30 men already employed and the 5 extra men required to achieve the desired rate."
