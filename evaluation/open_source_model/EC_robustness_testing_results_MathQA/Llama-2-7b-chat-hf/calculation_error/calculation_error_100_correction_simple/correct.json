        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates 10 x (23+2) as 240 instead of 250 in step 2. The subsequent step inherits this incorrect result for calculating the new average. Step 3 changes the correct operation 250 / 10 to 240 / 10 due to the error introduced in step 2. The calculation error here does not affect step 1 or any other unrelated steps.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #25.\n\nExplanation: The solution is incorrect because it does not take into account the carryover of the original sum from the previous step. In step 3, the sum of the first 9 numbers is 9 x 23 = 197, and the carryover from the previous step is 23 + 2 = 25. Therefore, the new sum is 197 + 25 = 222, and the new average is 222 / 10 = 22.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the formula for finding the average of a set of numbers, which is (sum of all numbers) / (number of numbers). In this case, the sum of all numbers is 230, and the number of numbers is 10, so the new average is (230) / (10) = 23.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is #25, and the explanation is #25."

Instead of calculating 2700 / (30 x 6) = 15 properly, the transformed solution incorrectly states 2700 / (30 x 6) = 10. The mistake is only in the second step's calculation, and it does not require changing the operands or operators. It only changes the result, which leads to a different final answer. The earlier step of calculating the total man hours remains unchanged, as does the equation in the erroneous step (which still uses 30 x 6 correctly); only the final result from the dubious calculation is altered.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #15 days.\n\nExplanation: The solution is incorrect because there is a calculation error in step 3.

As a result, step 5 becomes 3a = 14 rather than 3a = 12, and consequently in step 6, the value of a is incorrectly calculated using the wrong 3a value, giving a = 14 / 3 instead of 4.
