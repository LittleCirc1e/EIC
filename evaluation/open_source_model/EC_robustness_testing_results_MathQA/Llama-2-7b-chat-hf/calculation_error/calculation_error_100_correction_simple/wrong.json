        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this case, the error has been introduced at the final step of the calculation. The correct evaluation of |-6| should be 6, but in the transformed solution, it has been evaluated incorrectly as 4. This leads to the final transformed expression being 79 - 4 = 75 instead of the correct 79 - 6 = 73. All other steps are performed correctly, and only the final calculation has been altered, changing the final answer and introducing a single error.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. The solution correctly solves the inner parentheses and then multiplies the result by the appropriate sign to get the final answer. The explanation is that the inner parentheses were solved correctly, and the result was multiplied by the appropriate sign to get the final answer.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to assist you with anything else."
