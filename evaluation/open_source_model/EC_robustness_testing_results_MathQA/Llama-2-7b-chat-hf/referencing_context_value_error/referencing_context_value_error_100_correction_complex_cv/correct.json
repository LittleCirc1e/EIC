This wrong percentage directly affects the calculation of the profits for 1999 and the final percentage comparison between profits of 1999 and 1998. The correct calculation using 30 percent should yield 70 percent, but because of the incorrect percentage used in step 3, the transformed solution yields 60 percent.
