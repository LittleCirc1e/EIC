        "explanation": "Step 2 references 282 in the question as 280 wrongly, and calculates 280 - 32 = 248 instead of 282 - 32 = 250. The subsequent related step 3 will reference the erroneous result from step 2, calculating 248 / 40 = 6.2 instead of 250 / 40 = 6.25. However, it is still calculated correctly under the assumption that step 2 is correct. Please note that you should only consider one error, so step 1 still references 3.2 in the question correctly.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #.\n\nThe team scored 3.2 x 10 = 32 runs in the first 10 overs, which means they scored an average of 3.2 runs per over in the first 10 overs. To reach the target of 282 runs in the remaining 40 overs, the team needs to score 282 - 32 = 250 runs, which means they need to score an average of 6.25 runs per over in the remaining 40 overs. Therefore, the correct answer is #6.25.\n\nExplanation: The mistake in the solution is that it calculated the required run rate based on the total number of overs, rather than the number of overs remaining. By considering the number of overs remaining, we can calculate the required run rate accurately."
