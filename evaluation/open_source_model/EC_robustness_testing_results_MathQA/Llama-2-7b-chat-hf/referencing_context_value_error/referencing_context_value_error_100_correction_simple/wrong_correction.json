The formula used in the solution is (100 - (100 - 25)) * (100 - 10) / 100, which is equal to 32.5%. However, this formula does not take into account the compounding effect of the percentage decrease over two years. To calculate the total percent decrease, we need to use the formula (100 - value1) + (100 - value2) - value1, where value1 and value2 are the values of the baseball card at the end of the first and second years, respectively. Using this formula, we can calculate the total percent decrease of the baseball card's value over two years as (100 - 25) + (100 - 10) - 25 = 40%. Therefore, the correct answer is 40%."
