        "explanation": "Step 3 references the percent decrease in revenues as 40 percent instead of 30 percent, and calculates the revenues in 1999 as 0.6x instead of 0.7x. This wrong percentage directly affects the calculation of the profits for 1999 and the final percentage comparison between profits of 1999 and 1998. The correct calculation using 30 percent should yield 70 percent, but because of the incorrect percentage used in step 3, the transformed solution yields 60 percent.

This leads to a 20% error in the calculation of the profits in 1999, resulting in a final answer of 70% instead of 60%.\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct calculation for the revenues in 1999 is:\n\nRevenues in 1999 = (1 - 0.3) * Revenues in 1998 = 0.5 * 100 = 50\n\nTherefore, the profits in 1999 are:\n\nProfits in 1999 = 0.1 * 50 = 0.05\n\nThe final answer is 70% instead of 60% because (0.05 / 0.1x) * 100 = 70."
