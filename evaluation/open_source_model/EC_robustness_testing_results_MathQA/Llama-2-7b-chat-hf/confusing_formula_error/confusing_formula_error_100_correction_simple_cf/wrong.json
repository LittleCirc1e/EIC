However, in the transformed_solution, the surface area formula for a rectangular box is mistakenly used instead, which is given by the formula SA = 2*(length*width + width*height + height*length). As a result, the calculation changes from V = 28 * 10 * 5 = 1400 cubic meters in the original_solution to V = 2*(28*10 + 10*5 + 5*28) = 2*(280 + 50 + 140) = 2*470 = 940 cubic meters in the transformed_solution, leading to a different answer.

The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width, and the perimeter be twice the sum of the length and width. The change in the transformed_solution is the swap of the formulas for area and perimeter, resulting in 'Area = L * W = 300' becoming 'Perimeter = L + L + W + W = 300' and 'Perimeter = 2L + 2W = 70' becoming 'Area = 2L + 2W', with the rest of the steps incorrectly based on this swapped premise. This results in an incorrect transformed_answer of 50 meters for the width, instead of the correct answer of 15 meters.

The language description in the transformed_solution remains unchanged, consistent with the directive to only modify the relevant formulae and not the wordings.",

The solution is correct because it uses the correct formula for the area of a rectangle, which is 2L + 2W, and it also uses the correct formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is L + L + W + W. The solution correctly identifies the width of the rectangle as 50 meters, which is the value that satisfies the second equation.\n\nAlternatively, if the solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #, and the explanation is #. In this case, the solution is incorrect because it does not use the correct formula for the area of a rectangle.

The perimeter of a square is given by 4 times the side length, while the area is given by the side squared. Thus, in the transformed solution, the calculation of the actual area of the square is mistakenly changed from x^2 to 4*x, the formula for the perimeter. This in turn affects step 4, changing the calculation of the area with the error from (1.04x)^2 to simply 4*1.04x, and this will affect the final error percentage calculation in step 5. We have to recalculate the error percentage based on the incorrect area calculation, yielding a transformed answer of 4%.
