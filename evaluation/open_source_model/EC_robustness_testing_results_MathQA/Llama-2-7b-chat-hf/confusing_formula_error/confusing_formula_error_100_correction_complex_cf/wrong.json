        "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the area formula of a rectangle with the perimeter formula. The problem asks to calculate the area which should be computed by multiplying length by width. In the transformed solution, we mistakenly add all four sides together, 12 + 5 + 12 + 5, which is how one would calculate the perimeter, not the area. The step's language description 'So, the area of the garden is' remains the same as in the original solution even though the calculation uses the wrong formula. Just one step (step 2) includes the formula error, while all other calculation processes are still correct. This error leads to the subsequent answer being different from the original answer.",

The question requires that the bottom area of the cistern to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than adding the length to width and multiplying by 2, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle, resulting in 8*6=48 square meters in the original_solution becoming 2*(8+6)=2*14=28 square meters in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 6, changing from 48+35=83 square meters to 28+35=63 square meters. Note that the language description of step 4 < The bottom area is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 1 mistakenly uses the formula of rectangular area, while the other calculation processes post the error are affected assuming the wrong value is correct, and the processes prior to the error remain unaffected.",
