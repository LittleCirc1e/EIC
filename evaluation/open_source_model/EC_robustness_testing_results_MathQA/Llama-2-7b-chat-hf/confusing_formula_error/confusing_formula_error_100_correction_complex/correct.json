        "question": "If the diagonal of a rectangle is 17 cm long and its perimeter is 46 cm, find the area of the rectangle.",
        "original_solution": "Let the length and width of the rectangle be l and w, respectively.\nWe have the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: 2*(l+w)=46\nSo, l+w=23\nWe also have the Pythagorean theorem for the diagonal of a rectangle: l^2 + w^2 = diagonal^2\nSo, l^2 + w^2 = 17^2\nAnd we know that l+w=23, so we can solve for l and w using a system of equations.\nBy substituting w=23-l into the equation l^2 + w^2 = 17^2, we get l^2 + (23-l)^2=17^2\nBy solving this equation, we get l=15 and w=8\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle is l*w = 15*8 = 120 square cm\n#### 120",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 8 confuses the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The question requires calculating the area of the rectangle by multiplying length by width (l*w), but instead, the sum of the lengths and widths is calculated, which is a method for finding the perimeter of a rectangle. This results in the original solution of finding area by '15*8 = 120 square cm' being wrongly changed to '15+8+8+15 = 46 square cm' in the transformed solution. Note that the language description in all steps, particularly in the wrong step 8, < Therefore, the area of the rectangle is >, remains unchanged as in the original solution. In this example, only step 8 mistakenly uses the perimeter formula for the rectangle area calculation, while the formulas for other steps are correct.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #, and the explanation is #.\n\nThe mistake in the solution is in step 5, where the author mistakenly believes that the Pythagorean theorem can be applied to find the length of the diagonal of a rectangle. In fact, the Pythagorean theorem only applies to right triangles, and the diagonal of a rectangle is not a right angle. Therefore, the formula for the diagonal of a rectangle is not l^2 + w^2, but rather l \\* w.\n\nSo, the correct calculation for the area of the rectangle is:\n\nArea = l \\* w = 15 \\* 8 = 120 square cm\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 120."
