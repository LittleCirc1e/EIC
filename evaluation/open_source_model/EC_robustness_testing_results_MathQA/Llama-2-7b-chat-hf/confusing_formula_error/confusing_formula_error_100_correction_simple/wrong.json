        "explanation": "Here, step 3 in the original solution makes a mistake by confusing the formula for calculating the area of a square with the perimeter formula. The perimeter of a square is given by 4 times the side length, while the area is given by the side squared. Thus, in the transformed solution, the calculation of the actual area of the square is mistakenly changed from x^2 to 4*x, the formula for the perimeter. This in turn affects step 4, changing the calculation of the area with the error from (1.04x)^2 to simply 4*1.04x, and this will affect the final error percentage calculation in step 5. We have to recalculate the error percentage based on the incorrect area calculation, yielding a transformed answer of 4%. Note that the language description of step 3 in the original solution <The actual area of the square is > remains unchanged in the transformed solution. The other steps related to calculation in the transformed solution are adjusted accordingly to maintain logical coherence after the initial error.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. The calculation of the error percentage in the calculated area is correct, and the explanation of how the error occurred is also correct. The single type of error that occurs in one step is the measurement of the side length, which is 4% in excess. Therefore, the final answer is 4%."

        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the formula for the surface area of a cube. The correct formula for the surface area of a cube is to multiply the area of one face by 6, since a cube has 6 faces with equal area. The original_solution correctly states this as 6 * (16 cm * 16 cm). However, in the transformed_solution, the formula has been incorrectly changed to use the sum of the lengths of the edges squared, represented as (6 * (16 cm + 16 cm + 16 cm)^2), which results in an incorrect surface area calculation. The language description of 'The surface area of a cube is' remains unchanged, and the other calculation steps are still correctly portraying their respective formulas.",
