The explanation is as follows:\n\nThe first year's decrease is 20%, so the card's value after one year is 80% of its original value. In the second year, the card's value decreases another 10%, so the card's value after two years is 70% of its original value. Therefore, the total percent decrease of the card's value over the two years is 40% (70% - 80%).\n\nThe solution is incorrect because it uses a formula that is not applicable to this problem.
