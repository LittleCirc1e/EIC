        "question": "the speed of a car is 90 km in the first hour and 30 km in the second hour. what is the average speed of the car?",
        "original_solution": "The total distance traveled is 90 + 30 = 120 km\nThe total time taken is 1 + 1 = 2 hours\nThe average speed is 120 / 2 = 60 km/h\n#### 60",
        "original_answer": 60.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total distance traveled is 90 - 30 = 60 km\nThe total time taken is 1 + 1 = 2 hours\nThe average speed is 60 / 2 = 30 km/h\n#### 30",
        "transformed_answer": 30.0,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The example alters the addition in the first step, changing the operator from addition (+) to subtraction (-), hence calculating 90 - 30 = 60 km instead of 90 + 30 = 120 km. This incorrect total distance affects the subsequent calculation of average speed, where 60 km is divided by the total time (which remains 2 hours correctly) to produce an average speed of 30 km/h. All other calculations are correct, but the wrongful change of the operator in step 1 leads to a transformed answer that is different from the original.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #.\n\nThe solution is incorrect because in step 3, the formula for calculating the average speed is incorrect. The formula should be:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\n\nIn this case, the total distance traveled is 90 km + 30 km = 120 km, and the total time taken is 2 hours. Therefore, the correct calculation for the average speed is:\n\nAverage speed = 120 km / 2 hours = 60 km/h\n\nSo, the correct answer is #60 km/h."
