        "original_solution": "The loss is 1500 - 1290 = 210\nThe loss percentage is (210/1500) * 100 = 14%\n#### 14",
        "original_answer": 14.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The loss is 1500 + 1290 = 2790\nThe loss percentage is (2790/1500) * 100 = 186%\n#### 186",

        "explanation": "This example changes the subtraction in step 1 to addition, changing 1500 - 1290 = 210 to 1500 + 1290 = 2790 by changing - to +. This new result then carries over to step 2, affecting the calculation of the loss percentage. The transformed calculation for loss percentage becomes (2790/1500) * 100 = 186% as a result of the incorrect loss value. It should be noted that step 1 only changes the operator of the formula, but still uses the correct calculation method for the new operator. Step 2 correctly applies the transformed loss value to calculate the loss percentage.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #.\n\nThe error occurs in step 3, where the calculation of the loss percentage is incorrect. The correct calculation is:\n\nLoss = Cost price - Selling price = Rs. 1500 - Rs. 1290 = Rs. 210\n\nLoss percentage = (Loss/Cost price) * 100 = (210/1500) * 100 = 14.0%\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is #14.0%."
