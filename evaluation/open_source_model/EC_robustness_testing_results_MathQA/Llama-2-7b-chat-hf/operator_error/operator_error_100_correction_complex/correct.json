        "explanation": "This example turns the modulus operator in step 1 into multiplication, and by changing % to *, the expression 15 % u = 4 becomes 15 * u = 4. This changes the context and meaning of the problem and does not make sense as the question asks for a remainder of 4 when 15 is divided by u. Therefore, there are no values of u that satisfy this altered equation, and the number of valid u values becomes 0 as opposed to 1 in the original solution.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 1, and the explanation is that step 1 first makes a mistake in the calculation process, calculating 15 * 11 = 165 instead of 15 * 11 = 165. The subsequent step 2 references the result of step 1, calculating 0 instead of 1, resulting in the final incorrect answer."

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this example, the multiplication operator in step 1 has been changed to division, thus incorrectly calculating the number of girls as 160 / 1/2 = 320 instead of 160 x 1/2 = 80. This results in an impossible count of boys, calculated in step 2 as 160 - 320 = -160, which is not a feasible number of students. The original count was 80 boys, so the transformation caused by the operator error in step 1 led to a nonsensical answer. Every step's calculation is correct except for the incorrect application of the operator in step 1.",
