Alice leaves 30 minutes after Bob, which means she has a head start of 30 minutes. Therefore, Alice's speed should be calculated based on the distance traveled in the time she has available, which is 1.2 hours in this case.\n\nTo calculate Alice's speed, we need to divide the distance by the time available: 60 miles / 1.2 hours = 50 miles per hour.

Specifically, the solution mistakenly assumes that the distance from the home to the school is also 35 times the speed at which the child walks, which is not the case.\nTo correct this mistake, we can see that the distance from the home to the school is actually 6 minutes times the speed at which the child walks, which is 5 m/min. Therefore, the distance from the home to the school is 6 x 5 = 30 meters.\nSo, the correct answer is #30, and the explanation is #."
