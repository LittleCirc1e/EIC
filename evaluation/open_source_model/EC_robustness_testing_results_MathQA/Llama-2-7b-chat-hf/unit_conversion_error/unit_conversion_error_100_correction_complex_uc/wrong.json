And it affects the subsequent related step 3, which changes from 90 minutes to 75 minutes. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, so the calculations in steps 1 and 2 and the unit conversion in step 1 are still correct.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. The calculation of relative speed is correct, and the calculation of time to meet is also correct. The conversion from hours to minutes is also accurate. Therefore, the answer is 75 minutes."

        "original_solution": "The old machine makes 100 bolts per hour and the new machine makes 150 bolts per hour.\nTogether, they make 100 bolts/hour + 150 bolts/hour = 250 bolts per hour.\nTo make a total of 500 bolts, it will take 500 bolts / 250 bolts/hour = 2 hours.\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so it will take 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes for the two machines to make a total of 500 bolts.\n#### 120",

        "original_solution": "Let x be the capacity of the tank in litres.\nThe inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute, so in 12 hours it fills 6 * 12 * 60 = 4320 litres.\nThe leak can empty the tank in 6 hours, so in 12 hours it can empty 2x litres.\nNow, 4320 - 2x = x.

And it affects the subsequent related step 4, which changes from 4320 - 2x = x to 3600 - 2x = x and the solution from x = 4320 to x = 3600 / 3 = 1200 litres for the capacity of the tank.
