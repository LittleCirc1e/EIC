        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. In this case, there is no single type of error that occurs in one step, but rather a series of errors that occur throughout the calculation. First, step 1 assumes that Kramer can pack 10 boxes per minute, but this is incorrect, as there are 5 boxes in each case. Therefore, in step 2, the calculation of 10/5 = 2 is incorrect. Finally, in step 3, the calculation of 200 cases is incorrect because of the mistake in step 2. To correct the solution, we need to divide 10 by 5 to get the correct number of boxes per case, which is 2. Then, we can calculate the number of cases in 2 hours by multiplying the number of boxes per minute by the number of minutes in 2 hours. The correct answer is 400 cases."
