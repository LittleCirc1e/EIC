        "question": "a crow leaves its nest, and flies back and forth from its nest to a nearby ditch to gather worms. the distance between the nest and the ditch is 200 meters. in one and a half hours, the crow manages to bring worms to its nest 15 times. what is the speed of the crow in kilometers per hour?",
        "original_solution": "The total distance traveled by the crow is 200 meters * 2 (round trip) * 15 = 6000 meters.\nOne and a half hours is equal to 1.5 hours.\nTo convert meters to kilometers, we divide by 1000, so 6000 meters / 1000 = 6 kilometers.\nThe speed of the crow is the total distance (6 kilometers) divided by the total time (1.5 hours), so 6 / 1.5 = 4 kilometers per hour.\n#### 4",
        "original_answer": 4.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total distance traveled by the crow is 200 meters * 2 (round trip) * 15 = 6000 meters.\nOne and a half hours is equal to 1.5 hours.\nTo convert meters to kilometers, we divide by 500, so 6000 meters / 500 = 12 kilometers.\nThe speed of the crow is the total distance (12 kilometers) divided by the total time (1.5 hours), so 12 / 1.5 = 8 kilometers per hour.\n#### 8",
        "transformed_answer": 8.0,
        "wrong_step": 3,
        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 3 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 kilometer is wrongly equal to 500 meters instead of 1000 meters, resulting in 6000 meters / 1000 = 6 kilometers in the original_solution becoming 6000 meters / 500 = 12 kilometers in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 4, which changes from 6 / 1.5 = 4 kilometers per hour to 12 / 1.5 = 8 kilometers per hour. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. The crow's speed is 8 kilometers per hour. The calculation is correct, and the unit conversion is accurate.\n\nThe solution is incorrect, and the correct answer is #. The crow's speed is actually 12 kilometers per hour. The calculation is correct, but the unit conversion from meters to kilometers is incorrect. The correct conversion is 6000 meters / 500 = 12 kilometers per hour.\n\nPlease provide the correct answer and explanation."
