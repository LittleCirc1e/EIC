        "question": "5 bells begin to toll together at 12:00 noon and toll respectively at intervals of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 seconds. Not including the toll at 12:00 noon, how many more times will all 5 bells toll together before 1:00 pm (i.e., one hour later)?",
        "original_solution": "The least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 is 420 seconds.\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.\nSince 420 seconds go into 3600 seconds about 8 times (420 * 8 = 3360), all 5 bells will toll together 8 times within the hour.\n#### 8",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 makes an incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 minute is wrongly equal to 50 seconds instead of 60 seconds, resulting in 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in the original_solution becoming 60 * 50 = 3000 seconds in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 3, which changes from 420 * 8 = 3360 to 420 * 7 = 2940. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, so the calculation process of step 1 and the other unrelated processes are still correct.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #8.\n\nExplanation:\nThe LCM of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 is actually 2100 seconds, not 420 seconds. This means that there are 2100 / 5 = 420 times that the bells will toll together within an hour. Therefore, the answer is 8."
