        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #, and the explanation is #.\n\nIn step 6, the calculation 504 / 28 = 18 is incorrect because it does not take into account the different number of hours worked on each day. To calculate the hourly wage accurately, you need to divide the weekly earnings by the total number of hours worked on each day, not the total number of hours in a week.\n\nFor example, on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sheila works 8 hours/day, so her hourly wage is $504 / 8 = 62.50 dollars/hour. On Tuesday and Thursday, she works 6 hours/day, so her hourly wage is $504 / 6 = 84.00 dollars/hour.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 62.50 dollars/hour on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and 84.00 dollars/hour on Tuesday and Thursday."

        "original_solution": "The total number of trucks rented out during the week is 26 - 14 = 12 trucks\nSince 50% of the rented out trucks were returned by Saturday morning, the total number of trucks rented out during the week is 12 / (50/100) = 24 trucks\n#### 24",
