        "question": "a car consumes 210 liters of petrol weekly. for how many days will 1470 liters of petrol be sufficient?",
        "original_solution": "The number of weeks it takes to consume 1470 liters is 1470 / 210 = 7 weeks\nThere are 7 days in a week, so the number of days 1470 liters will be sufficient is 7 * 7 = 49 days\n#### 49",
        "original_answer": 49.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The number of weeks it takes to consume 1470 liters is 1470 / 210 = 7 weeks\nThere are 6 days in a week, so the number of days 1470 liters will be sufficient is 7 * 6 = 42 days\n#### 42",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 incorrectly states that there are 6 days in a week instead of 7 days. This error modifies the result of the multiplication in step 2, changing it from 7 * 7 = 49 days to 7 * 6 = 42 days. The count of days in a week is the only change made, and thus only the transformed_answer is affected while the division calculation remains correct.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #49 days.\n\nExplanation: The error in the solution is a counting error, specifically, counting Saturday and Sunday as 3 days instead of 2 days. Therefore, the number of days 1470 liters will be sufficient is 7 weeks \\* 7 days/week = 49 days."

        "question": "one week , a certain truck rental lot had a total of 26 trucks , all of which were on the lot monday morning . if 50 % of the trucks that were rented out during the week were returned to the lot on or before saturday morning of that week , and if there were at least 14 trucks on the lot that saturday morning , what is the greatest number of different trucks that could have been rented out during the week ?",
        "original_solution": "The total number of trucks rented out during the week is 26 - 14 = 12 trucks\nSince 50% of the rented out trucks were returned by Saturday morning, the total number of trucks rented out during the week is 12 / (50/100) = 24 trucks\n#### 24",

And it affects the subsequent related step, changing the computed total number of trucks rented out during the week from 24 to 26. It should be noted that only one step of counting error is considered, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #24.\n\nExplanation:\nThe calculation of the total number of trucks rented out during the week is incorrect. The correct calculation is:\n\nTotal number of trucks rented out = Total number of trucks on Monday morning - Number of trucks returned by Saturday morning\n\nUsing the information given in the question, we can calculate the total number of trucks rented out as follows:\n\nTotal number of trucks rented out = 26 - 14 = 12\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of different trucks that could have been rented out during the week is 12."
