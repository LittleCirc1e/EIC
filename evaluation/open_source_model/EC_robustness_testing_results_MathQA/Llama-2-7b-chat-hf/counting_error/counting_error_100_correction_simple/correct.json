        "question": "John had a stock of 1400 books in his bookshop. He sold 75 on Monday, 50 on Tuesday, 64 on Wednesday, 78 on Thursday, and 135 on Friday. What percentage of the books were not sold?",
        "original_solution": "Total books sold from Monday to Friday is 75 + 50 + 64 + 78 + 135 = 402 books\nThe remaining books after these sales is 1400 - 402 = 998 books\nThe percentage of the books not sold is (998 / 1400) * 100 = 71.2857%\nThe percentage of the books not sold is approximately 71.29%\n#### 71.29",
        "original_answer": 71.29,
        "transformed_solution": "Total books sold from Monday to Friday is 75 + 50 + 64 + 78 + 135 = 402 books\nThe remaining books after these sales is 1400 - 402 = 998 books\nThe percentage of the books not sold is (998 / 1400) * 100 = 71.2857%\nThe percentage of the books not sold is approximately 71%\n#### 71",

        "explanation": "Here, the final step inaccurately rounds the percentage from 71.2857% to 71% instead of the correct 71.29% as per the original solution. This causes the transformed answer to be different from the original answer, creating a rounding error at step 4. It's important to note that the counting in earlier steps is unchanged, with only the final rounding step being affected.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #.\n\nThe solution is incorrect because the calculation of the remaining books after sales is incorrect. The correct calculation is:\n\nTotal books sold from Monday to Friday is 75 + 50 + 64 + 78 + 135 = 402 books\nRemaining books after sales = 1400 - 402 = 998 books\n\nThe percentage of the books not sold is (998 / 1400) * 100 = 71.2857%\nThe percentage of the books not sold is approximately 71.29%\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is #71.29%."

        "question": "a car consumes 210 liters of petrol weekly. for how many days will 1470 liters of petrol be sufficient?",
        "original_solution": "The number of weeks it takes to consume 1470 liters is 1470 / 210 = 7 weeks\nThere are 7 days in a week, so the number of days 1470 liters will be sufficient is 7 * 7 = 49 days\n#### 49",
        "original_answer": 49.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The number of weeks it takes to consume 1470 liters is 1470 / 210 = 7 weeks\nThere are 6 days in a week, so the number of days 1470 liters will be sufficient is 7 * 6 = 42 days\n#### 42",

        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 incorrectly states that there are 6 days in a week instead of 7 days. This error modifies the result of the multiplication in step 2, changing it from 7 * 7 = 49 days to 7 * 6 = 42 days. The count of days in a week is the only change made, and thus only the transformed_answer is affected while the division calculation remains correct.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #49 days.\n\nExplanation: The solution assumes that the car consumes petrol at a constant rate of 210 liters per week. However, this is not the case as the car's consumption rate may vary depending on various factors such as driving habits, traffic conditions, and road terrain. Therefore, to accurately determine the number of days 1470 liters of petrol will be sufficient, we need to consider these factors and calculate the car's average weekly consumption rate. Based on this calculation, we can determine that 1470 liters of petrol will be sufficient for 49 days."

        "question": "If the 5th date of a month is Tuesday, what date will be 3 days after the 3rd Friday in the month?",
        "original_solution": "The 3rd Friday in the month will be the date 15 (since the 1st date is Tuesday and the 8th date is also Tuesday)\n3 days after the 3rd Friday will be the date 18\n#### 18",
        "original_answer": 18,

        "wrong_type": "counting_error",

        "explanation": "Here, the error is the result of miscounting the days after the 3rd Friday. Originally, 3 days after the 3rd Friday being the 15th would be the 18th, but in the transformed_solution, 3 days are incorrectly added to become the 19th. This counting error affects only the step where the days after the 3rd Friday are computed, without changing the calculation of the 3rd Friday's date itself.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #18.\n\nExplanation: The 3rd Friday in the month is actually the 18th day of the month, not the 19th. Therefore, 3 days after the 3rd Friday will be the 21st day of the month."

        "question": "one week , a certain truck rental lot had a total of 26 trucks , all of which were on the lot monday morning . if 50 % of the trucks that were rented out during the week were returned to the lot on or before saturday morning of that week , and if there were at least 14 trucks on the lot that saturday morning , what is the greatest number of different trucks that could have been rented out during the week ?",
        "original_solution": "The total number of trucks rented out during the week is 26 - 14 = 12 trucks\nSince 50% of the rented out trucks were returned by Saturday morning, the total number of trucks rented out during the week is 12 / (50/100) = 24 trucks\n#### 24",
        "original_answer": 24,
        "transformed_solution": "The total number of trucks rented out during the week is 26 - 13 = 13 trucks\nSince 50% of the rented out trucks were returned by Saturday morning, the total number of trucks rented out during the week is 13 / (50/100) = 26 trucks\n#### 26",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 erroneously counts the trucks on the lot as being 13 instead of 14 on Saturday morning, resulting in the calculation being changed from 26 - 14 = 12 trucks to 26 - 13 = 13 trucks. And it affects the subsequent related step, changing the computed total number of trucks rented out during the week from 24 to 26. It should be noted that only one step of counting error is considered, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #24.\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution assumes that all 26 trucks were rented out during the week, which is not the case. According to the question, 50% of the trucks that were rented out during the week were returned to the lot on or before Saturday morning, which means that 13 trucks were rented out during the week. Therefore, the greatest number of different trucks that could have been rented out during the week is 24."
