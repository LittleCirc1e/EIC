On Sundays, the station serves 10 cars per hour, and it is open for 16 hours, so the total number of cars served is 10 cars/hour * 16 hours = 160 cars. From Monday to Friday, the station serves 9 cars per hour, and it is open for 4 days, so the total number of cars served is 9 cars/hour * 4 days = 36 cars.
