This change affects the calculation in step 3, resulting in the number of trucks that could have been rented out and returned by Saturday being calculated as 10 * 2 = 20. Subsequently, step 4 incorrectly concludes that at most 20 different trucks could have been rented out over the week, rather than the original 24.
