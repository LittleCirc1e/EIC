        "question": "A bag contains 3 blue and 5 white marbles. One by one, marbles are drawn out randomly until only two are left in the bag. What is the probability that out of the two, one is white and one is blue?",
        "original_solution": "First, calculate the probability of drawing one white and one blue marble from the bag.\nThe probability of drawing a white marble first is 5/8, and the probability of drawing a blue marble next is 3/7.\nThe probability of drawing a blue marble first is 3/8, and the probability of drawing a white marble next is 5/7.\nAdd the two probabilities together: (5/8 * 3/7) + (3/8 * 5/7) = 15/56 + 15/56 = 30/56 = 15/28\n#### 15/28",
        "original_answer": "15/28",
        "transformed_solution": "First, calculate the probability of drawing one white and one blue marble from the bag, considering there is an additional red marble in the bag making it 3 blue, 5 white, and 1 red marble.\nThe probability of drawing a white marble first is now 5/9, and the probability of drawing a blue marble next is 3/8.\nThe probability of drawing a blue marble first is 3/9 (1/3), and the probability of drawing a white marble next is 5/8.\nAdd the two probabilities together: (5/9 * 3/8) + (1/3 * 5/8) = 15/72 + 15/72 = 30/72 = 5/12\n#### 5/12",
        "transformed_answer": "5/12",
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "adding_irrelevant_information",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 1 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement by supposing there is an additional red marble in the bag, which changes the total number of marbles and affects the probabilities calculated. As a result, the probability calculations in the transformed_solution incorrectly account for the total number of marbles as 9 instead of 8, and thus the answer is altered from 15/28 in the original_solution to 5/12 in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that even though this change affects multiple probabilities calculated later in the solution, it originates from a single point of error in the initial assumption.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #.\n\nThe error in the solution occurs in step 3, where the probability of drawing a blue marble first is calculated as 3/9 instead of 1/3. This leads to an incorrect calculation of the final probability. The correct calculation is:\n\nThe probability of drawing a blue marble first is 1/3, and the probability of drawing a white marble next is 5/8.\n\nThe probability of drawing a blue marble first and then a white marble next is 1/3 * 5/8 = 5/24.\n\nAdding the probabilities of the two steps together gives us the final probability: 5/24.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is #5/24."
