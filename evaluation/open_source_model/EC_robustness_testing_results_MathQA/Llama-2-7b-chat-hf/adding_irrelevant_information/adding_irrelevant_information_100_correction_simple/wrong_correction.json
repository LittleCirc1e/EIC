The transformed_solution includes this irrelevant additional information, changing the number of muffins from 10 in the original_solution to 11 in the transformed_solution.

        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #15.\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution is incorrect because it assumes that the ratio of doughnuts, cookies, and muffins remains the same after 5 extra doughnuts were found. However, the ratio may have changed after the extra doughnuts were added. To calculate the correct number of muffins, we need to recalculate the ratio based on the new total number of parts.\n\nThe total parts in the ratio are now 5 + 3 + 1 = 9. Therefore, the number of muffins in the shop is 9 x 1 = 9.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 15 muffins in the shop."
