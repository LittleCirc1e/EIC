        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #45.\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution is incorrect because it assumes that the tree will grow 50 plums during its 6th year, when in fact it will grow 45 plums. The solution also incorrectly calculates the number of plums the tree will grow during its 6th year by subtracting 5 from the number of plums it grew during its 5th year, rather than subtracting 5 from the tree's age.\n\nTo get the correct answer, we need to calculate the number of plums the tree will grow during its 6th year by subtracting 5 from the tree's age, which is 5 years old at the start of its 6th year. Therefore, the number of plums the tree will grow during its 6th year is 50 - 5 = 45."
