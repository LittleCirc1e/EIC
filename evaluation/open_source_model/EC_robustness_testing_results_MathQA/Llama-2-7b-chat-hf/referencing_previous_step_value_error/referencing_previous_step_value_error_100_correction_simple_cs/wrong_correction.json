        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #96.67.\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution is incorrect because it assumes that the weight of dry grapes in 20 kgs of raisins is 14 kgs, which is not correct. The weight of dry grapes in 20 kgs of raisins is actually 16 kgs, which can be calculated by subtracting the weight of water in 20 kgs of raisins (5 kgs) from the weight of raisins in 20 kgs (20 - 5 = 15 kgs). Therefore, the weight of fresh grapes needed to get 20 kgs of raisins is actually 96.67 kgs, not 93.33 kgs as stated in the solution."
