        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly calculates the result of the equation 3x = 2x + 15 as x = 13 instead of the correct x = 15. The resultant third number derived from x + 4 should be 17 instead of 19, leading to a different transformed_answer. The error is isolated to step 4 and does not affect the restatement of the problem in previous steps, nor the correct procedure in the last step, just the numerical value obtained. Therefore, all steps besides the wrong step still reference the results correctly, despite the originating error in step 4, and the transformed_answer is different from the original_answer.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #19.\n\nExplanation: The error occurs in the second step, where the equation 3x = 2(x+4) + 7 is written. The value of x+4 is 7, so the equation becomes 3x = 2(7) + 7 = 3x = 14 + 7 = 21. Therefore, the final answer is x = 19."

        "original_solution": "This means 30 percent of the distribution is between m and m + d because 60 / 2 = 30\nSince the distribution is symmetric, 50 percent of the distribution is less than m.\nSo, the total percent of the distribution that is less than m + d is 50 + 30 = 80 percent\n#### 80",

The subsequent related step 3 uses the erroneous result of step 1 to calculate the distribution that is less than m + d. It should be noted that step 3, although related to the error in step 1, should correctly use the erroneous number from step 1 to perform the calculation and changes 50 + 30 = 80 to 50 + 35 = 85. Since this transformation only involves one error of referencing, and all other references to this mistaken number must use it as is, without correcting the original mistake.

        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #80.\n\nThe explanation is:\nThe solution is incorrect because it does not take into account the symmetry of the distribution. Since 60 percent of the distribution lies within one standard deviation of the mean, this means that 40 percent of the distribution lies outside of one standard deviation of the mean. Therefore, the total percent of the distribution that is less than m + d is 40 + 35 = 75 percent, not 85 percent as stated in the solution."
