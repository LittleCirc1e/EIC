        "question": "a metallic sheet is of rectangular shape with dimensions 48 m x 36 m. From each of its corners, a square is cut off so as to make an open box. If the length of the square is 8 m, the volume of the box (in m cube) is:",
        "original_solution": "The length of the box is 48 - 2*8 = 32 m\nThe width of the box is 36 - 2*8 = 20 m\nThe height of the box is 8 m\nThe volume of the box is 32 * 20 * 8 = 5120 m^3\n#### 5120",
        "original_answer": 5120.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The length of the box is 48 - 2*8 = 32 m\nThe width of the box is 36 - 2*8 = 20 m\nThe height of the box is 8 m\nThe volume of the box is 32 * 20 * 6 = 3840 m^3\n#### 3840",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references 8 as 6 from step 3 and changes 32 * 20 * 8 to 32 * 20 * 6. It should be noted that step 3 in the transformed_solution <The height of the box is 8 m> should be the same as the step 3 in the original_solution <The height of the box is 8 m> and calculates its result 8 correctly. Step 4, as the subsequent related step of step 3, is affected by step 3 and changes 32 * 20 * 8 = 5120 m^3 to 32 * 20 * 6 = 3840 m^3. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all steps is still correct.",
