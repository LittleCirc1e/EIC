        "explanation": "Step 4 mistakenly references 8 as 6 from step 3 and changes 32 * 20 * 8 to 32 * 20 * 6. It should be noted that step 3 in the transformed_solution <The height of the box is 8 m> should be the same as the step 3 in the original_solution <The height of the box is 8 m> and calculates its result 8 correctly. Step 4, as the subsequent related step of step 3, is affected by step 3 and changes 32 * 20 * 8 = 5120 m^3 to 32 * 20 * 6 = 3840 m^3. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all steps is still correct.",
