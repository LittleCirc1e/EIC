        "explanation": "This example removes the step that interprets the proportion 0.75/x = 5/8. It goes directly to the cross-multiplication step, which is typically derived from understanding the properties of the proportion. By skipping the proportion setup phase, the subsequent calculation uses direct cross-multiplication without stating the reason, jumping into the arithmetic part: 0.75*8 = 5*x. As the deleted step does not produce a numerical result for reference, and it's an intermediate step where the following step correctly references the numbers from the question, we use those numbers (0.75 and 8, choosing the larger one, which is 8) directly for the cross-multiplication. However, while the arithmetic operation in the transformed step 1 is correct, the ensuing calculation in step 2 incorrectly divides by 5 when it should correctly divide by 5 as in the original solution (and originally explained in the deleted step) but does not. As a consequence of this error, the derived answer of 1.5 in the transformed answer is distinct from the correct original answer of 1.2. It is step 2 in the transformed_solution, which is step 4 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing the incorrect number in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 2.",

To find the value of x, we cross-multiply and divide by 5 to get x = 0.75 x 8 / 5 = 1.2. Therefore, the answer is 1.2."

Instead of initiating with letting x be the smallest of the consecutive even numbers, the transformation starts by dividing the total sum by 4 to find the 'average' even number (step 2). The error is compounded by an incorrect formula to find the largest number based on the incorrect average (step 3), giving 148 instead of 76.

Since step 1 is removed, the transformed_solution directly divides the total length of the yard by the number of trees, instead of the number of gaps. Thus, it incorrectly references 32 instead of 31 for calculating the length of each gap.

To better fit the transformed solution dynamically, we round off the error to 3 decimal places after the decimal point as 0.028, referring directly to the original length value from the question for the calculation of the percentage error. This change results in the formula in the transformed solution to be (0.028/61.5)*100, which is slightly different from the original due to the approximation (61.5 instead of 61.472 as the denominator) and therefore leads to a different transformed_answer of 0.04553%.
