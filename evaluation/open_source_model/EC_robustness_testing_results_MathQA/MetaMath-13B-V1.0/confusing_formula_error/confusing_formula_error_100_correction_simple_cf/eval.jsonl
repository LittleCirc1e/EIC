{"question": "A rectangular field has a length 10 meters more than its width. If the area of the field is 144, what is the length (in meters) of the rectangular field?", "original_solution": "Let the width be x meters\nThen the length is x+10 meters\nThe area of the field is given by length * width = (x+10)*x = 144\nExpanding the equation, we get x^2 + 10x - 144 = 0\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get x = (-10 + sqrt(10^2 - 4*1*(-144)))/2*1 = (-10 + 26)/2 = 16/2 = 8\nSo the width is 8 meters\nAnd the length is 8+10=18 meters\n#### 18", "original_answer": 18.0, "transformed_solution": "Let the width be x meters\nThen the length is x+10 meters\nThe perimeter of the field is given by 2*(length + width) = 2*((x+10) + x) = 144\nExpanding the equation, we get 2x + 20 + 2x = 144\nSimplifying, we get 4x + 20 = 144\nSolving for x, we get 4x = 124\nSo the width is 124/4 = 31 meters\nAnd the length is 31+10=41 meters\n#### 41", "transformed_answer": 41.0, "wrong_step": 3, "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error", "is_single_error": true, "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by the width. However, the transformed solution replaces the formula for area with the formula for perimeter, resulting in an incorrect expansion of 2*((x+10) + x) = 144 instead of (x+10)*x = 144. This affects the subsequent related steps, changing the quadratics and their resolution to a linear equation and its resolution. Note that the language description of step 3 < The area of the field is given by > remains unchanged in the transformed_solution as < The perimeter of the field is given by >, causing the mistake by changing the formula used without modifying the descriptive text. It should be also noted that the only error occurs in step 3, and the initial steps and definitions remain correct.", "eval_result": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the width of the rectangular field.\nWe know that the length is 10 meters more than the width. Therefore, the length is x + 10.\nThe perimeter of the field is given by 2*(length + width) = 144.\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\n2*(x + 10) + 2*x = 144\nLet's simplify and solve for x:\n2x + 20 + 2x = 144\n4x + 20 = 144\nTo isolate x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:\n4x + 20 - 20 = 144 - 20\n4x = 124\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:\nx = 124 / 4\nx = 31\nThe width of the rectangular field is 31 meters.\nTherefore, the length is x + 10 = 31 + 10 = 41 meters.\nThe value of x is 31.The answer is: 31"}
{"question": "A cube has a volume of 64 cubic feet. If a similar cube is twice as long, twice as wide, and twice as high, then the volume, in cubic feet, of such cube is?", "original_solution": "Let the original side length be x.\nThe original volume of the cube is x^3=64\nSolving for x, we find x=4\nThe new side length is 2x=2*4=8\nThe new volume of the cube is (2x)^3=8^3=512\n#### 512", "original_answer": 512.0, "transformed_solution": "Let the original side length be x.\nThe original volume of the cube is 3*x*x=64\nSolving for x, we find x is approximately 4.62\nThe new side length is 2x=2*4.62=9.24\nThe new volume of the cube is (2x)^3=9.24^3=787.305\n#### 787.305", "transformed_answer": 787.305, "wrong_step": 2, "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error", "is_single_error": true, "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the volume and surface area of a cube. The question requires that the volume of the cube to be solved be equal to the side length cubed, not 3 times the square of the side length, which is a dimensionally incorrect representation of surface area (and not even the correct formula for surface area). This error results in the original equation x^3=64 being replaced by 3*x*x=64, thus solving for x gives an incorrect value, approximately 4.62 instead of the correct 4. The subsequent steps apply the incorrect side length to determine the new cube's measurements and volume. Therefore, step 2 from  x^3=64 has been modified to 3*x*x=64 in the transformed_solution, and this single incorrect application of a formula results in a subsequently incorrect computed volume of 787.305 cubic feet instead of the correct 512 cubic feet. The language description in step 2, <The original volume of the cube is> remains unchanged in the transformed_solution.
