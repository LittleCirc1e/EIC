        "explanation": "This example contains a miscalculation in step 2 where 0.9y/0.45 is calculated as 1.8y instead of the correct 2y. Subsequent steps are affected since they use the result of this wrong step. Step 3 remains unchanged because it does not depend on the result from step 2. Step 4, however, uses the wrong result 1.8y instead of 2y, so the equation 2(0.75x) is replaced with 1.8(0.75x), resulting in 1.35x instead of the correct 1.5x. This leads to the final incorrect statement that z is 135% of x instead of 150%. It is important that the formula in step 4 inherits and uses the erroneous result from step 2, yet the process of multiplication is carried out correctly based on the incorrect input.",

Since the error occurred in the computation of Expenditure, the subsequent Savings calculation (step 5) also needs to incorporate this error. We continue with the correct method for subtraction in step 5, but use the erroneous Rs. 12000 for Expenditure instead of the correct Rs. 13600. The calculation for the previous steps remains unaffected, therefore, these steps are unchanged. The error leads to the wrong conclusion that the Savings are Rs. 5000 instead of the correct Rs. 3400.",
