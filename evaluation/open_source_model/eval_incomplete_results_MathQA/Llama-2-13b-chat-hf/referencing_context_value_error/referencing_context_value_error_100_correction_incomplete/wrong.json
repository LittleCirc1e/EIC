The second alloy contains 1 part of copper and 7 parts of zinc, so the copper in the second alloy is 1/8. To get equal proportions of copper and zinc in the resultant alloy, we need to mix the two alloys in a ratio that ensures that the total amount of copper is equal to the total amount of zinc.\n\nLet's say we mix the two alloys in a ratio of x:y, where x is the amount of the first alloy and y is the amount of the second alloy. We can set up the following equation:\n\n5x + 3x = 7y + 1y\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n8x = 8y\n\nSince the two alloys have equal proportions of copper and zinc, we know that the ratio of copper to zinc in the resultant alloy is the same as the ratio of copper to zinc in the first alloy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n5x / (5x + 3x) = 1 / 7\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n5/7 = 1/7\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 5/7\n\nTherefore, the resultant alloy contains equal proportions of copper and zinc."
