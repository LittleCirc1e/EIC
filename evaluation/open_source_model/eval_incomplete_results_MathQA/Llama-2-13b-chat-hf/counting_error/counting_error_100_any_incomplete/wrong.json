        "explanation": "In step 2 of the original_solution, the total days are erroneously counted as 6 instead of 7 when calculating the total rainfall for the week. This affects the following steps since the total rainfall is now incorrectly set to 18 cm instead of 21 cm. Consequently, the calculation is based on the wrong total, which also changes the final answer for Tuesday’s rainfall from 10.5 cm to 9 cm.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect.\n\nThe explanation is #2, because the total rainfall for the week is 18 cm, not 3 cm. The solution should be x = 18 cm, not x = 3 cm."

        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 mistakenly changes the percentage of counties with no rain from 25% to 20%, resulting in the inequality changing from 60 + 65 - x = 100 - 25 to 60 + 65 - x = 100 - 20. Consequently, the final answer is affected, and the correct percentage of counties that received rain on both Monday and Tuesday changes from 50% to 45%. The wrong step introduces a single counting error in the problem-solving process, but the arithmetic to solve for x is still carried out correctly after the error.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is correct.\n\nThe explanation is #2. The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that the sum of two or more sets is equal to the sum of the sets minus the intersection of the sets. In this case, the sets are the counties that received rain on Monday and Tuesday, and the intersection is the counties that did not receive rain on either day. By subtracting the intersection from the sum of the sets, we get the correct answer."
