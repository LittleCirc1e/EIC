Therefore, the speed of the train when crossing the 250 m platform is (x + 260) / 20.\n\nThe same logic applies to the second platform of length 640 m. The effective distance of the train when crossing the second platform is 10 m more than the actual distance, which is 640 m + 10 m = 650 m.

        "question": "A number when divided by 6 leaves a remainder 3. When the square of the same number is divided by 6, the remainder is what?",
        "original_solution": "Let the number be x.\nTherefore, x = 6a + 3, where a is the quotient.\nThen x^2 = 36a^2 + 36a + 9 = 6(6a^2 + 6a + 1) + 3, which means when the square of the number is divided by 6, the remainder is 3.\n#### 3",
        "original_answer": 3,
        "transformed_solution": "Let the number be x, and it's given that x when divided by 6 leaves a remainder 3 and there is a penalty of 2 units for drawing numbers on the board.\n",
        "transformed_answer": 1,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "adding_irrelevant_information",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 1 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <and there is a penalty of 2 units for drawing numbers on the board>, resulting in step 1 changing from x = 6a + 3 in the original_solution to x = 6a + 3 - 2 in the transformed_solution. This change affects the calculation of the square of the number and thus the wrong remainder is obtained when divided by 6. It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is correct. The explanation is #2, which is that when x is divided by 6, the remainder is 3, and when x^2 is divided by 6, the remainder is also 3. This is because when a number is divided by 6, the remainder is independent of the number being divided, so the remainder of x when divided by 6 is the same as the remainder of x^2 when divided by 6. Therefore, the solution is correct."

        "question": "A bag contains 3 blue and 5 white marbles. One by one, marbles are drawn out randomly until only two are left in the bag. What is the probability that out of the two, one is white and one is blue?",
        "original_solution": "First, calculate the probability of drawing one white and one blue marble from the bag.\nThe probability of drawing a white marble first is 5/8, and the probability of drawing a blue marble next is 3/7.\nThe probability of drawing a blue marble first is 3/8, and the probability of drawing a white marble next is 5/7.\nAdd the two probabilities together: (5/8 * 3/7) + (3/8 * 5/7) = 15/56 + 15/56 = 30/56 = 15/28\n#### 15/28",
        "original_answer": "15/28",
        "transformed_solution": "First, calculate the probability of drawing one white and one blue marble from the bag, considering there is an additional red marble in the bag making it 3 blue, 5 white, and 1 red marble.\n",
        "transformed_answer": "5/12",
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "adding_irrelevant_information",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 1 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement by supposing there is an additional red marble in the bag, which changes the total number of marbles and affects the probabilities calculated. As a result, the probability calculations in the transformed_solution incorrectly account for the total number of marbles as 9 instead of 8, and thus the answer is altered from 15/28 in the original_solution to 5/12 in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that even though this change affects multiple probabilities calculated later in the solution, it originates from a single point of error in the initial assumption.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is correct. The explanation is #2, which is that the probability of drawing one white and one blue marble from the bag is 3/19, since there are 3 blue and 5 white marbles in the bag, and 1 red marble.\n\nThe solution is correct because the probability of drawing one white marble is 5/19 (5 white marbles out of 19 total marbles), and the probability of drawing one blue marble is 3/19 (3 blue marbles out of 19 total marbles). Therefore, the probability of drawing one white and one blue marble is 5/19 x 3/19 = 3/19."
