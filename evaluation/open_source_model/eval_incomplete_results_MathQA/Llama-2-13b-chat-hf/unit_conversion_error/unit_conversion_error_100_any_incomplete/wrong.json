This incorrect conversion affects the final step 3, changing the speed calculation from 1.44 km / 0.2 hours = 7.2 km/h to 1.8 km / 0.2 hours = 9 km/h. It should be noted that only the unit conversion in step 1 is affected, and all the other steps remain correct.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect.\n\nThe explanation is #1: The conversion from meters to kilometers is incorrect. 1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters, not 800 meters. Therefore, the correct conversion would be: 1440 m * 1 km / 1000 m = 1.8 km.\n\nThe solution should be: 1.8 km/12 minutes = 150 km/h."

According to the given information, the car takes 5 seconds longer to travel 1 km than it would take to travel 1 km at 90 km/hr, so the time taken to travel 1 km at the car's speed is 1/x + 5/3500 hours."

        "question": "Excluding stoppages, the speed of a bus is 54 kmph and including stoppages, it is 36 kmph. For how many minutes does the bus stop per hour?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the time the bus stops per hour.\nAccording to the given information, the distance covered excluding stoppages is the same as that including stoppages. Therefore, the time taken excluding stoppages is less than the time taken including stoppages.\nDistance = speed x time\nThe speed of the bus without stoppages is 54 kmph, and with stoppages is 36 kmph, which means the bus covers 18 km less in an hour when it stops.\nTo find out for how long the bus stops, we calculate the difference in distance traveled: 54 km/h - 36 km/h = 18 km/h difference.\nThis difference of 18 km occurs because the bus is stopping for some time during the hour. To convert this lost distance back into time, we find out the fraction of the hour the bus stoppages take, which is the difference in speed (18 km/h) divided by the original speed (54 km/h).\nThis gives us 18/54 of an hour the bus is stopped. To convert this fraction to minutes, we multiply by 60 minutes/hour.\nThus, the bus stops for (18/54) * 60 minutes per hour = 20 minutes per hour.\n#### 20",
