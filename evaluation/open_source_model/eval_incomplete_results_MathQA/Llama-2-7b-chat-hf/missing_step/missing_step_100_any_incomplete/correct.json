The reference to each part being equivalent to 10 still holds as the calculation method is correct, but since we consider there to be 10 parts of muffins instead of 1, step 2 should be modified to reflect a 1:1 part ratio between doughnuts and muffins. Given there are 50 doughnuts, the calculation changes to 50 x 1 = 50 for the number of muffins, which should ultimately modify the formula to 50 x 1 = 50. It should be noted that the calculation in step 3 maintains the error and refers incorrectly to '10 parts of muffins', as the initial step that created the incorrect carryover effect from the deletion is step 1, thus it is marked as the wrong_step.

However, in the transformed_solution step 3 incorrectly refers to the amount from the question (20 kgs) and references 0.25 directly from the question instead of the correct 0.15 resulting from the step 1 formula (0.15x for the amount of dry grapes in x kgs of fresh grapes) which should be 0.15x = 15, not 0.25x = 15 as the transformed_solution suggests. This results in the transformed_answer being 15 / 0.15 + 5 (weight of water in raisins) = 133.33, a different value from the original_answer 100, due to an incorrect removal of step 2 and incorrect reference in step 3.",

The solution assumes that the weight of fresh grapes needed to produce 20 kgs of raisins is equal to the weight of water in 20 kgs of raisins, which is not true. The weight of fresh grapes needed to produce 20 kgs of raisins is actually less than the weight of water in 20 kgs of raisins, because the drying process removes water from the grapes. Therefore, the correct calculation is:\n\nWeight of fresh grapes needed = 20 kgs / (0.85 x weight of fresh grapes) = 24 kgs\n\nSo, 24 kgs of fresh grapes are needed to produce 20 kgs of raisins."

As a result, the subtraction operation in step 4 is incorrect, but it still reveals that the equation 2x - 780 = 2x + 780 cannot hold true unless the extra bananas (780) is balanced out by an equal amount on the other side of the equation (-780 = 780). Hence, in step 5, instead of equating -780 to 390, it should equate -780 to 780 to maintain this balance.
