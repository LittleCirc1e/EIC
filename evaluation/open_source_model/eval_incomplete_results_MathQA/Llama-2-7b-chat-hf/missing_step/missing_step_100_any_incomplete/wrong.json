Therefore, after deleting step 2, step 3 should reference the initial assumption and then the formula changes. Step 3 is modified from n(n+1)(n+2) = 990 to n(n+2) = 990, which simplifies the product without considering the middle number (n+1). Steps after the modified step 3 are then altered to reflect this simplification, which leads to an incorrect result that two of the consecutive numbers are 30 and 31, providing a sum of 61.

However, instead of directly using the speed in km/hr (which would be incorrect as the units must match), the speed is mistakenly changed to 72 m/s (a much higher speed), which results in an incorrect conversion and impacts the formula in step 2. This change wrongly modifies the original formula \"280 m / 20 m/s\" to \"280 m / 72 m/s,\" resulting in an incorrect time calculation of 3.89 seconds.

Therefore, after deleting step 4, step 5 directly attempts to use the elimination method incorrectly without establishing the proper equation from the relationship of legs and heads; it incorrectly concludes that 2p can be canceled out from both sides without considering the dogs' count, leading us to a nonsensical simplification 0 = 28, which implies that the system of equations has no solution.
