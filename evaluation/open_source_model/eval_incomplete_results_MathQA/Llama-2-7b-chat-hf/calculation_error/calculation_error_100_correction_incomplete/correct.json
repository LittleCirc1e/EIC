        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is:\n\nThe rate of interest per annum is 7.2%.\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution is incorrect because it does not consider the compounding period correctly. The compounding period is 2 years, so the interest should be calculated for 2 years. The formula for compound interest is:\n\nA = P x (1 + r)^n\n\nWhere A is the future value, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest per annum, and n is the number of years.\n\nIn this case, the principal amount is $20,000, the rate of interest per annum is 7.2%, and the number of years is 2. Therefore, the future value can be calculated as:\n\nA = $20,000 x (1 + 0.072)^2 = $20,000 x 1.092 = $21,800\n\nSo, the rate of interest per annum is 7.2%."
