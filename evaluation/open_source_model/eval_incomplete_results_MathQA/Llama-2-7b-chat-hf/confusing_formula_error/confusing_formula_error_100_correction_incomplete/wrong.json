        "question": "A rectangular field has a length 10 meters more than its width. If the area of the field is 144, what is the length (in meters) of the rectangular field?",
        "original_solution": "Let the width be x meters\nThen the length is x+10 meters\nThe area of the field is given by length * width = (x+10)*x = 144\nExpanding the equation, we get x^2 + 10x - 144 = 0\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get x = (-10 + sqrt(10^2 - 4*1*(-144)))/2*1 = (-10 + 26)/2 = 16/2 = 8\nSo the width is 8 meters\nAnd the length is 8+10=18 meters\n#### 18",
        "original_answer": 18.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let the width be x meters\nThen the length is x+10 meters\nThe perimeter of the field is given by 2*(length + width) = 2*((x+10) + x) = 144\n",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by the width. However, the transformed solution replaces the formula for area with the formula for perimeter, resulting in an incorrect expansion of 2*((x+10) + x) = 144 instead of (x+10)*x = 144. This affects the subsequent related steps, changing the quadratics and their resolution to a linear equation and its resolution. Note that the language description of step 3 < The area of the field is given by > remains unchanged in the transformed_solution as < The perimeter of the field is given by >, causing the mistake by changing the formula used without modifying the descriptive text. It should be also noted that the only error occurs in step 3, and the initial steps and definitions remain correct.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is:\nThe solution is correct because it uses the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is 2(length + width). The solution correctly identifies the length as x+10 and the width as x, and then uses these values to calculate the perimeter correctly.\n\nIf the solution were incorrect, the error would likely occur in step 3, where the solution multiplies the length and width to find the perimeter. The error would be that the solution mistakenly multiplies the length and width instead of adding them, resulting in a incorrect calculation of the perimeter."
