        "original_solution": "Let t be the time in minutes after the gears start rotating.\nAfter t minutes, gear p will have made 10t revolutions and gear q will have made 40t revolutions.\nWe need to find t such that 40t = 10t + 5\nSolving for t: 30t = 5, t = 5/30 = 1/6\nIn seconds, 1/6 minutes is 1/6 * 60 = 10 seconds.\n#### 10",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 4 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 minute is wrongly equal to 50 seconds instead of 60 seconds, resulting in 1/6 * 60 = 10 seconds in the original_solution becoming 1/6 * 50 = 8.33 seconds in the transformed_solution. The error only affects the unit conversion for representing minutes into seconds and does not affect the algebraic operation or the process to find t, as that remains correct.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. The solution correctly determines the time at which gear q will make 5 more revolutions than gear p. The explanation is that the ratio of the speeds of gears p and q is 10:40, which means that for every 10 revolutions made by gear p, gear q will make 40 revolutions. Therefore, after t minutes, gear p will have made 10t revolutions, and gear q will have made 40t revolutions. To find the time at which gear q will make 5 more revolutions than gear p, we need to solve the equation 40t = 10t + 5, which gives us t = 1/6."
