        "original_solution": "The old machine makes 100 bolts per hour and the new machine makes 150 bolts per hour.\nTogether, they make 100 bolts/hour + 150 bolts/hour = 250 bolts per hour.\nTo make a total of 500 bolts, it will take 500 bolts / 250 bolts/hour = 2 hours.\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so it will take 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes for the two machines to make a total of 500 bolts.\n#### 120",
        "original_answer": 120,
        "transformed_solution": "The old machine makes 100 bolts per hour and the new machine makes 150 bolts per hour.\nTogether, they make 100 bolts/hour + 150 bolts/hour = 250 bolts per hour.\nTo make a total of 500 bolts, it will take 500 bolts / 250 bolts/hour = 2 hours.\nThere are 50 minutes in an hour, so it will take 2 hours * 50 minutes/hour = 100 minutes for the two machines to make a total of 500 bolts.\n",

        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 4 makes an incorrect unit conversion, which erroneously suggests there are 50 minutes in an hour instead of 60 minutes, resulting in 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes in the original_solution becoming 2 hours * 50 minutes/hour = 100 minutes in the transformed_solution. This changes the original_answer from 120 minutes to 100 minutes, introducing a unit conversion error. The error is isolated to just this single wrong step, while the other steps' computations remain correct.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. The explanation is that the total rate at which the two machines produce bolts is 250 bolts per hour, which means it will take 2 hours to produce 500 bolts."
