This change affects the calculation in step 3, resulting in the number of trucks that could have been rented out and returned by Saturday being calculated as 10 * 2 = 20. Subsequently, step 4 incorrectly concludes that at most 20 different trucks could have been rented out over the week, rather than the original 24. The modification maintains the logic of 50% of the trucks being returned, but the initial condition about the number of trucks on the lot on Saturday has been incorrectly altered.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #. The solution states that if at least 14 trucks were on the lot on Saturday, then at most 10 trucks were rented out. However, this is not the correct answer.

In fact, the number of trucks rented out during the week is equal to 14, since 14 trucks were on the lot on Saturday morning. Therefore, the solution is incorrect."
