        "explanation": "Here, step 1 erroneously counts the number of workdays as 4 instead of 5, excluding one of the 8-hour workdays. This alteration changes the total hours worked in the week from 36 to 28, leading to an incorrect calculation of the hourly wage in the later step, which changes from $396 / 36 hours = $11 per hour to $396 / 28 hours = $14.14 per hour. It should be noted that only the first step contains a counting error, and subsequent calculations are based on this mistake; however, these calculations are performed correctly based on the altered inputs.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #.\n\nExplanation: The solution is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that Sheila does not work on Saturday and Sunday. Therefore, the total hours worked from Monday through Friday is not 28 hours. The correct answer is 22 hours."

        "question": "In a particular state, 60% of the counties received some rain on Monday, and 65% of the counties received some rain on Tuesday. No rain fell either day in 25% of the counties in the state. What percent of the counties received some rain on Monday and Tuesday?",
        "original_solution": "Let x be the percent of counties that received rain on both Monday and Tuesday\nThen, 60 + 65 - x = 100 - 25  (Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion)\n125 - x = 75 \n-x = -50 \nx = 50\n#### 50%",

        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 mistakenly changes the percentage of counties with no rain from 25% to 20%, resulting in the inequality changing from 60 + 65 - x = 100 - 25 to 60 + 65 - x = 100 - 20. Consequently, the final answer is affected, and the correct percentage of counties that received rain on both Monday and Tuesday changes from 50% to 45%. The wrong step introduces a single counting error in the problem-solving process, but the arithmetic to solve for x is still carried out correctly after the error.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #.\n\nThe solution is incorrect because there is an error in step 3. The formula used is incorrect, it should be 60 + 65 - x = 100 - 20, not 60 + 65 - x = 100 - 20. The correct answer is 40%."
