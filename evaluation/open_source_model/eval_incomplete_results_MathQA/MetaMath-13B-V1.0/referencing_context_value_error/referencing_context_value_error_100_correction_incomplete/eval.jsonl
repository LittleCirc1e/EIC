Time = 500 m / 15 m/s = 33.33 seconds.\n#### 33.33", "original_answer": 33.33, "transformed_solution": "First, we need to convert the speed from km/hr to m/s. 50 km/hr = 50 x 1000 / 3600 = 13.89 m/s.\n", "transformed_answer": 36.01, "wrong_step": 1, "wrong_type": "referencing_context_value_error", "is_single_error": true, "explanation": "Step 1 references 54 km/hr in the question as 50 km/hr wrongly, and calculates 50 x 1000 / 3600 = 13.89 m/s instead of 54 x 1000 / 3600 = 15 m/s. Its subsequent related step will be affected, calculating the time as 500 m / 13.89 m/s = 36.01 seconds instead of 500 m / 15 m/s = 33.33 seconds in step 3. Please note that you should only consider one error, so step 2 still references 360 m and 140 m in the question correctly.", "eval_result": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for the train to pass the bridge.\nWe know that the train is 360 m long and the bridge is 140 m long.\nThe speed of the train is 13.89 m/s.\nTo find the time it takes for the train to pass the bridge, we can use the formula:\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nLet's calculate the time:\nTime = 140 m / 13.89 m/s\nTime = 10.87 s\n\nSince the time is in seconds, we need to convert it to hours by dividing by 60 and then by 60 again:\nTime = 10.87 s / 60\nTime = 0.18125 h\nTime = 1.75 min\n\nTherefore, it will take 1.75 minutes for the train to pass the bridge.\n\nThe answer is: 1.75"}
