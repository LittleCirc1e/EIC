        "eval_result": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the volume of a similar cube that is twice as long, twice as wide, and twice as high as the original cube.\n\nThe original volume of the cube is 3*x*x=64, where x is the side length.\n\nFor the similar cube, the side length is twice as long, twice as wide, and twice as high as the original cube. Therefore, the side length of the similar cube is 2*x.\n\nThe volume of the similar cube is 3*(2*x)*(2*x)*2*x=36*x^3.\n\nWe are given that the volume of the original cube is 64 cubic feet. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n36*x^3=64\n\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 36:\n\nx^3=2\n\nTo solve for x, we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\nx=2^(1/3)\n\nThe value of x is 2^(1/3).\n\nTherefore, the volume of the similar cube is 36*x^3=36*(2^(1/3))^3=36*2^3=36*8=288 cubic feet.\n\nThe solution is: 288"
