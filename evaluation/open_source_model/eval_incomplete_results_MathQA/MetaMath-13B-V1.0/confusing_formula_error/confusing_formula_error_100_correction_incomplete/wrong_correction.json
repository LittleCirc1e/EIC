        "question": "A cistern 4 m long and 2 m wide contains water up to a depth of 1 m 25 cm. The total area of the wet surface is:",
        "original_solution": "The wet surface area includes the bottom and all four sides of the cistern.\nThe bottom surface area is 4*2=8 square meters\nThe wet side surface area is (4*1.25)*2 + (2*1.25)*2 = 10 + 5 = 15 square meters\nSo the total wet surface area is 8 + 15 = 23 square meters\n#### 23",
        "original_answer": 23.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The wet surface area includes the bottom and all four sides of the cistern.\nThe bottom surface area is 4*2=8 square meters\n",
        "transformed_answer": 25.0,
        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the area of the side surface of the cistern with its perimeter. The question requires that the side surface area be calculated as length*height for one side, and width*height for the adjacent side. This was done correctly in the original solution as (4*1.25)*2 + (2*1.25)*2 for the two pairs of sides. However, in the transformed_solution, the calculation erroneously changed to the sum of the lengths of each side, which is equivalent to calculating the perimeter of the sides submerged in water, resulting in (4+1.25)*2 + (2+1.25)*2 in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent addition of areas for total wet surface calculation, changing the total from 8 + 15 = 23 square meters to 8 + 17 = 25 square meters. The language description in step 2, < The wet side surface area is >, from the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. Only the formula in step 2 was confused; all other steps use the correct formula for calculating areas.",
        "eval_result": "The sides of the cistern have a length of 4 meters and a width of 2 meters, so the total surface area of the sides is 4*2+4*2=16 square meters\n.\n\nThe total wet surface area is the sum of the bottom surface area and the side surface area, so it is 8+16=24 square meters\n.\n\nHowever, the given answer is 25 square meters, which means there is an error in the solution. Therefore, the solution is incorrect, and we need to find the correct answer.\n\nTo find the correct answer, we need to determine the actual depth of the water in the cistern. The given depth is 1 meter and 25 centimeters, which is equivalent to 1.25 meters.\n\nThe volume of the water in the cistern can be calculated using the formula: volume = length * width * depth.\n\nThe volume is 4 meters * 2 meters * 1.25 meters = 9 square meters.\n\nThe total surface area of the wet surface, including the bottom and all four sides, is equal to the volume of the water. Therefore, the correct answer is 9 square meters.\n\nThe solution is incorrect, and the correct answer is 9.The answer is: 9"
