As a result, the probability calculations in the transformed_solution incorrectly account for the total number of marbles as 9 instead of 8, and thus the answer is altered from 15/28 in the original_solution to 5/12 in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that even though this change affects multiple probabilities calculated later in the solution, it originates from a single point of error in the initial assumption.", "eval_result": "The probability of drawing a white marble on the first draw is 5/8, and the probability of drawing a blue marble on the second draw is 2/6. The probability of drawing a blue marble on the first draw is 2/6, and the probability of drawing a white marble on the second draw is 1/2.\n.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing one white and one blue marble is (5/8) * (2/6) + (2/6) * (1/2) = 10/48 + 6/48 = 16/48 = 1/3.\n.\n\nSince there is only one red marble left in the bag, the probability of drawing a red marble on the third draw is 1/1. Therefore, the probability of drawing one white and one blue marble and then drawing a red marble is (1/3) * (1/1) = 1/3.\n.\n\nTherefore, the probability that out of the two marbles left in the bag, one is white and one is blue is 1/3.\n.\n\nThe answer is: 3"}
