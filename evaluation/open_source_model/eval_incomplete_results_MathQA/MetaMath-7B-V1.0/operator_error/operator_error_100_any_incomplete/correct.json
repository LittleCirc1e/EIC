        "question": "A baseball card decreased in value 20% in its first year and 10% in its second year. What was the total percent decrease of the card's value over the two years?",
        "original_solution": "The total decrease percentage is 28% because 100 - ((100 - 20) * (100 - 10) / 100) = 28\n#### 28",
        "original_answer": 28.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total decrease percentage is 32% because 100 - ((100 - 20) / (100 - 10) * 100) = 32\n",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this example, the division in step 1 was transformed into a multiplication, so instead of dividing by the percentage after the second decrease, it multiplies, which leads to an incorrect percentage decrease calculation. Specifically, ((100 - 20) * (100 - 10) / 100) was changed to ((100 - 20) / (100 - 10) * 100). The calculation of the result is then carried out correctly, but since it's based on the wrong operator, the final transformed_answer is incorrect while being different from the original_answer.",
        "eval_result": "To determine the total percent decrease of the card's value over the two years, we need to calculate the decrease percentage for each year and then add them together.\n\nThe decrease percentage for the first year is 20%.\nThe decrease percentage for the second year is 10%.\n\nTo calculate the total decrease percentage, we add the decrease percentages for each year:\n\n20% + 10% = 30%\n\nTherefore, the total percent decrease of the card's value over the two years is 30%.\n\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is: The solution is incorrect because it does not account for the compounding effect of the decreases. The total decrease percentage would be 32% if calculated correctly.The answer is: 32"

        "explanation": "In this example, the addition in step 2 of the original solution (4 + 4 + 4 = 12) is incorrectly changed to multiplication, resulting in 4 * 4 * 4 = 64. This results in an incorrect number of favorable outcomes, which affects the probability calculation in step 4. The subsequent calculation in step 4 uses the incorrect number of favorable outcomes, but the division itself is computed correctly. However, since the number of favorable outcomes has changed, the final answer is different from the original answer and incorrect due to the operator error introduced.",
