        "original_solution": "First, we need to convert 5 minutes to hours, so 5 minutes = 5/60 hours = 1/12 hours.\nThe speed is calculated as distance/time, so the speed is 600 meters / (1/12) hours = 600 x 12 = 7200 meters/hour.\nTo convert meters to kilometers, we divide the speed by 1000, so 7200 meters/hour = 7200/1000 = 7.2 km/hour.\n#### 7.2",

        "transformed_solution": "The speed is calculated as distance/time, so the speed is 600 meters / (1/12) hours = 600 x 12 = 7200 meters/hour.\nTo convert meters to kilometers, we divide the speed by 1000, so 7200 meters/hour = 7200/1000 = 7.2 km/hour.\nSo the speed is 7.2*60/5 = 86.4 km/hour.\n",

        "explanation": "In this example, step 1 which converts 5 minutes to hours (1/12) is removed. In the original_solution, step 2 references the result (1/12 hours) from step 1, so after deleting step 1, the numbers from step 1 are still used in step 2 of the transformed_solution incorrectly. What should have happened is that instead of referencing (1/12), step 2's calculation should've been adjusted to refer to the original value from the question, which is 5 minutes, but is instead left unchanged which results in an incorrect interpretation of the units and an incorrect answer. Step 3 in the transformed_solution becomes the incorrect step as it attempts to recalculate the speed, multiplying by an incorrect scale factor of 60/5 that doesn't correspond to any conversion process in this context. This extra, unrelated step is what leads to the incorrect answer. Therefore, the wrong_step is 3.",
        "eval_result": "To determine if the solution is correct, we need to compare it to the given information.\nThe man crosses a 600 m long street in 5 minutes.\nTo calculate the speed, we divide the distance by the time: 600 m / 5 minutes = 120 km/hour.\nThe solution states that the speed is 86.4 km/hour.\nSince the solution is incorrect, we can format our response as:\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is: The speed calculated in the solution is incorrect. The correct speed is 120 km/hour.\n#### 120\nThe answer is: 120"

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 has been removed. In the original_solution, step 1 assigns a variable x to the number we are looking for. Step 2 constructs an equation based on the question. After deleting step 1, step 2 should change the equation to directly equate to 0, because without defining the variable x or giving it a proper equation, the solution should simplify the equation directly to zero for solving. This leads to a change in Step 2 from '15x + 196 = x' to '15x + 196 = 0'. Subsequent steps are then adjusted to solve the new equation, and step 3 changes from 'Subtract x from both sides: 14x + 196 = 0' to 'Subtract 196 from both sides: 15x = -196'. The following steps solve for x accordingly. The wrong_step is 1 in the transformed_solution, which corresponds to the adjusted step 2 in the original_solution, because it's the first step that references an incorrect equality relationship due to the deletion of the variable assignment to x.",

The last steps calculate the individual numbers based on this newly solved x, however, the calculation for 4x = 24 has been omitted. The transformed solution no longer includes the number 24, reflecting the product of 4x, hence the transformed answer is [18, 42] which is different from the original answer.
