        "original_solution": "The current quantity of milk in the mixture is 2/(2+1) * 60 = 40 liters\nThe current quantity of water in the mixture is 1/(2+1) * 60 = 20 liters\nLet the quantity of water to be further added be x\nThe new total quantity of water in the mixture will be 20 + x\nThe new total quantity of milk in the mixture will be 40 liters\nThe new ratio of milk and water is 40 : (20 + x), and as per the given ratio, we have 40/(20 + x) = 1/2\n40 = (20 + x)/2\n80 = 20 + x\n60 = x\n#### 60",
        "original_answer": 60.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The current quantity of milk in the mixture is 2/(2+1) * 60 = 40 liters\nThe current quantity of water in the mixture is 1/(2+1) * 60 = 20 liters\nLet the quantity of water to be further added be x\nAssuming there is an additional 5 liter loss due to evaporation, the new total quantity of water in the mixture including evaporation loss will be 20 + x - 5\n",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 4 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <Assuming there is an additional 5 liter loss due to evaporation>, resulting in step 4 changing from The new total quantity of water in the mixture will be 20 + x in the original_solution to The new total quantity of water in the mixture including evaporation loss will be 20 + x - 5 in the transformed_solution. This change affects the subsequent calculations, where the new equation to solve for x becomes 40 = (20 + x - 5)/2 and leads to x being 65 instead of the original answer of 60.",
        "eval_result": "To determine if the [Solution] is correct, we need to check if the given answer is correct.\nThe given answer is 30, which means the quantity of water to be further added is 30 - 20 = 10 liters.\nTherefore, the [Solution] is incorrect, and the correct answer is 30.\nThe explanation is: The solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 30, and the explanation is that the quantity of water to be further added is 10 liters."
