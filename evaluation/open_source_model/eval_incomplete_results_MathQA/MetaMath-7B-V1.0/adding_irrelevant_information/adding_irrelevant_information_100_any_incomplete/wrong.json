        "question": "A bag contains 3 blue and 5 white marbles. One by one, marbles are drawn out randomly until only two are left in the bag. What is the probability that out of the two, one is white and one is blue?",
        "original_solution": "First, calculate the probability of drawing one white and one blue marble from the bag.\nThe probability of drawing a white marble first is 5/8, and the probability of drawing a blue marble next is 3/7.\nThe probability of drawing a blue marble first is 3/8, and the probability of drawing a white marble next is 5/7.\nAdd the two probabilities together: (5/8 * 3/7) + (3/8 * 5/7) = 15/56 + 15/56 = 30/56 = 15/28\n#### 15/28",
        "original_answer": "15/28",
        "transformed_solution": "First, calculate the probability of drawing one white and one blue marble from the bag, considering there is an additional red marble in the bag making it 3 blue, 5 white, and 1 red marble.\n",
        "transformed_answer": "5/12",
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "adding_irrelevant_information",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 1 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement by supposing there is an additional red marble in the bag, which changes the total number of marbles and affects the probabilities calculated. As a result, the probability calculations in the transformed_solution incorrectly account for the total number of marbles as 9 instead of 8, and thus the answer is altered from 15/28 in the original_solution to 5/12 in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that even though this change affects multiple probabilities calculated later in the solution, it originates from a single point of error in the initial assumption.",
        "eval_result": "The total number of marbles in the bag is 3 blue + 5 white + 1 red = 9 marbles.\nThe probability of drawing one white and one blue marble is the number of favorable outcomes (1 white, 1 blue) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (all possible pairs of marbles).\n\nTo calculate the number of favorable outcomes, we need to consider that the first marble drawn can be either white or blue, and the second marble drawn must be the opposite color. So, there are 3 choices for the first marble and 2 choices for the second marble, giving us a total of 3 * 2 = 6 favorable outcomes.\n\nTo calculate the total number of possible outcomes, we need to consider that there are 9 marbles in total, so there are 9 * 8 = 72 possible pairs of marbles.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing one white and one blue marble is 6 favorable outcomes / 72 possible outcomes = 1/12.\n\nThe answer is: 1/12"
