        "question": "sheila works 8 hours per day on monday , wednesday and friday , and 6 hours per day on tuesday and thursday . she does not work on saturday and sunday . she earns $ 468 per week . how much does she earn in dollars per hour ?",
        "original_solution": "Total hours worked in a week = (8 * 3) + (6 * 2) = 24 + 12 = 36 hours\nShe earns $468 per week\nEarning per hour = 468 / 36\n#### 13",
        "original_answer": 13.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Total hours worked in a week = (8 * 2) + (6 * 2) = 16 + 12 = 28 hours\n",
        "transformed_answer": 16.7142857143,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 erroneously counts Monday, Wednesday, and Friday as 2 days each instead of 3, reducing the total worked hours from (8 * 3) to (8 * 2). This counting error affects only the calculation related to the total hours worked (step 1) and subsequently changes the earning per hour computation (step 3) from 468 / 36 = 13 to 468 / 28 = 16.7142857143. It should be noted that the counting error should only be at one place, and the other calculation processes after the count alteration stay correct.",
        "eval_result": "To determine the correctness of the [Solution], we need to compare the total hours worked in a week (28 hours) with the number of hours Sheila works per day.\nFrom the given information, we can see that Sheila works a total of 8 hours on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and 6 hours on Tuesday and Thursday.\nTherefore, the total number of hours Sheila works in a week is 8 + 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 40 hours.\nSince the total hours worked in a week is equal to 28 hours, we can conclude that the [Solution] is incorrect.\nThe correct [Solution] would be: The solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #.\nTherefore, the value of the unknown variable x is incorrect.The answer is: 28"
