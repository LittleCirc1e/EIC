        "explanation": "Step 1 references 60 in the question as 50 wrongly, and calculates 2/(2+1) * 50 = 33.33 liters instead of 2/(2+1) * 60 = 40 liters. The erroneous result 33.33 liters will continue to impact the subsequent related steps, but each of those steps are calculated correctly based on the incorrect reference. Step 2 references 50 as well and calculates 1/(2+1) * 50 = 16.66 liters incorrectly. This error will lead to a transformed_answer of 50, which is different from the original_answer of 60. Please note that despite the errors pointed out in step 2, the wrong_step is step 1, as it introduces the incorrect reference and all other steps are correct based on the result from step 1.",
        "eval_result": "To determine the quantity of water to be further added, we need to find the difference between the desired ratio and the current ratio.\nThe desired ratio is 1:2, which means for every 1 part of milk, there are 2 parts of water.\nThe current ratio is 2:1, which means for every 2 parts of milk, there is 1 part of water.\nTo find the difference, we subtract the current ratio from the desired ratio:\n1 - 2 = -1\nThis means that there is a difference of 1 part between the desired and current ratios.\n\nSince the current ratio is 2 parts of milk to 1 part of water, we need to add 1 part of water for every 2 parts of milk.\nTo find the quantity of water to be further added, we multiply the number of parts of milk by the ratio of water to milk:\n33.33 liters * (1/2) = 16.67 liters\n\nTherefore, the quantity of water to be further added is 16.67 liters.\n\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is: The desired ratio is 1:2, which means for every 1 part of milk, there are 2 parts of water. The current ratio is 2:1, which means for every 2 parts of milk, there is 1 part of water. To find the difference, we subtract the current ratio from the desired ratio: 1 - 2 = -1. This means that there is a difference of 1 part between the desired and current ratios. Since the current ratio is 2 parts of milk to 1 part of water, we need to add 1 part of water for every 2 parts of milk. To find the quantity of water to be further added, we multiply the number of parts of milk by the ratio of water to milk: 33.33 liters * (1/2) = 16.67 liters. Therefore, the quantity of water to be further added is 16.67 liters. The solution is incorrect, and the explanation is: 16.67 liters.The answer is: 16.67"
