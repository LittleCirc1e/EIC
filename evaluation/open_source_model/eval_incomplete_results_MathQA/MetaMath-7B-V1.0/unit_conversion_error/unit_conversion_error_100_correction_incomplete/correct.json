        "original_solution": "First, start both hourglasses together and let them run.\nWhen the 7 mins hourglass runs out, flip it over immediately.\nWhen the 11 mins hourglass runs out, flip it over immediately.\nWhen the 7 mins hourglass runs out for the second time, 11 + (7 - 7) = 11 + 0 = 11 minutes have passed since you started both hourglasses. So, 11 minutes are over.\n11 minutes + 4 minutes = 15 minutes have passed since you started both hourglasses.\n#### 15",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In the transformed_solution, incorrect unit conversion is applied by changing the time passed after both hourglasses have been flipped to 10 minutes instead of 11. This changes the calculation in step 4, which previously added up to 11 minutes and now incorrectly sums to 10 minutes. As a result, the total time in the final step is now 14 minutes, which is incorrect. Only one step of unit conversion error is considered, and the error is synchronized through the subsequent related steps without affecting the previous or unrelated steps.",
