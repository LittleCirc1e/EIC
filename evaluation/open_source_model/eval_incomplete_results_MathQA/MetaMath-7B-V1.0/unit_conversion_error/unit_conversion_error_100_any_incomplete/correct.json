Since the population increase rate per 15 seconds remains constant, the rest of the calculations need to maintain a logical flow. This unit conversion error improperly reduces the total number of seconds counted in the hour, leading to a decrease in the calculated population increase. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, and the calculation of the rate of population increase per time unit is still correctly based on the incorrect conversion.",
        "eval_result": "The solution is incorrect, and the explanation is: The population increases by 200 persons in 60 minutes. However, the question asks for the number of steps in the solution, not the number of persons. Each step represents a person, so the number of steps in the solution is 200.The answer is: 200"
