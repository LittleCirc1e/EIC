        "question": "the sale price of sarees listed for rs. 400 after successive discount is 20% and 5% is?",
        "original_solution": "First, find the amount of the first discount: 400 * 0.20 = 80\nSubtract the first discount from the original price: 400 - 80 = 320\nThen, find the amount of the second discount: 320 * 0.05 = 16\nSubtract the second discount from the first discounted price: 320 - 16 = 304\n#### 304",
        "original_answer": 304.0,
        "transformed_solution": "First, find the amount of the first discount: 400 * 0.20 = 80\nSubtract the first discount from the original price: 400 - 80 = 320\nThen, find the amount of the second discount: 320 * 0.05 = 15\n",

        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, step 3 has a calculation error where the original 320 * 0.05 = 16 is modified to 320 * 0.05 = 15. This wrong calculation in step 3 changes the correct amount of the second discount, and consequently, the following step 4 inherits this error, altering the subtraction to 320 - 15 = 305. Steps before the wrong step, such as 1 and 2, remain unaffected. The subsequent steps related to the wrong step have a single calculation error, and the final transformed answer has been revised to 305, differing from the original answer.",
        "eval_result": "The solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 320, and the explanation is 15."
