        "question": "Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden. The wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long. How many pieces did she obtain?",
        "original_solution": "If Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long, since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches was 12*4=48 inches.\nSince the wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long, Tracy obtained 48/6=8 pieces\n#### 8",
        "original_answer": 8.0,
        "transformed_solution": "If Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long, since 1 foot is equal to 10 inches, the total length of the wire in inches was 10*4=40 inches.\n",
        "transformed_answer": 6.67,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 foot is wrongly equal to 10 inches instead of 12 inches, resulting in 12*4=48 inches in the original_solution becoming 10*4=40 inches in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 2, which changes from 48/6=8 pieces to 40/6=6.67 pieces. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",
        "eval_result": "The solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 40, and the explanation is as follows: The total length of the wire in inches was 40 inches. Since the wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long, the number of pieces obtained is 40/6=6.67. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a piece, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Tracy obtained 6 pieces. The answer is: 6"
