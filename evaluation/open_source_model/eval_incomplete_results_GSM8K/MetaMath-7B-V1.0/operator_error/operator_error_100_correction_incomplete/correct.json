        "question": "Lucille made an agreement with her mom that she would earn six cents for every weed she pulled in her mom's garden. There are eleven weeds in the flower bed, fourteen in the vegetable patch, and thirty-two in the grass around the fruit trees. Lucille weeded the flower bed, the vegetable patch, and half the grass before she took a break. She bought a soda for 99 cents on her break with some of her earnings. How many cents does Lucille have left?",
        "original_solution": "Lucille weeded half the grass, so she pulled 32 / 2 = 16 weeds around the fruit frees.\nShe pulled 11 + 14 + 16 = 41 weeds before her break.\nFrom that, she earned 41 * 6 = 246 cents.\nAfter buying her soda, Lucille has 246 - 99 = 147 cents left.\n#### 147",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example changes the subtraction operator to division when calculating the remaining money after buying the soda, changing 246 - 99 = 147 to 246 / 99 = 2. The original statement calculates the money left by subtracting the cost of the soda from the total earnings. By using division instead, the process implies dividing the total earnings by the cost of the soda, which generates an incorrect result for this context. The error affects only the final step, and all calculations are performed correctly by applying the changed operator. The rest of the steps before this wrong step are correctly calculated, which means their subsequent reliance on previous steps is fitting. The transformed answer of 2 is incorrect in the context of the question.",

        "question": "Trevor and Joe were working together to finish a 500 piece puzzle. They put the border together first and that was 75 pieces. Trevor was able to place 105 pieces of the puzzle. Joe was able to place three times the number of puzzle pieces as Trevor. How many puzzle pieces are missing?",
        "original_solution": "The puzzle is 500 pieces and the border used 75 pieces so 500-75 = 425 pieces left\nJoe placed three times as many puzzle pieces as Trevor who placed 105 so Joe placed 3*105=315 pieces\nTogether Joe and Trevor placed 315+105 pieces for a total of 420 pieces\nWith the border down that left 425 pieces left and they put down 420 pieces so that meant 425-420 = 5 pieces were missing\n#### 5",
        "original_answer": 5.0,

        "explanation": "This example turns the subtraction in step 1 into addition, and by changing - to +, 500-75 = 425 becomes 500+75 = 575. This affects the subsequent related step 4. Step 4 changes from 425-420 = 5 pieces missing to 575-420 = 155 pieces missing. It should be noted that only the operator in step 1 was incorrect, but its calculation is correct, which leads to its result being incorrect. This affects only the final step of using its result, but all other calculation steps are correct.",
        "eval_result": "The solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 575, and the explanation is as follows:\nThe puzzle is 500 pieces and the border used 75 pieces, so there are 500 - 75 = 425 pieces left.\nTrevor was able to place 105 pieces of the puzzle, so there are 425 - 105 = 320 pieces left.\nJoe was able to place three times the number of puzzle pieces as Trevor, so Joe placed 3 * 105 = 315 pieces of the puzzle.\nTherefore, there are 320 - 315 = 5 puzzle pieces missing.\n#### 5\nThe answer is: 5"
