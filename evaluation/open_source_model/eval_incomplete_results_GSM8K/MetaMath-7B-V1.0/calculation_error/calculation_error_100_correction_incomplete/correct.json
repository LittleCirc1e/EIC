        "question": "Philip is a painter. He makes 2 paintings per day. If he already has 20 paintings, how many paintings in total will he have after 30 days?",
        "original_solution": "The number of paintings Philip will make after 30 days is 2 paints/day * 30 days = 60 paintings.\nThen, the total number of his paintings will be 60 paintings + 20 paintings = 80 paintings.\n#### 80",
        "original_answer": 80.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The number of paintings Philip will make after 30 days is 2 paints/day * 30 days = 50 paintings.\n",
        "transformed_answer": 70.0,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The transformed_solution applies a calculation error in step 1, changing the correct calculation of 2 paints/day * 30 days = 60 paintings to an incorrect 2 paints/day * 30 days = 50 paintings. Subsequent steps are only affected by the error from step 1. Step 2 correctly uses the result from the incorrect step 1, thus adding 50 paintings + 20 paintings to get 70 paintings. No other steps are modified as this is a single-step error, and no operators or operands change in the formulas.",
        "eval_result": "The solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 60, and the explanation is 50.The answer is: 50"

        "question": "Timmy's parents have a 2 car garage, which has both cars inside it.  Also inside is a riding lawnmower, a bicycle for Timmy as well as each of his parents, a tricycle for Timmy's little brother Joey, and a unicycle that Timmy's dad practices riding on.  How many wheels in total are in this garage?",
        "original_solution": "Each car in the garage has 4 wheels, for a total of 4*2=8 wheels.\nThe riding lawnmower has 4 wheels, bringing the total up to 8+4=12 wheels.\nThe bicycles have 2 wheels each and there are 3 of them, for 3*2=6 wheels, bringing the total to 12+6= 18.\nThe tricycle has 3 wheels, and the unicycle has 1 wheel, bringing the total up to 18+1+3= 22 wheels\n#### 22",
        "original_answer": 22,
        "transformed_solution": "Each car in the garage has 4 wheels, for a total of 4*2=8 wheels.\nThe riding lawnmower has 4 wheels, bringing the total up to 8+4=12 wheels.\nThe bicycles have 2 wheels each and there are 3 of them, for 3*2=6 wheels, bringing the total to 12+6= 18.\nThe tricycle has 3 wheels, and the unicycle has 1 wheel, bringing the total up to 18+3+1= 20 wheels\n",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example incorrectly adds up the tricycle and unicycle wheels in step 4 as 18+3+1=20 wheels instead of 18+1+3=22 wheels. The error made at this step changed the final total number of wheels. The earlier steps remain unaffected since they are correct and unrelated to the error in step 4.",
