        "explanation": "The transformation process includes a wrong calculation in step 2 where the sum is mistakenly changed from \"24+4 = 28 candles\" to an incorrect \"24+4 = 20 candles\". This directly affects the outcome in step 3, where the incorrect total of 20 candles is divided between the two people instead of the correct total of 28 candles. The result of this miscalculation is that each person is incorrectly calculated to get \"20/2 = 10 birthday candles\" instead of the correct answer of \"14 birthday candles\". This exemplifies a single step calculation error that propagates to subsequent steps dependent on the outcome of the miscalculated step.",

The modified transformed_solution should only include the single error in the specified step, with correct calculations in the subsequent steps except for the inherited wrong result. It should be noted that only one calculation error is considered, subsequent steps will inherit its error, and the final transformed_answer is affected as well.",
        "eval_result": "To determine if the solution is correct, we need to check if the existing steps are correct or not.\nThe solution states that it takes Mary 4 minutes to vacuum each room, and she has a total of 5 rooms in her house.\nTo vacuum her whole house, it will take her 4 * 5 = 20 minutes.\nSince the solution states that it takes her 25 minutes to vacuum her whole house, we can conclude that the solution is incorrect.\nTherefore, the correct solution would be:\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is: The solution is incorrect because it takes Mary 25 minutes to vacuum her whole house, which is longer than the battery life of her vacuum cleaner. It should take her 4 minutes per room, so the total time to vacuum her whole house should be 4 * 5 = 20 minutes. Please check the given information and provide the correct solution.\n\nThe correct solution is: 20"
