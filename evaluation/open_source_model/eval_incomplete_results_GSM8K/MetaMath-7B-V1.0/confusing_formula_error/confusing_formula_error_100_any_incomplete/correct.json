        "question": "There are 12 inches to a foot. Blossom measures her room and finds that it is exactly 10 feet long in each direction. In square inches, what is the area of her room?",
        "original_solution": "First translate the feet to inches or 10 feet * 12 inches per foot = 120 inches.\nThen use length * width which is 120 * 120 = 14400 square inches.\n#### 14400",

        "transformed_solution": "First translate the feet to inches or 10 feet * 12 inches per foot = 120 inches.\nThen use length + length + width + width which is 120 + 120 + 120 + 120 = 480 square inches.\n",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 confuses the area and the perimeter of a square. The original question requires calculating the area by multiplying the length by the width, which in this case are the same since it is a square, resulting in 120 * 120 = 14400 square inches in the original_solution. The transformation changes the area calculation into a perimeter calculation by adding the length four times instead of multiplying the length by itself once, resulting in 120 + 120 + 120 + 120 = 480 square inches in the transformed_solution. This alters the area result without affecting the conversion from feet to inches in step 1. Note that the language description \"<Then use length * width>\" in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution, which now incorrectly reflects the mathematical operation performed.",
        "eval_result": "To determine if the solution is correct, we need to check if the calculations and steps are correct.\nIn this case, the solution is incomplete, so we can only determine if the existing steps are correct or not.\nThe solution states that the area of the room is 480 square inches.\nTo find the area of the room, we need to multiply the length by the width.\nThe length is 10 feet, which is equal to 120 inches.\nThe width is also 10 feet, which is equal to 120 inches.\nSo, the area of the room is 120 inches * 120 inches = 14,400 square inches.\nTherefore, the solution is incorrect, and the correct area of the room is 480 square inches.\nThe explanation is: The solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #."

        "question": "Bob is building a garden on his land, and he wants it to be fenced in to keep out varmints. The garden is a rectangular plot 225 feet long by 125 feet wide. He also wants to have a small 3-foot wide gate to walk through and a larger 10-foot wide gate to move his gardening equipment through. How much fencing is Bob going to need to fence in his garden, taking into account the two gates?",
        "original_solution": "The perimeter of the garden is 2 * 225 + 2 * 125 = 450 + 250 = 700 feet.\nMinus the two gates, he will need at least 700 - 3 - 10 = 687 feet of fencing.\n#### 687",

The correct formula for perimeter is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width (2 * length + 2 * width), whereas the formula used in the transformation is for area (length * width). Consequently, the correct calculation for the perimeter, 2 * 225 + 2 * 125, is replaced with an incorrect calculation of area, 225 * 125. This improper calculation leads to an erroneous total length of fencing required, 28112 feet instead of the correct 687 feet. The subsequent subtraction of the gate widths is correct in itself, but stems from the incorrect calculation of the perimeter.",
