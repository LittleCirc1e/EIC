        "explanation": "Step 1 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <and an extra 5 she found in her bag>, resulting in step 1 changing from 15+10=25 napkins in the original_solution to 15+10+5=30 napkins in the transformed_solution. This erroneous information affects the calculation of napkins given by Amelia as well, where it changes from 2*10 to 2*(10+5) for a total of 30 napkins instead of 20. The incorrect resulting total amount in step 3 reflects these changes. It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct.",
