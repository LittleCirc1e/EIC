If he goes on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, what is the average time in minutes that he spends to get to the store?",
        "original_solution": "On Sunday he takes 2 hours to get there because 4 / 2 = 2\nThis takes him 120 minutes because 2 x 60 = 120\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him .4 hours to get to the store because 4 / 10 = .4\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him 24 minutes to get to the store because .4 x 60 = 24\nIn total it takes him 168 minutes to get to the store because 120 + 24 + 24 = 168\nOn average it takes him 56 minutes because 168 / 3 = 56\n#### 56",

This affects the final average calculation in step 6, changing it from 168 / 3 = 56 minutes to 144 / 3 = 48 minutes. The rest of the calculations are still correct, as we consider only one step of counting error.",

Therefore, instead of adding 120 + 24 + 24 = 168, we erroneously added 120 + 48 = 168.
