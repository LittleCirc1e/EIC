        "question": "For every black & white cookie that Elsa makes, she has to make the batter, bake the cookies for 15 minutes and then allow to cool. She then has to dip the cookies in white icing and allow the icing to harden for 30 minutes. Then she has to re-dip them in chocolate icing and allowed to harden for an additional 30 minutes. If it takes her 2 hours to make the cookies from start to finish, how long does it take to make the dough and cool the cookies before she can start dipping them?",
        "original_solution": "It takes 15 minutes to bake, 30 minutes for the white icing to harden and 30 minutes for the chocolate icing to harden so it takes 15+30+30 = 75 minutes\nEvery hour has 60 minutes and it takes her 2 hours so it takes 60*2 = 120 minutes to make the cookies\nIt takes 120 minutes to make the cookies from start to finish and she spends 75 minutes baking and hardening icing so it takes her 120-75=45 minutes to make the batter and cool the cookies\n#### 45",
        "original_answer": 45.0,
        "transformed_solution": "It takes 15 minutes to bake, 30 minutes for the white icing to harden and 30 minutes for the chocolate icing to harden so it takes 15+30+30 = 75 minutes\nEvery hour has 50 minutes and it takes her 2 hours so it takes 50*2 = 100 minutes to make the cookies\n",

        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In step 2 of the transformed_solution, I made an incorrect unit conversion error, claiming that an hour consists of 50 minutes instead of 60. This affected the time available for making the cookies, resulting in an adjusted total time of 100 minutes instead of 120 minutes. Due to this adjustment, the final calculation in the last step needed to be updated, yielding a different time of 25 minutes instead of the correct 45 minutes for making the batter and cooling the cookies.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 50 minutes.\n\nThe explanation is as follows:\n\nElsa needs to make the batter, bake the cookies for 15 minutes, and allow them to cool before she can start dipping them. This process takes a total of 50 minutes. Therefore, the answer is 50 minutes.\n\nThe solution has a mistake in the calculation of the time it takes to make the cookies. The correct calculation is:\n\n15 minutes to bake + 30 minutes to cool = 45 minutes\n\nNot 75 minutes as stated in the solution."
