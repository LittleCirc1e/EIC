The correct number of packs should be 20 * 10=200 packs, but after changing the operation, it becomes 20 / 10=2 packs. This alteration affects the following calculations, where step 2 and 3 use the incorrect number of packs. The calculation within each incorrect step is performed correctly according to the modified operation, leading to a different (incorrect) transformed_answer compared to the original_answer.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect.\n\nThe explanation is #2. The calculation 20 packs/box / 10 boxes = 2 packs is incorrect because it is not dividing the number of packs by the number of boxes. Instead, it is dividing the number of packs by the number of boxes times the number of packs in each box. To correctly calculate the total amount of money Annalise spent, we need to divide the number of packs by the number of boxes, not the number of packs in each box.\n\nThe correct calculation is 20 packs/box / 10 boxes = 200 packs.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Annalise spent to buy the ten boxes of Kleenex Ultra Soft Facial Tissues is 200 packs x 5 cents/pack = $10."

If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?",
        "original_solution": "Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $2 on the jogger jeans.\nSo, he saved $6 - $2 = $4 on the tattered jeans.\nThe original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.\nCole bought the tattered jeans for $28\nHence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.\nTherefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $8 more than the tattered jeans.\n#### 8",

Step 4 remains unchanged because no other steps affected the purchase price of the tattered jeans. However, the revised savings calculation in step 5, $28 + $8 = $36, leads to the changed conclusion in step 6, stating that jogger jeans originally cost $36 - $24 = $12 more than the tattered jeans instead of $8. Only the operator in step 2 is incorrect to induce the wrong conclusion, but its calculation is correct, as are the calculations of subsequent affected steps.",
