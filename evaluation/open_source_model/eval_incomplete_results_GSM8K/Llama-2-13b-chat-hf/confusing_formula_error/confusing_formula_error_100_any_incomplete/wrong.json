The original solution correctly uses the formula for the perimeter of a square (4*side), replacing this with the area calculation formula (side*side) in the transformed solution. As a result, the original calculation for the perimeter: 4*20 = 80 cm is incorrectly changed to an area calculation: 20*20 = 400 cm, which falsely represents the perimeter of the square paper instead of its area. This error then affects step 2, where the sum calculates the height of the computer screen using the mistaken value, changing from 20+80 = 100 cm to 20+400 = 420 cm. The language descriptions in the solution steps remain the same; only the formula used is altered to create the erroneous transformed solution.

The original solution correctly uses the formula for area by multiplying the length by the width. In the transformed solution, the formula is mistakenly changed to a perimeter calculation by adding the length and width, resulting in 120 * 120 = 14400 square inches in the original_solution becoming 120 + 120 = 240 square inches in the transformed_solution. This affects the transformed_answer while other steps remain correct and unaltered, maintaining the description language of step 2 without changing any words, consistent with the given directive that language descriptions should not be altered.

The explanation is #2, which is the correct calculation of the area of the room using the conversion of 12 inches per foot and the correct use of the formula length + width.\n\nThe solution is correct because it accurately calculates the area of the room using the given measurements and the correct conversion of feet to inches. The formula length + width is used correctly to find the area of the room, resulting in a correct answer of 240 square inches."

The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the sum of all its sides, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle, resulting in 20 feet * 40 feet = 800 square feet in the original_solution becoming 20 feet + 40 feet + 20 feet + 40 feet = 120 square feet in the transformed_solution.

The question requires solving for the total area of the mural in order to know how many square-inch tiles are needed, which is the product of its length and height, not the sum.

This fundamentally changes the answer from an area to what would be a linear measure, affecting only the formula in step 3 while leaving the language descriptions and the calculations in the prior steps unchanged.

As a result, the original_solution's correct volume of 32 cubic meters used to find the weight (2700*32) is erroneously transformed to an incorrect volume of 8 cubic meters (2+2+2+2) and the subsequent incorrect weight (2700*8).
