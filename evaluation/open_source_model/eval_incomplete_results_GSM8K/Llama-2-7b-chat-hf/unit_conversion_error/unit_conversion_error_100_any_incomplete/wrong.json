        "explanation": "In step 2 of the original_solution, an incorrect unit conversion was introduced by changing the number of minutes in an hour from 60 to 50. Therefore, the original 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes is transformed to 2 hours * 50 minutes/hour = 100 minutes. This affected the subsequent related step 4, changing 120 minutes â€“ 30 minutes - 15 minutes = 75 minutes to the incorrect 100 minutes â€“ 30 minutes - 15 minutes = 55 minutes. The transformed_answer is calculated based on this incorrect unit conversion, giving a result of 55 minutes for the bus ride instead of the correct 75 minutes.",
