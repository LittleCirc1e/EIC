From the problem, we know that s + p + 13 = 130 and p = 8s.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first, we get s + 8s + 13 = 130\nCombining like terms, we get 9s + 13 = 130\nSubtracting 8 from both sides, we get 9s = 117\nDividing both sides by 9, we get s = 13\n#### 13",

        "original_solution": "If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12*1=12 inches=1 foot.\nSince Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, then Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4*1=4 feet.\nAnd since Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami. then Naruto can lift a mountain 10*4=40 feet.\n#### 40",

And it affects the subsequent related step 2 and 3. Step 2 changes from 4*1=4 feet to 4*1=4 yards. Step 3 changes from 10*4=40 feet to 10*4=40 yards (noting there are 3 feet in a yard, the actual transformation is 10*4*3 = 120 feet).
