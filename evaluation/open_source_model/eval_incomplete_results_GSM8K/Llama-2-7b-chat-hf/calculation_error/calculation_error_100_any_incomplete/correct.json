As this is the step that contains the single introduced error, the subsequent step 3 uses the result of this incorrect calculation. Consequently, step 3 changes from the correct 150 + 100 = 250 to the incorrect 150 + 120 = 270. It is important to note that any step prior to the error and unrelated steps remain correct, only the steps that depend on the incorrect calculation inherit the error while still being calculated correctly themselves.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #. The solution states that Leo had 150 stickers last year, but the problem states that he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which means he collected 2 x 100 = 200 stickers last year. Therefore, Leo has 200 stickers in his collection."
