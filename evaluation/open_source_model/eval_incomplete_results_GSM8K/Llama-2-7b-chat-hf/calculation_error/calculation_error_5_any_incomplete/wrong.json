        "original_solution": "For every addition of 100 people added the speed is halved so for the first 100 people added its speed is 1/2 * 500 km/hr = 250 km/hr.\nFor another addition of 100 people its speed is also halved, 1/2 * 250 km/hr = 125 km/hr.

        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates 1/2 * 250 km/hr as 100 km/hr instead of 125 km/hr in step 2. This results in a transformed answer of 100 km/hr, which is different from the original answer of 125 km/hr.

        "explanation": "The transformation process includes a wrong calculation in step 2 where the sum is mistakenly changed from \"24+4 = 28 candles\" to an incorrect \"24+4 = 20 candles\". This directly affects the outcome in step 3, where the incorrect total of 20 candles is divided between the two people instead of the correct total of 28 candles. The result of this miscalculation is that each person is incorrectly calculated to get \"20/2 = 10 birthday candles\" instead of the correct answer of \"14 birthday candles\". This exemplifies a single step calculation error that propagates to subsequent steps dependent on the outcome of the miscalculated step.",
