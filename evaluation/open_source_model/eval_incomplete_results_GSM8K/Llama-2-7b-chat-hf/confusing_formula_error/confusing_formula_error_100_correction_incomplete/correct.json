A third of the rest of it will have trellises for vining plants, and the rest will be devoted to raised beds. How big will the raised bed section of the garden be?",
        "original_solution": "The garden is 220 * 120 = 26,400 square feet.\nThe tilled land will take up half the area, and the trellises and raised beds will be the other half. Each half is 26,400 / 2 = 13,200 square feet.\nThe trellises will take up 1/3 of the remaining land, so the raised beds will take 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 of the remaining land.\nSo the total area of the raised bed area will be 13,200 square feet * (2 / 3) = 8,800 square feet.\n#### 8800",

The original solution calculates the area correctly with the formula 220 * 120, but the transformed solution incorrectly calculates the perimeter with the formula 220 + 120 + 220 + 120. This confusion of formula leads to the incorrect result of 680 square feet for the perimeter instead of 26,400 square feet for the area. As a result, all subsequent calculations based on the perimeter value are affected, yet the calculations using fractions of the original area remain correctly applied to the incorrect value.

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 mistakenly uses the formula for perimeter instead of area. The original solution correctly calculated the area of Bill’s TV as 48 inches * 100 inches = 4800 square inches, but the transformed solution incorrectly uses the formula for perimeter of a rectangle, shown as 48 inches + 100 inches + 48 inches + 100 inches = 296 square inches. This wrong calculation of area for Bill’s TV impacts step 3, leading to an incorrect size difference calculation of 4200 square inches - 296 square inches = 3904 square inches. The same error cascades to step 4 and ultimately changes the final weight difference in pounds from the correct answer of 150 pounds to an incorrect answer of 975.5 pounds. Each other step is based on the respective areas, but since Bob's TV is the larger TV, we actually subtract the incorrect area for Bill's TV from the correct area of Bob's TV to find the size difference. The other steps correctly use the area to find the weight and then convert ounces to pounds. Also, note that the language of each step is unchanged, retaining the formula error only in step 1 where the perimeter is confused with the area.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is:\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 2960, which is calculated by multiplying the screen area of Bill's TV (296 square inches) by the weight per square inch of screen space (4 oz/in^2).\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the TVs have different dimensions. To find the weight of the heavier TV, we need to calculate the total area of the screen and then multiply it by the weight per square inch of screen space. In this case, the total area of the screen is 48 inches + 70 inches + 48 inches + 60 inches = 2960 square inches. Therefore, the heavier TV weighs 2960 pounds."

The following steps are updated based on this error, leading to the incorrect calculation of width and length. The perimeter formula is incorrect in this context since the question specifies the area of the rectangle. The rest of the solution correctly follows the erroneous formula, resulting in the final transformed answer of 80 m for the length of the rectangle, which is different from the original answer.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #.\n\nThe explanation is: The solution assumes that the width of the rectangle is also four times its length, which is not necessarily true. The area of the rectangle can be calculated using the formula A = L + W, where L and W are the lengths and widths of the rectangle, respectively. In this case, the area is 100 m2, which means that the length of the rectangle is not four times its width. The correct answer is 20 m."

It should be also noted that only step 1 has the confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes follow this mistaken step correctly.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #.\n\nExplanation: The solution is incorrect because there is a calculation error in step 1. The area of one side of a roof is actually 20 feet x 40 feet = 800 square feet, not 120 square feet. Therefore, the total number of shingles needed is 800 / 8 = 100 shingles."

        "question": "John carves a giant marble rectangular prism 8 meters tall with a 2-meter square base. It has a density of 2700 kg per cubic meter. How much does it weigh?",
        "original_solution": "The marble statue has a volume of 2*2*8=32 cubic meters\nSo that means it has a weight of 2700*32=86,400 kg\n#### 86,400",
        "original_answer": 86400.0,

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and volume calculations. The original_solution properly calculates the volume of the rectangular prism by multiplying the side of the square base with itself and then by the height (2*2*8), but the transformed_solution incorrectly treats the calculation as if finding the perimeter of the base (2+2+2+2). By changing the formula from volume to perimeter, the result is an incorrect volume calculation, influencing the subsequent weight calculation in step 2. As a result, the original_solution's correct volume of 32 cubic meters used to find the weight (2700*32) is erroneously transformed to an incorrect volume of 8 cubic meters (2+2+2+2) and the subsequent incorrect weight (2700*8). It's important to note that only step 1 has been modified to introduce the confusing formula error, affecting the related step 2, while no language description has been changed.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #.\n\nThe solution is incorrect because in step 4, the volume of the marble statue is calculated as 2+2+2+2=8 cubic meters, but the correct calculation is 2+2+2+2=8 cubic meters \\* 2700 kg/m^3 = 196000 kg. Therefore, the final answer is 196000 kg."
