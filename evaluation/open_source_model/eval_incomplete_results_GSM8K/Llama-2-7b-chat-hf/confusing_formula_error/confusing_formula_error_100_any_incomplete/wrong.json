The question requires that the area of the wall to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by height, rather than the sum of all four sides, which is equivalent to the perimeter, resulting in 8 ft. * 20 ft. = 160 sq. ft. in the original_solution becoming 8 ft. + 20 ft. + 8 ft. + 20 ft. = 56 sq. ft. in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent related step, where the total wall area calculation changes from 4 * 160 sq. ft. = 640 sq. ft. to 4 * 56 sq. ft. = 224 sq. ft., and the final calculation changes from 640 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 560 sq. ft. to 224 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 144 sq. ft. Note that the language description of step 1 <The solid wall is> in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct.

        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the area and perimeter of the rectangle. The question requires solving for the total area of the mural in order to know how many square-inch tiles are needed, which is the product of its length and height, not the sum. This change is made by swapping multiplication for addition, transforming the correct area formula (length * height) into an incorrect perimeter one (length + height), thus altering the calculation from 180 inches * 120 inches = 21600 square inches to 180 inches + 120 inches = 300 inches. This fundamentally changes the answer from an area to what would be a linear measure, affecting only the formula in step 3 while leaving the language descriptions and the calculations in the prior steps unchanged.
