        "question": "Bob is building a vegetable garden. It is 220 feet long by 120 feet wide. Half of the garden is going to be tilled land. A third of the rest of it will have trellises for vining plants, and the rest will be devoted to raised beds. How big will the raised bed section of the garden be?",
        "original_solution": "The garden is 220 * 120 = 26,400 square feet.\nThe tilled land will take up half the area, and the trellises and raised beds will be the other half. Each half is 26,400 / 2 = 13,200 square feet.\nThe trellises will take up 1/3 of the remaining land, so the raised beds will take 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 of the remaining land.\nSo the total area of the raised bed area will be 13,200 square feet * (2 / 3) = 8,800 square feet.\n#### 8800",

The original solution calculates the area correctly with the formula 220 * 120, but the transformed solution incorrectly calculates the perimeter with the formula 220 + 120 + 220 + 120. This confusion of formula leads to the incorrect result of 680 square feet for the perimeter instead of 26,400 square feet for the area. As a result, all subsequent calculations based on the perimeter value are affected, yet the calculations using fractions of the original area remain correctly applied to the incorrect value.

However, the raised bed section of the garden is not 680 square feet. To determine the size of the raised bed section, we need to subtract the area of the tilled land and the area of the trellises from the total area of the garden. The tilled land is half of the garden, which is 110 feet long by 120 feet wide, or 13200 square feet. The trellises cover a third of the rest of the garden, which is 120 feet long by 120 feet wide, or 14400 square feet.

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and area of rectangle. The question requires the area of the rectangle to be solved, which is equal to the length multiplied by width. Instead, the transformed solution incorrectly calculates the perimeter by adding all sides, resulting in 2 feet * 4 feet = 8 square feet in the original_solution changing to 2 feet + 4 feet + 2 feet + 4 feet = 12 square feet in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 3, changing the calculation of the percentage of the wall covered from 8 square feet / 50 square feet * 100% = 16% to 12 square feet / 50 square feet * 100% = 24%. Note that the language description of step 1 < First find the area of the painting: > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that only one step of confusing formula error is considered, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 1 mistakenly uses the formula for rectangular area, while the other steps correctly calculate the area of the wall and the percentage.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #. The solution is incorrect because it does not take into account the dimensions of the wall. To find the percentage of the wall taken up by the painting, you need to divide the area of the painting by the area of the wall. In this case, the area of the wall is 5 feet x 10 feet = 50 square feet, so the percentage of the wall taken up by the painting is 12 square feet / 50 square feet = 24%."

The windows are 1m by 1.5m, the blackboards are 6m by 1m, and the doors are 2m by 1m. It is known that the paint fee is $4.80 per square meter. How much does it cost to paint a classroom?",

        "original_solution": "The marble statue has a volume of 2*2*8=32 cubic meters\nSo that means it has a weight of 2700*32=86,400 kg\n#### 86,400",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,

The original_solution properly calculates the volume of the rectangular prism by multiplying the side of the square base with itself and then by the height (2*2*8), but the transformed_solution incorrectly treats the calculation as if finding the perimeter of the base (2+2+2+2). By changing the formula from volume to perimeter, the result is an incorrect volume calculation, influencing the subsequent weight calculation in step 2. As a result, the original_solution's correct volume of 32 cubic meters used to find the weight (2700*32) is erroneously transformed to an incorrect volume of 8 cubic meters (2+2+2+2) and the subsequent incorrect weight (2700*8). It's important to note that only step 1 has been modified to introduce the confusing formula error, affecting the related step 2, while no language description has been changed.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #. The volume of the marble statue is not 8 cubic meters. The volume of a rectangular prism is given by the formula: Volume = Length x Width x Height, where the length, width, and height are the dimensions of the prism. In this case, the height is 8 meters, and the width and length are each 2 meters, so the volume of the marble statue is: Volume = 8 x 2 x 2 = 32 cubic meters. Therefore, the marble statue weighs 32 x 2700 = 86,400 kg."
