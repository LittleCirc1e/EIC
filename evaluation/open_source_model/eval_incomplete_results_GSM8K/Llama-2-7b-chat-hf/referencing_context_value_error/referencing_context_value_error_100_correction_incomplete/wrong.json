He ordered a nice appetizer for $8, a delicious ribeye steak for his entrée at $20, had two glasses of nice red wine with dinner for $3 each, and a slice of caramel cheesecake for dessert for $6. He used a voucher for half off the price of his entrée, but he very thoughtfully tipped his waitress a full 20% of what the full cost of his meal would have been without the discount. How much, including the tip, did Arthur spend on dinner?",
        "original_solution": "The cost of his food, before the voucher, was $8 + $20 + $3 + $3 + $6 = $40.\nThe tip was $40 * .20 = $8.\nThe voucher saved him $20 / 2 = $10.\nSo the full price of Arthur's meal, with tip, was $40 - $10 + 8 = $38.\n#### 38",

The voucher reduced the cost of the entrée by $10, so the total cost of the food after the voucher is $44 - $10 = $34. The tip of 20% of the full cost of the meal without the voucher is $34 x 0.20 = $6.80, so the total cost of dinner including the tip is $34 + $6.80 = $40.80."
