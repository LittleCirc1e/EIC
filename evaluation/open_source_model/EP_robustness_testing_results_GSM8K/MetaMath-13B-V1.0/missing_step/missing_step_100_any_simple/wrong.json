Therefore, after deleting step 1, step 3 should reference the number 16 from the question and change the formula from 6 - 4 = 2 to 6 - 16 = -10, resulting in Susannah \"swimming\" -10 more times a week than Camden, which is logically incorrect since the frequency of swimming cannot be negative. However, as per the transformation rules, the logical correctness of the transformation is not under consideration. It is step 2 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 3 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing incorrect number in the transformed_solution based on the deletion, so the wrong_step is 2.",
