        "explanation": "This example removes the intermediate step 4 from the original_solution, which converts the number of blue socks into pairs. After deleting this step, step 5 instantaneously refers to the number of blue socks pairs by dividing by 2 (since 1 pair equals 2 socks), which changes the formula from 6-3=3 pairs of black socks to 6/2-3=0 pairs of black socks. The change leads to calculating 0 black socks instead of 6, and the remaining steps that calculate the total number of socks refer to this new value. Therefore, removing step 4 causes a fundamental miscalculation in the number of black socks, leading to the first erroneous reference at step 5 in the transformed solution. It should be noted that the number 3 from step 5, referring to how many fewer pairs of black socks there are compared to blue, remains intact as the required reference from the question.

However, since we're deleting the first step and not recalculating the number of species with the new additions, we're incorrectly using the original number of species (5). The subsequent step that originally referenced the result of step 1 now incorrectly references the original number of species (5), leading to the calculation of 5 * 6 = 30 minutes instead of the correct 9 * 6 = 54 minutes. The wrong_step is 1 because it is the first step performed in the transformed_solution, which references the incorrect number (5) instead of the new total (9).",

Similarly, the final step, which calculates the sum of the sentences, shifts from referencing 12 years for arson to directly referencing the arithmetic producing 12 years, effectively changing 12 years to 6 years/count * 2 counts.
