        "question": "Sally and Bob have made plans to go on a trip at the end of the year. They both decide to work as babysitters and save half of what they've earned for their trip. If Sally makes $6 per day and Bob makes $4 per day, how much money will they both have saved for their trip after a year?",
        "transformed_solution": "Saly saves 1/2 * $6/day = $3/day.\nSince each year have 365 days, the total amount of money Sally will save in a year is $3/day * 365 days/year = $1095/year\nBob saves 1/2 * $4/day = $2/day.\nThe total amount of money Bob will have saved in a year is $2/day * 365 days/year = $730/year\nIn total, Sally and Bob would have saved $730 + $1095 = $1825\n#### 1825",
        "label": "yes",
        "eval_result": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the total amount of money Sally and Bob will have saved for their trip after a year.\nLet's break down the information given:\nAmount of money Sally makes per day: $6\nAmount of money Bob makes per day: $4\nNumber of days in a year: 365\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\nAmount of money Sally saves in a year + Amount of money Bob saves in a year = Total amount of money saved for the trip\n($3/day * 365 days/year) + ($2/day * 365 days/year) = $1825\nLet's simplify and solve for x:\n$3 * 365 + $2 * 365 = $1825\n$1095 + $730 = $1825\nTo solve for x, we add $1095 and $730:\n$1095 + $730 = $1825\nTherefore, the value of the unknown variable x is $1825.The answer is: 1825"
