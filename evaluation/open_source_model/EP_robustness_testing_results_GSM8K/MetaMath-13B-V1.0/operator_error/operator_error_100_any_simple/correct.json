        "explanation": "This example turns the addition in step 1 into multiplication, and by changing + to *, 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 3 hours becomes 1.5 hours * 1.5 hours = 2.25 hours. This affects the subsequent related step 2 and 3. Step 2 changes from 5 hours - 3 hours = 2 hours to 5 hours - 2.25 hours = 2.75 hours, and step 3 changes from 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour to 2.75 hours / 2 = 1.375 hours. It should be noted that only the operator in step 1 is incorrect, but its calculation is correct, which leads to its result being incorrect. This affects the subsequent steps of using its results, but all the calculation of the steps affected by step 1 is correct.",
