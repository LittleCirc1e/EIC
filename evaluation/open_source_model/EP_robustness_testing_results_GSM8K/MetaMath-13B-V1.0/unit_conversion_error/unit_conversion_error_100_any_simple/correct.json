Following this, the number of dishes is recalculated to be 5 instead of 6, and as a result, the total number of people who can be fed is decreased from 30 to 25.",

        "eval_result": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the number of people Megan can feed with the dishes she prepared.\nWe know that each dish can feed 5 people. Therefore, the number of people Megan can feed is equal to the number of dishes multiplied by 5.\nWe also know that Megan spent 2 hours preparing the dishes, which is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.\nLet's calculate the number of dishes Megan can prepare in 100 minutes:\n100 minutes / 20 minutes per dish = 5 dishes\nTherefore, Megan can feed 5 * 5 = 25 people with the dishes she prepared.\nThe value of x is 25.The answer is: 25"
