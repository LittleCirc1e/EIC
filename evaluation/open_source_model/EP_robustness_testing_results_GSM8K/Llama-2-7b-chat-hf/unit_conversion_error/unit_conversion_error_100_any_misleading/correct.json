The student's reasoning process and final answer contain several errors.\n\nFirstly, the student has not provided any explanation for why it takes twice as long to dry a full-haired, fluffy dog like a German Shepherd compared to a short-haired dog like a Beagle. This is a crucial aspect of the problem, as it determines the total time required to dry all the dogs.\n\nSecondly, the student has incorrectly calculated the time required to dry each dog. The student has multiplied the time taken to dry a short-haired dog by 2, which is not correct. The time taken to dry a full-haired dog should be twice the time taken to dry a short-haired dog, not twice the time taken to dry a single dog.\n\nLastly, the student has not considered the total number of dogs to be dried. The student has calculated the time required to dry each dog separately, without considering the total number of dogs to be dried.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is #4.8 hours."
