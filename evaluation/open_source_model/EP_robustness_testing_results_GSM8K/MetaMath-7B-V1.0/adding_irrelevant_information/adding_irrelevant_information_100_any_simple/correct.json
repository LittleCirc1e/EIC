        "question": "Gerald spends $100 a month on baseball supplies. His season is 4 months long. He wants to use the months he's not playing baseball to save up by raking, shoveling, and mowing lawns. He charges $10 for each. How many chores does he need to average a month to save up for his supplies?",
        "transformed_solution": "He needs to save up $400 because 4 x 100 = 400\nHe has 8 months to earn this money because 12 - 4 = 8\nHe needs to earn $50 a month because 400 / 8 = 50\nHe needs to do 5 tasks a month because 50 / 10 = 5\n#### 5",
        "label": "yes",
        "eval_result": "The [Solution] is correct because Gerald needs to earn $50 a month and do 5 tasks a month to save up for his baseball supplies.\nTherefore, the string of 'yes' represents the correct answer.\n#### 5\nThe answer is: 5"
