        "original_solution": "Susan picked 3 times as much as 36 which is 3*36 = 108 apples\nShe gave out half which is 108*(1/2) = 54 apples\nShe now has 108-54 = 54 apples\nFrank sold a third of 36 which is 36*(1/3) = 12 apples\nFrank now has 36-12 = 24 apples\nAltogether they now have 54+24 = 78 apples\n#### 78",

        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In the transformation, step 2 of the original solution mistakenly changes the multiplication operator to division, altering the original procedure of dividing Susan's apples by 2. Instead of correctly calculating the half as 108*(1/2), the erroneous step applies division as 108/(1/2), which mathematically results in doubling the number of apples. This leads to a negative count of apples since Susan cannot have fewer apples than she gives away. Consequently, all subsequent steps that depend on the result of this step are affected, although the arithmetic within those steps remains accurate.",
        "label": "no",
        "eval_result": "The [Solution] is incorrect, as it leads to an inconsistent state. It is not possible to have a negative number of apples. Therefore, the [Solution] is incorrect, and the string of 'no' should be output as the response.The answer is: 84"

        "original_solution": "Their total age is 15 because 3 x 5 = 15\n15 - X - 2X - (X-1) is equivalent to 16 = 4X\nMaiya is 4 years old because 16 / 4 = 4\n#### 4",

        "transformed_solution": "Their total age is 15 because 3 x 5 = 15\n15 - X - 2X + (X-1) is equivalent to 16 = 2X\nMaiya is 8 years old because 16 / 2 = 8\n#### 8",

        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The error is introduced by changing the subtraction of (X - 1) to addition in the second step. This turns the equation 15 - X - 2X - (X-1) = 16 = 4X into 15 - X - 2X + (X-1) = 16 = 2X, incorrectly simplifying the ages. All other aspects of the solution are correct, including the arithmetic in the transformed steps. This leads to a different incorrect result for Maiya's age.",
        "label": "no",
        "eval_result": "To determine if the solution is correct, we need to check if the equation is true.\nThe equation given is:\n16 = 2X\nTo solve for X, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n16 / 2 = X\n8 = X\nTherefore, the value of the unknown variable X is 8.The answer is: 8"
