        "question": "From Monday to Friday, Elle practices piano for 30 minutes. On Saturday, she practices piano three times as much as on a weekday. There is no practice on Sunday.  How many hours does Elle spend practicing piano each week?",
        "original_solution": "From Monday to Friday, Elle practices 0.50 x 5 = 2.5 hours.\nOn Saturday, she practices 0.50 x 3 = 1.5 hours.\nEach week, Elle practices piano for 2.5 + 1.5 = 4 hours.\n#### 4",
        "original_answer": 4.0,
        "transformed_solution": "From Monday to Friday, Elle practices 0.50 x 5 = 2.5 hours.\nOn Saturday, she practices 0.50 x 2 = 1.0 hours.\nEach week, Elle practices piano for 2.5 + 1.0 = 3.5 hours.\n#### 3.5",
        "transformed_answer": 3.5,
        "wrong_step": 2,
        "wrong_type": "counting_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 erroneously counts the practice time on Saturday as if Elle practices twice the amount of a weekday (0.50 x 2) instead of three times, resulting in 1.5 hours being changed to 1.0 hour. This error subsequently affects step 3, where the total weekly practice time is calculated, leading to 2.5 + 1.5 = 4 changing to 2.5 + 1.0 = 3.5. It is important to note that only the counting in step 2 is erroneous; the rest of the steps are correctly executed based on this incorrect assumption.",

        "eval_result": "To determine if the solution is correct, we need to convert the hours to minutes and check if the total minutes match the given answer.\n\nFrom Monday to Friday, Elle practices 2.5 hours x 60 minutes = 150 minutes.\nOn Saturday, she practices 1.0 hour x 60 minutes = 60 minutes.\nEach week, Elle practices piano for 150 + 60 = 210 minutes.\n\nThe given answer is 3.5 hours, which is equal to 3.5 x 60 = 210 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the solution is correct. The string of 'yes' represents the correct answer.\n\nThe value of unknown variable x is not provided in this question.The answer is: 210"
