        "question": "From Monday to Friday, Elle practices piano for 30 minutes. On Saturday, she practices piano three times as much as on a weekday. There is no practice on Sunday. How many hours does Elle spend practicing piano each week?",
        "original_solution": "From Monday to Friday, Elle practices 0.50 x 5 = 2.5 hours.\nOn Saturday, she practices 0.50 x 3 = 1.5 hours.\nEach week, Elle practices piano for 2.5 + 1.5 = 4 hours.\n#### 4",
        "original_answer": 4.0,
        "transformed_solution": "From Monday to Friday, Elle practices 0.50 x 5 = 2.5 hours.\nOn Saturday, she practices 0.50 x 2 = 1 hour.\nEach week, Elle practices piano for 2.5 + 1 = 3.5 hours.\n#### 3.5",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 erroneously counts Saturday as equivalent to 2 weekdays instead of 3 in the original_solution, resulting in the calculation of 0.50 x 3 = 1.5 hours being changed to 0.50 x 2 = 1 hour. This affects step 3, where Elle's total weekly practice is changed from 2.5 + 1.5 = 4 hours to 2.5 + 1 = 3.5 hours. It should be noted that only the counting for Saturday is changed, so the rest of the calculation is unaffected and the transformed_answer is now 3.5 instead of the original 4.",
        "label": "no",
        "eval_result": "To determine if the solution is correct, we need to convert the given hours into minutes and check if the total minutes match the given answer.\n\nFrom Monday to Friday, Elle practices 2.5 hours x 60 minutes = 150 minutes.\nOn Saturday, she practices 1 hour x 60 minutes = 60 minutes.\nEach week, Elle practices piano for 150 + 60 = 210 minutes.\n\nThe given answer is 3.5 hours, which is equal to 3.5 x 60 = 210 minutes.\n\nSince the total minutes match the given answer, the solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the unknown variable x is 3.5.The answer is: 3.5"

He wants to use the months he's not playing baseball to save up by raking, shoveling, and mowing lawns. He charges $10 for each. How many chores does he need to average a month to save up for his supplies?",
        "transformed_solution": "He needs to save up $400 because 4 x 100 = 400\nHe has 8 months to earn this money because 12 - 4 = 8\nHe needs to earn $50 a month because 400 / 8 = 50\nHe needs to do 5 tasks a month because 50 / 10 = 5\n#### 5",
