        "explanation": "In the original_solution, the first step calculates Ferdinand's number of trees as 6/2=3. The second step uses that result to calculate Harry's number of trees. By deleting the first step, we must adjust the second step to directly use information from the question; however, we should still ensure that the final answer is different from the original answer. Therefore, the second step should begin with 5 plus twice Ferdinand's number assuming Ferdinand's original number 6 directly from the question (2*(6/2) instead of 2*3). However, to generate a different transformed answer, an error is introduced by not updating the numerical operations correctly. The formula is altered incorrectly to 5+2*3=5+6=11 trees. Finally, instead of subtracting Ferdinand's mistaken number of trees (which could be 6 after deleting the first step), we subtract the correct original amount (3 trees), resulting in a wrong answer of 11-3=8 trees. The transformed answer should be 5 to be different from the original answer. 'Wrong_step' is 1, where the first step that references the correct result from the deleted step now directly references numbers from the question.",

        "question": "Gerald spends $100 a month on baseball supplies. His season is 4 months long. He wants to use the months he's not playing baseball to save up by raking, shoveling, and mowing lawns. He charges $10 for each. How many chores does he need to average a month to save up for his supplies?",
        "transformed_solution": "He needs to save up $400 because 4 x 100 = 400\nHe has 8 months to earn this money because 12 - 4 = 8\nHe needs to earn $50 a month because 400 / 8 = 50\nHe needs to do 5 tasks a month because 50 / 10 = 5\n#### 5",
