        "question": "It took Dad 5 more than twice as long to vacuum upstairs then to vacuum downstairs. He vacuumed for a total of 38 minutes. How many minutes did he vacuum upstairs?",
        "original_solution": "Let D = time in minutes to vacuum downstairs\nUpstairs = 2D + 5 minutes\n3D + 5 = 38\n3D = 33\nD = 11 minutes\nUpstairs = (2 * 11) + 5 = 27 minutes\nDad took 27 minutes to vacuum upstairs.\n#### 27",
        "original_answer": 27.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Let D = time in minutes to vacuum downstairs\nUpstairs = 2D + 5 minutes\n3D + 5 = 38\nD = 38 / 3\nUpstairs = (2 * (38 / 3)) + 5 = 29 minutes\nDad took 29 minutes to vacuum upstairs.\n#### 29",

        "explanation": "This example removes intermediate step 4 from the original_solution. In the original_solution, step 4 references the result of 33 from the previous step 3, and the following steps reference the result of step 4. Therefore, after deleting step 4, the remaining calculations must be modified to relate directly to the outcome of step 3. Step 4 changes from 3D = 33 to D = 38 / 3, as this step should now deal with the equation in its unresolved form since the calculation to isolate D has been removed. Subsequently, in the calculation for determining the upstairs vacuuming time in step 5, the reference to 11 minutes for D should change to use the expression 38 / 3 directly, so it goes from (2 * 11) to (2 * (38 / 3)). This step also changes the language description based on the new calculation for D. The new step computes the total time as 29 minutes. It is step 4 in the transformed_solution, which references and is impacted by the removed step, that serves as the first step referencing incorrect number in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 4.",

        "eval_result": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the number of minutes Dad took to vacuum upstairs.\nWe know that the solution is incorrect, so we can format our response as \"The solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #.\"\nLet's break down the information given:\nTime taken to vacuum downstairs: D minutes\nTime taken to vacuum upstairs: 2D + 5 minutes\nTotal time taken: 38 minutes\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\nTime taken to vacuum downstairs + Time taken to vacuum upstairs = Total time taken\nD + (2D + 5) = 38\nLet's simplify and solve for D:\n3D + 5 = 38\nTo isolate D, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n3D + 5 - 5 = 38 - 5\n3D = 33\nTo solve for D, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\nD = 33 / 3\nD = 11\nNow, we can find the value of x, which represents the number of minutes Dad took to vacuum upstairs:\nx = 2D + 5\nx = 2 * 11 + 5\nx = 22 + 5\nx = 27\nThe value of x is 27.The answer is: 27"
