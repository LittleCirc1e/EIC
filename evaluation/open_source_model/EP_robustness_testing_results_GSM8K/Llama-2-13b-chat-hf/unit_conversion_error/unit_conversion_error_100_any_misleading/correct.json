        "explanation": "Here, step 1 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 foot is wrongly equal to 10 inches instead of 12 inches, resulting in 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches in the original_solution becoming 4 feet is equal to 4 x 10 = 40 inches in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 2, which changes from 48 + 3 = 51 inches tall to 40 + 3 = 43 inches tall. This also changes the result in step 4, which changes from 72/12 = 6 feet tall to 64/12 = 5.33 feet tall. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error without affecting the previous or unrelated steps, and the transformed_answer should be different from original_answer.",

The student has correctly calculated the height of Marissa's sister, but they have made a mistake when converting the height of the sunflower from inches to feet. The correct conversion is 64/12 = 5.33 feet, not 5.33 inches. Therefore, the final answer should be 5 feet 3.3 inches, not 5.33 feet."

The units of speed are meters per second, not meters per minute. To convert kilometers to meters, the student should have multiplied by 1000, not 10000. Therefore, the correct calculation is:\n\n3 kilometers x 1000 = 3000 meters\n\n3000 meters / 60 seconds = 50 meters per second\n\n50 meters per second x 60 seconds = 3000 meters per minute\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 3000 meters per minute, not 30 meters per minute."
