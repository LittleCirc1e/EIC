Since Josh has soccer practice on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and band practice on Tuesday and Thursday, there is some overlap between the two activities. To calculate the total hours spent on extracurricular activities, we need to subtract the time spent on one activity that overlaps with another. In this case, Josh spends 2 hours on soccer on Tuesday and Thursday, which overlaps with his band practice. Therefore, we need to subtract 2 hours from the total hours spent on extracurricular activities. The correct calculation is:\n\n6 hours (soccer) + 4.5 hours (band) - 2 hours (overlap) = 6 + 4.5 - 2 = 10 hours\n\nSo, Josh spends 10 hours on extracurricular activities from Monday to Friday."

However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that Kimo has two 2-hour classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to first calculate the total number of hours he spends on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and then add the total number of hours he spends on Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nCorrected solution:\n\nKimo spends 3 x 1 = 3 hours in class on any given Monday, Wednesday or Friday.\nEach week, he spends 3 x 3 = 9 hours in class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.\nIn one semester, he spends 9 x 16 = 144 hours in class for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.\nHe spends 2 x 2 = 4 hours in class on any given Tuesday or Thursday.\nEach week, he spends 4 x 2 = 8 hours in class on Tuesday and Thursday.\nIn one semester, he spends 8 x 16 = 128 hours in class on Tuesday and Thursday.\nIn total for one semester, Kimo spends 144 + 128 = 272 hours attending classes.\n#### 272."
