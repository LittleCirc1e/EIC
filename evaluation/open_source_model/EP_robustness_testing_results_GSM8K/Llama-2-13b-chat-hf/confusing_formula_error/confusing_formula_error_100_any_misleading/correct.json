This results in calculating the perimeter for the third level (3+3+3+3 cases) instead of the area (3 cases * 3 cases). Consequently, this affects the final step, changing the correct total number of cases from 30 to an incorrect total of 33 cases.

        "explanation": "In this case, the confusing_formula_error occurred at step 3 where the original solution correctly uses the formula for area of a rectangle (L * W) to find the width and length (80 = L * W). The transformation incorrectly uses the perimeter formula (L + W) instead of the area formula, modifying the equation to 100 = L + W. The following steps are updated based on this error, leading to the incorrect calculation of width and length. The perimeter formula is incorrect in this context since the question specifies the area of the rectangle. The rest of the solution correctly follows the erroneous formula, resulting in the final transformed answer of 80 m for the length of the rectangle, which is different from the original answer.",

This means that the student should have added 4W instead of W to the equation. Additionally, the student should have solved for L instead of W. Therefore, the correct solution is L = 4W, and the final answer is L = 4(20) = 80 m."
