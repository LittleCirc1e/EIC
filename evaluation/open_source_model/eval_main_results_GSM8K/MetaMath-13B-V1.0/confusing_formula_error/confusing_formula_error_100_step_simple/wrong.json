        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and area of rectangle. The question requires that the area of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the sum of all its sides, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle, resulting in 20 feet * 40 feet = 800 square feet in the original_solution becoming 20 feet + 40 feet + 20 feet + 40 feet = 120 square feet in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent related steps due to the propagation of the error in the calculations, changing the original answers from 1600 square feet, 4800 square feet, and 38400 shingles to the transformed answers of 240 square feet, 720 square feet, and 5760 shingles respectively. Note that the language description of step 1 <First find the area of one side of a roof> in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that only step 1 has the confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes follow this mistaken step correctly.",

        "explanation": "Here, step 3 confuses the area and perimeter of the rectangle. The question requires solving for the total area of the mural in order to know how many square-inch tiles are needed, which is the product of its length and height, not the sum. This change is made by swapping multiplication for addition, transforming the correct area formula (length * height) into an incorrect perimeter one (length + height), thus altering the calculation from 180 inches * 120 inches = 21600 square inches to 180 inches + 120 inches = 300 inches. This fundamentally changes the answer from an area to what would be a linear measure, affecting only the formula in step 3 while leaving the language descriptions and the calculations in the prior steps unchanged. As such, the confused formula results in an erroneous count of tiles that would be needed if the mural's perimeter rather than its area were relevant.",

The original_solution properly calculates the volume of the rectangular prism by multiplying the side of the square base with itself and then by the height (2*2*8), but the transformed_solution incorrectly treats the calculation as if finding the perimeter of the base (2+2+2+2). By changing the formula from volume to perimeter, the result is an incorrect volume calculation, influencing the subsequent weight calculation in step 2. As a result, the original_solution's correct volume of 32 cubic meters used to find the weight (2700*32) is erroneously transformed to an incorrect volume of 8 cubic meters (2+2+2+2) and the subsequent incorrect weight (2700*8).
