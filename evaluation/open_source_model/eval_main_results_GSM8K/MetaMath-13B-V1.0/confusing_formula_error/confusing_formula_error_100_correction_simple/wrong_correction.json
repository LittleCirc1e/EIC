        "question": "Jerry needs to shingle 3 roofs. Each roof is made of two slanted rectangular sides measuring 20 feet by 40 feet. If he needs 8 shingles to cover one square foot of roof, how many shingles does he need total?",
        "original_solution": "First find the area of one side of a roof: 20 feet * 40 feet = 800 square feet\nThen multiply that number by 2 to find the total area of both sides of the roof: 800 square feet/side * 2 sides = 1600 square feet\nThen multiply that number by the number of roofs to find the total area of all the roofs: 1600 square feet/roof * 3 roofs = 4800 square feet\nThen multiply the total area of the roofs by the number of shingles needed per square foot to find the total number of shingles needed: 4800 square feet * 8 singles/square foot = 38400 shingles\n#### 38400",
        "original_answer": 38400.0,
        "transformed_solution": "First find the area of one side of a roof: 20 feet + 40 feet = 60 feet\nThen multiply that number by 2 to find the total area of both sides of the roof: 60 feet/side * 2 sides = 120 feet\nThen multiply that number by the number of roofs to find the total area of all the roofs: 120 feet/roof * 3 roofs = 360 feet\nThen multiply the total area of the roofs by the number of shingles needed per square foot to find the total number of shingles needed: 360 feet * 8 singles/foot = 2880 shingles\n#### 2880",
        "transformed_answer": 2880.0,
        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The error in step 1 is confusing the formula for calculating the perimeter with the formula for calculating the area of a rectangle. Instead of multiplying the length by the width to find the area, the length and width were added together, as if calculating the perimeter. This affected all the subsequent steps as they depend on the correct area calculation. The correct process should be 20 feet * 40 feet, but it was replaced by 20 feet + 40 feet. Note that the language description in the step 1 remains unchanged: < First find the area of one side of a roof: >. Only one step has been modified erroneously, while other steps followed through based on that error without making further mistakes involving the use of formulas.",
        "eval_result": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the total number of shingles needed.\nLet's break down the information given:\nArea of one side of a roof: 20 feet * 40 feet = 800 square feet\nTotal area of both sides of a roof: 800 square feet * 2 = 1600 square feet\nTotal area of all the roofs: 1600 square feet * 3 = 4800 square feet\nNumber of shingles needed per square foot: 8 shingles\nTotal number of shingles needed: 4800 square feet * 8 shingles/square foot = 38400 shingles\nTherefore, the value of the unknown variable x is 2880. The solution is incorrect, and the correct answer is 38400.The answer is: 38400"
