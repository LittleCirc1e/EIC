        "question": "Jane purchased 15 ice cream cones and 5 cups of pudding. Each ice cream cone cost $5 and each cup of pudding cost $2. How much more did Jane spend on ice cream than on pudding, in dollars?",
        "original_solution": "The cost of 15 cones of ice cream was 15 × $5 = $75.\nThe cost of the 5 cups of pudding was 5 × $2 = $10.\nJane spent $75 - $10 = $65 more on ice cream than on pudding.\n#### 65",
        "original_answer": 65.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The cost of 15 cones of ice cream was 15 ÷ $5 = $3.\nThe cost of the 5 cups of pudding was 5 × $2 = $10.\nJane spent $3 - $10 = -$7 more on ice cream than on pudding.\n#### -7",

        "explanation": "This example converts the multiplication in step 1 into division, changing 15 × $5 = $75 to 15 ÷ $5 = $3 by changing × to ÷. Its subsequent step 2 related to it remains the same. Then step 3 uses the results from step 1, and the correct calculation should be $3 - $10 = -$7. The result of step 3 is incorrect due to the wrong calculation of step 1.",
        "eval_result": "To determine if the solution is correct, we need to compare the given solution with the correct or incorrect format.\nThe given solution is:\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #, which is your explanation about why the solution is incorrect.\nSince the given solution is in the incorrect format, it means that the solution is incorrect.\nTherefore, the answer is incorrect.The answer is: 7"
