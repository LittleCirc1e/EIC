If she drives to and from school every day, how many school days will it take Jessica to meet the 50-hour driving requirement?",
        "original_solution": "Jessica will drive 20 minutes, twice every school day (to and from school), so 20 minutes x 2 trips = 40 minutes each day.\nThere are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so 50 hours of driving x 60 minutes/hour = 3000 minutes.\nIf you take the 3000 minutes she needs to drive / 40 minutes driving each day = 75 school days to drive 50 hours.\n#### 75",

        "explanation": "In step 2, the unit conversion for minutes to hours is incorrectly stated as 50 minutes in 1 hour instead of 60 minutes in 1 hour. Consequently, step 3, which is related to step 2, calculates the number of days based on this incorrect conversion, changing from an original solution of 3000 minutes total to 2500 minutes total. The calculation now shows Jessica would need 62.5 days instead of 75 days to meet the driving requirement. This unit conversion error only affects the steps related to the total minutes calculation and not the unrelated steps.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #75 school days.\n\nExplanation: The solution assumes that Jessica drives to and from school every day, which is not the case. Since Jessica only needs to drive 50 hours, she can do so in less than 50 days, assuming she drives for 8 hours a day (50 hours / 8 hours/day = 6.25 days). Therefore, the correct answer is 75 school days."
