Consequently, the sets of time divisions for Jane, Kyla, and Anthony are recalculated based on a 50-minute hour (steps 2, 4, and 6) instead of 60 minutes, which affects their individual totals (steps 3, 5, and 7) and the final cumulative total (step 8).

The solution is correct because the total number of towels that Jane, Kyla, and Anthony can fold in 1 hour is indeed 72.5 towels, as calculated in the solution.
