        "explanation": "Step 2 mistakenly references 401 as 401 from step 1 but changes 401 - 15 to 385 instead of the correct 386. It should be noted that step 1 in the transformed_solution <Uncle Ben has 440 chickens - 39 roosters = 401 hens.> should be the same as the step 1 in the original_solution <Uncle Ben has 440 chickens - 39 roosters = 401 hens.> and calculates its result 401 correctly. The subsequent step 3, which is related to step 2, is affected by the incorrect subtraction result but is still calculated correctly as 3 * 385 to give 1155 eggs. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all steps is still correct, and the transformed_answer 1155 is different from the original_answer 1158.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct, and the explanation is #. The calculation process is correct, and there is no error in the solution.\n\nThe first step correctly calculates the number of roosters, and the second step correctly calculates the number of egg-laying hens by subtracting the number of roosters from the total number of chickens. The third step correctly calculates the number of eggs laid by the egg-laying hens by multiplying the number of egg-laying hens by the number of eggs each lays. Therefore, the final answer is 1155 eggs."
