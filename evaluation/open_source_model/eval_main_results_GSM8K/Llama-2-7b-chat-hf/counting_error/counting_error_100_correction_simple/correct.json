        "original_solution": "Ludwig earns a total of $10 x 4 = $40 from Monday to Thursday.\nHe earns $10/2= $5 per day on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.\nSo, his total salary for Friday, Saturday, Sunday is $5 x 3 = $15.\nTherefore, his total weekly salary is $40 + $15 = $55.\n#### 55",
        "original_answer": 55.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Ludwig earns a total of $10 x 4 = $40 from Monday to Thursday.\nHe earns $10/2 = $5 per day on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.\nSo, his total salary for Friday, Saturday, Sunday is $5 x 2 = $10.\nTherefore, his total weekly salary is $40 + $10 = $50.\n#### 50",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 3 erroneously counts Friday, Saturday, and Sunday as 2 days instead of 3 days. This changes the total salary calculation for these days from $5 x 3 = $15 to $5 x 2 = $10 in the transformed_solution. And it affects step 4, the final weekly salary calculation changes from $40 + $15 = $55 to $40 + $10 = $50. It should be noted that you only need to consider this one step of counting error, and the other calculation processes are still correct.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #55.\n\nExplanation: The solution assumes that Ludwig works half of the day on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, which means he works 4 hours per day. However, the question states that he works half of the day, which means he works 2 hours per day. Therefore, his total salary for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday is $10 x 2 = $20, not $10. So, his total weekly salary is $40 + $20 = $60. #55."
