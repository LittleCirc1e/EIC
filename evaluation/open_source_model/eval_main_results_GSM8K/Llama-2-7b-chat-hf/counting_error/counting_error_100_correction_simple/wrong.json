        "original_solution": "In an hour, the baker bakes 5 x 4 = 20 loaves of bread.\nFrom Monday to Friday, he bakes 5 x 20 = 100 loaves of bread per day.\nFrom Monday to Friday, he bakes a total of 100 x 5 = 500 loaves of bread.\nOn Saturday and Sunday, he bakes 2 x 20 = 40 loaves of bread per day.\nOn Saturday and Sunday, he bakes a total of 40 x 2 = 80 loaves of bread.\nIn a week, he bakes 500 + 80 = 580 loaves of bread.\nIn 3 weeks, he bakes 580 x 3 = 1740 loaves of bread.\n#### 1740",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 5 erroneously counts Saturday and Sunday as 1 day instead of 2 days, changing the original '40 x 2 = 80 loaves of bread' to '40 x 1 = 40 loaves of bread'. This in turn affects step 6, changing the weekly total from '500 + 80 = 580 loaves of bread' to '500 + 40 = 540 loaves of bread', and step 7, changing the 3-week total from '580 x 3 = 1740 loaves of bread' to '540 x 3 = 1620 loaves of bread'. It should be noted that only one counting error is considered, and the previous steps where the counting was correct remain unchanged.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct. The explanation is: The baker bakes 5 loaves of bread per hour, so in 1 hour, he bakes 5 x 4 = 20 loaves of bread. From Monday to Friday, he bakes 20 x 5 = 100 loaves of bread per day, and in 3 weeks, he bakes 100 x 3 = 300 loaves of bread. Therefore, the answer is 1620 loaves of bread."
