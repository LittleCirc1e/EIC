After deleting step 1, we update step 4 to exclude the $40 since it wouldn't be calculated due to the missing step 1. The updated step 4 uses the numbers from step 2 and step 3, computing $80 + $50 = $130 instead of including the additional $40 from the now-deleted step 1. This also influences step 5, changing the result for the amount needed to reach the goal from $200 - $170 = $30 to $200 - $130 = $70.

However, the problem states that each family donated $10, not $80. Therefore, the correct amount raised from each of the eight families is $8 x $10 = $80.\n\nSo, the total amount raised by Classroom A is $80 + $10 x 8 = $80 + $80 = $160.

The change leads to calculating 0 black socks instead of 6, and the remaining steps that calculate the total number of socks refer to this new value. Therefore, removing step 4 causes a fundamental miscalculation in the number of black socks, leading to the first erroneous reference at step 5 in the transformed solution. It should be noted that the number 3 from step 5, referring to how many fewer pairs of black socks there are compared to blue, remains intact as the required reference from the question.

However, an error was introduced in the transformed solution: instead of summing up the correct numbers to maintain the original answer, the total was incorrectly added as 3*7 + 42 + 56 = 133. Due to this error, the transformed answer differs from the original. The wrong_step is 3 which is the first step that has the incorrect reference in the transformed_solution.
