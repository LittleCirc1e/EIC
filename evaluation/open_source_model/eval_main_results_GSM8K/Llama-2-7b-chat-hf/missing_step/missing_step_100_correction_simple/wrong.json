        "question": "Milly is figuring out how long she needs to spend studying. She knows that her math homework will take 60 minutes. Her geography homework will take half as long as her math homework, and her science homework will take time equal to the mean amount of time she spent studying math and geography. How many minutes does Milly spend studying?",
        "original_solution": "First find how long Milly spends studying geography by dividing her math homework time by 2: 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes.\nNow find the total amount of time Milly spent on math and geography: 30 minutes + 60 minutes = 90 minutes.\nNow calculate the mean amount of time Milly spends on math and geography by dividing the total time spent by the number of subjects, which is 2: 90 minutes / 2 = 45 minutes.\nNow add the time Milly spent on all three subjects to find the total: 45 minutes + 30 minutes + 60 minutes = 135 minutes.\n#### 135",
        "original_answer": 135.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Find the total amount of time Milly spent on math and geography [combining step 1 and 2]: 60 minutes + (60 minutes / 2) = 90 minutes.\nNow calculate the mean amount of time Milly spends on math and geography by dividing the total time spent by the number of subjects, which is 2: 90 minutes / 2 = 45 minutes.\nNow add the time Milly spent on all three subjects to find the total: 45 minutes + (60 minutes / 2) + 60 minutes = 150 minutes.\n#### 150",

        "explanation": "In the transformed_solution, the original step 1 has been removed. Thus, the reference to \"30 minutes\" in the original step 2 for the time spent on geography has been removed. In the transformed_solution, the calculation that finds the time spent on geography by dividing math homework time by 2 (60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes) is integrated into step 1. Consequently, the initial calculation in step 3 of the original solution, which calculates the mean amount of time spent on math and geography, now references the recalculated total time spent on math and geography (90 minutes) from the transformed step 1. Step 2 of the transformed solution, which calculates the total study time, also integrates this change and incorrectly calculates the total study time as 150 minutes instead of the correct 135 minutes. By removing the first step, which was the calculation of the geography homework time, the subsequent steps reference the largest number from question that step 1 references, which is \"60 minutes\" for the math homework time, leading to the incorrect transformed_answer. Therefore, the wrong_step is 1.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct. The explanation is:\n\nStep 1: Milly spent 60 minutes on math homework.\nStep 2: Milly spent half as much time on geography homework, which is 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes.\nStep 3: Milly spent the mean amount of time on math and geography, which is 45 minutes.\nStep 4: Milly spent 60 minutes on science homework, which is the total time spent on all three subjects.\n\nTherefore, the total time Milly spent studying is 150 minutes."

        "original_solution": "Josh works 8 hours/day * 5 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 hours a month.\nHe earns 160 hours/month * $9/month = $1440 per month.\nCarl works less because he is an intern: 6 hours/day * 5 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 120 hours per month.\nCarl earns 120 hours * $4.5/hour = $540 per month.\nThe company pays for the 2 together: $1440 + $540 = $1980.\n#### 1980",

In the original_solution, step 3 calculates the hours Carl works per month by referencing the hours he works every day (6), which is found by subtracting 2 from the 8 hours Josh works a day in step 1. After deleting step 3, step 4 in the transformed_solution references the 160 hours from step 1 directly when calculating Carl's earnings. This simplifies Carl's monthly earnings calculation to 160 hours/month * $4.5/hour, which results in $720 per month for Carl. The transformed_solution combines steps 1 and 3 of the original_solution, assuming Carl works the same number of hours as Josh. The next step updates step 5 in the original_solution with the new combined total of $2160 instead of $1980.

She's carrying 20 crates of soda that each weigh 50 pounds, 3 dryers that each weigh 3000 pounds, and twice as much weight in fresh produce as in soda. How much does Donna's fully loaded truck weigh?",
        "original_solution": "First find the total weight of the soda by multiplying the number of crates by the weight per crate: 20 crates * 50 pounds/crate = 1000 pounds\nThen find the weight of the fresh produce by doubling the weight of the soda: 1000 pounds * 2 = 2000 pounds\nNow find the weight of the dryers by multiplying the quantity by the weight per item: 3 dryers * 3000 pounds/dryer = 9000 pounds\nNow add the empty truck's weight to the weight of all three groups of products to find the fully loaded weight: 12000 pounds + 1000 pounds + 2000 pounds + 9000 pounds = 24000 pounds\n#### 24000",

        "explanation": "Step 1 has been removed, which originally calculated the weight of the crates of soda. In the original_solution, the weight of the fresh produce was calculated in step 2 based on the result of step 1. So after deleting step 1, step 1 in the transformed_solution directly calculates the weight of the fresh produce by using the number of crates and weight per crate from the question and skips calculating the weight of soda separately, effectively doubling it to get the fresh produce's weight (2000 pounds). It then adds the transformed steps from the third step of the original solution. The weight of the soda, which is 1000 pounds, is not added in the transformed_solution, so the final transformed_answer is 23000 pounds, which results from omitting the weight of the soda. It is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also a transformation of step 2 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing incorrect number in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 1.",
        "eval_result": "\nThe solution is correct.
