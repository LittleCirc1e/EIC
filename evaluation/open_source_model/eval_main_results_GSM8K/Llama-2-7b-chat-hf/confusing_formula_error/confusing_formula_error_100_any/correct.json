The original solution correctly uses the formula for the perimeter of a square (4*side), replacing this with the area calculation formula (side*side) in the transformed solution. As a result, the original calculation for the perimeter: 4*20 = 80 cm is incorrectly changed to an area calculation: 20*20 = 400 cm, which falsely represents the perimeter of the square paper instead of its area. This error then affects step 2, where the sum calculates the height of the computer screen using the mistaken value, changing from 20+80 = 100 cm to 20+400 = 420 cm.

By changing the addition to multiplication (40*50=2000 cm), we make an error reflecting confusion between linear and area measures.
