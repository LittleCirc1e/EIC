        "original_solution": "Luis drives 80/2 = 40 miles in 1 hour.\nSince there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, then he drives 40/60 = 2/3 of a mile in 1 minute.\nSo in 15 minutes, he will go 2/3 x 15 = 10 miles far.\n#### 10",
        "original_answer": 10.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Luis drives 80/2 = 40 miles in 1 hour.\nSince there are 50 minutes in 1 hour, then he drives 40/50 = 4/5 of a mile in 1 minute.\nSo in 15 minutes, he will go 4/5 x 15 = 12 miles far.\n#### 12",

        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 2 makes an incorrect unit conversion, which changes 60 minutes in 1 hour to 50 minutes in 1 hour, resulting in 40/60 = 2/3 of a mile in 1 minute in the original_solution becoming 40/50 = 4/5 of a mile in 1 minute in the transformed_solution. It further impacted step 3, changing from 2/3 x 15 = 10 miles to 4/5 x 15 = 12 miles. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, and the calculation in step 1 remains correct.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nPlease provide your response here.\n\nPlease note that the [Solution] is incorrect, and the first wrong step is step #4, which is the calculation of 40/50. The correct calculation should be 80/60, not 40/50. Therefore, the final answer is incorrect.\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #4, and the explanation is that the calculation of 40/50 is incorrect, and the correct calculation should be 80/60."
