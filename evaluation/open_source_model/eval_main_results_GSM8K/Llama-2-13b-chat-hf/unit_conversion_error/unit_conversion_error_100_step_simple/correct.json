        "question": "It takes 1 hour for refrigerated dough to come to room temperature. It takes 15 minutes to shape the dough and 2 hours to proof. The bread takes 30 minutes to bake and 15 minutes to cool. If the bakery opens at 6:00 am, what is the latest time the head baker can make it to the store to start working?",
        "original_solution": "It takes 1 hour to bring the dough to room temp and 2 hours to proof the dough so that's 1+2 = 3 hours\nIt takes 15 minutes to shape the dough, 30 minutes to bake and another 15 minutes to cool for a total of 15+30+15 = 60 minutes\nThere are 60 minutes in 1 hour so that takes him 60/60 = 1 hour\nIn total it takes 3+1 = 4 hours from start to finish to make the bread\nIf the bakery opens at 6:00 am and it takes 4 hours to prep then the latest the head baker can show up is 6-4 = 2:00 am\n#### 2",
        "original_answer": 2.0,
        "transformed_solution": "It takes 1 hour to bring the dough to room temp and 2 hours to proof the dough so that's 1+2 = 3 hours\nIt takes 15 minutes to shape the dough, 30 minutes to bake and another 15 minutes to cool for a total of 15+30+15 = 60 minutes\nThere are 50 minutes in 1 hour so that takes him 60/50 = 1.2 hours\nIn total it takes 3+1.2 = 4.2 hours from start to finish to make the bread\nIf the bakery opens at 6:00 am and it takes 4.2 hours to prep then the latest the head baker can show up is 6-4.2 = 1:48 am\n#### 1.8",
        "transformed_answer": 1.8,
        "wrong_step": 3,
        "wrong_type": "unit_conversion_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 3 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 hour is wrongly equal to 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes, resulting in 60/60 = 1 hour in the original_solution becoming 60/50 = 1.2 hours in the transformed_solution. And it affects the subsequent related step 4, where the total time changes from 3+1 = 4 hours to 3+1.2 = 4.2 hours, and the final step 5 where the latest time the head baker can show up changes from 6-4 = 2:00 am to approximately 6-4.2 = 1:48 am (converted from decimal to time format). It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, so the other calculation processes are still correct.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #3, which is the calculation of the total time to bake and cool the bread. The explanation is that the total time to bake and cool the bread should be 30 minutes + 15 minutes = 45 minutes, not 60 minutes.\n\nThe correct solution is:\n\nIt takes 1 hour to bring the dough to room temperature and 2 hours to proof the dough, so that's 1+2 = 3 hours.\nIt takes 15 minutes to shape the dough.\nIt takes 45 minutes to bake and cool the bread.\n\nTherefore, the total time to make the bread is 3+15+45 = 63 minutes.\n\nIf the bakery opens at 6:00 am, the latest the head baker can show up is 6:00 am - 63 minutes = 5:37 am."
