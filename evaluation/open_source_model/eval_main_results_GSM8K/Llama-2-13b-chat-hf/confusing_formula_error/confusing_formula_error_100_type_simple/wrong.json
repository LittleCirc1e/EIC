The same error cascades to step 4 and ultimately changes the final weight difference in pounds from the correct answer of 150 pounds to an incorrect answer of 975.5 pounds. Each other step is based on the respective areas, but since Bob's TV is the larger TV, we actually subtract the incorrect area for Bill's TV from the correct area of Bob's TV to find the size difference.

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and volume calculations. The original_solution properly calculates the volume of the rectangular prism by multiplying the side of the square base with itself and then by the height (2*2*8), but the transformed_solution incorrectly treats the calculation as if finding the perimeter of the base (2+2+2+2). By changing the formula from volume to perimeter, the result is an incorrect volume calculation, influencing the subsequent weight calculation in step 2. As a result, the original_solution's correct volume of 32 cubic meters used to find the weight (2700*32) is erroneously transformed to an incorrect volume of 8 cubic meters (2+2+2+2) and the subsequent incorrect weight (2700*8). It's important to note that only step 1 has been modified to introduce the confusing formula error, affecting the related step 2, while no language description has been changed.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nPlease select the correct answer from the following options:\n\nA) The solution is correct, and the explanation is: The correct calculation of the volume of the marble statue using the formula V = l x w x h, where l = 2 meters, w = 2 meters, and h = 8 meters.\n\nB) The solution is incorrect, the wrong type is: calculation_error, and the explanation is: The weight of the marble statue should be calculated using the formula W = ρ x V, where ρ is the density of the marble, and V is the volume of the marble statue. The density of the marble is 2700 kg/m3, not 2700 kg/cm3.\n\nC) The solution is incorrect, the wrong type is: referencing_context_value_error, and the explanation is: The formula for the weight of the marble statue should be W = ρ x V, not W = ρ x l x w x h.\n\nD"
