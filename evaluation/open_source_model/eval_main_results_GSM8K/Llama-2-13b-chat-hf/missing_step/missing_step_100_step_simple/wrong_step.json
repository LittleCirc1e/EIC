        "question": "Marcus has received a commission for as many paintings as possible. Marcus plans out his drawings so that his client can receive some of the paintings as soon as possible but it is still going to take a long time. On the first day, he paints 2 paintings. He then paints every day and each day, he paints twice as many paintings as he painted the day before. If he paints for 5 days, how many paintings will he have painted in total?",
        "original_solution": "If Marcus creates 2 paintings on the first day, then he can paint 2 paintings * 2 = 4 paintings on the 2nd day.\nSo he paints 4 paintings * 2 = 8 paintings on the 3rd day.\nHe then paints 8 paintings * 2 = 16 paintings on the 4th day.\nAnd finally paints 16 paintings * 2 = 32 paintings on the 5th day.\nMarcus therefore has painted a total of 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 paintings.\n#### 62",
        "original_answer": 62.0,
        "transformed_solution": "So Marcus paints 2 paintings * 2 = 4 paintings on the 2nd day.\nHe then paints 4 paintings * 2 = 8 paintings on the 3rd day.\nHe then paints 8 paintings * 2 = 16 paintings on the 4th day.\nAnd finally paints 16 paintings * 2 = 32 paintings on the 5th day.\nMarcus therefore has painted a total of 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 paintings.\n#### 124",

        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this transformation, the first step has been removed. Since the first step is missing, we need to adjust the final summation step (original Step 5) to compensate for this removal. The original solution went through 5 steps to show the progression of paintings from Day 1 to Day 5. By removing the first day's 2 paintings and not adjusting the final sum to account for this absence, it results in an error in calculation. Specifically, the final sum should still be 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 as in the original solution. However, in the transformed step, the summation incorrectly doubles the calculated total to 124, which becomes the transformed_answer. Therefore, the wrong_step is the last remaining one (number 5 in the sequence of steps that have not been deleted), as it improperly adjusts for the missing step and incorrectly doubles the total count, showing a calculation error.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #4, which is the calculation of 8 paintings * 2 = 16 paintings on the 4th day.\n\nThe explanation is that Marcus paints 2 paintings on the first day, then he paints 2 times 2 = 4 paintings on the second day, not 8 paintings. Therefore, the correct calculation for the 4th day should be 2 + 2 = 4 paintings, not 8 paintings.\n\nThe correct total number of paintings Marcus will have painted in 5 days is:\n\n2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 16 paintings.\n\nTherefore, the answer is #16."

        "question": "Andy walks 50 meters from his house to school. After school, he comes back to the house and goes to the market. If he walks 140 meters in total, how many meters is the distance between the house and the market?",
        "original_solution": "He walks 50m from home to school and walks 50m again from school to house, so he walks 50m + 50m = 100 meters\nIf the total distance is 140m, the distance between the house and the market is 140m - 100m = 40 meters.\n#### 40",
        "original_answer": 40.0,
        "transformed_solution": "If the total distance is 140m, the distance between the house and the market is 140m - 50m = 90 meters.\n#### 90",

        "wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "missing_step",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "In this transformation, I have deleted the first step, which involves Andy's return trip from school to his house. The original step 1 involves adding the two 50m trips together for a total of 100m. By removing this step, we no longer account for the return trip from school, and thus the calculation in the transformed solution refers to only one leg of the journey from the house to the school (50m). Since in our transformation we remove step 1, we then modify step 2 to include only one 50m trip, changing the formula from 140m - 100m = 40 meters to 140m - 50m = 90 meters. It should be noted that while the calculation itself is algebraically correct, the premise is wrong because it does not consider the entire trip. The first step (now also the wrong_step) references the correct number from the question and no intermediate steps are present, thus making the entire reasoning incorrect and leading to a different transformed answer.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nPlease provide your response here.\n\nPlease note that the solution provided is incorrect. The first mistake occurs in step #3, where the distance between the house and the market is calculated as 140m - 50m = 90m. However, the correct calculation should be 140m - 50m = 90m + 50m = 140m, as the distance between the house and the market is not just the distance between the house and the school. Therefore, the correct answer is 140m.\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #3, and the explanation is that the correct calculation should be 140m - 50m = 90m + 50m = 140m."

        "original_solution": "Since Marlon spent half of the gift card, then half of it which is $200/2 = $100 remained on Monday.\nThen on Tuesday, he spent $100/4 = $25.\nTherefore, he has $100 - $25 = $75 left in his gift card.\n#### 75",

        "explanation": "Here, step 1 has been removed. In the original_solution, step 1 references the number 200 from the question, and step 2 references the result 100 from step 1. So after deleting step 1, step 2 should change the result of 100, which is the remainder on Monday, to a direct calculation from the original 200 by spending one-fourth on Tuesday, which is calculated as $200/4 = $50. The following step (now step 2 in the transformed_solution), which originally calculated the final amount after spending on Tuesday, needs to be updated to account for only the initial amount and the Tuesday spending. The correct depletion of funds would be the initial $200 minus half spent on Monday ($100) and the quarter of the remainder spent on Tuesday ($50), leaving $50, so the formula changes to $200 - $100 - $50. The wrong_step is 1 in the transformed_solution, as it is the first step referencing the incorrect number in the transformed_solution.",

The correct explanation is that one-fourth of the remainder should be calculated after the first spend of half of the gift card, not before. Therefore, the correct solution is $200 - $100 - $50 = $50, not $50.\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #4, and the explanation is #5."

But after eating just one of the cookies, he felt guilty about it and put the other two cookies back. His son, Louie Junior saw that his Dad was eating cookies. So, Louie Junior took seven cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom for later. The next morning, Debra, Lou's wife looked into the cookie jar and reacted by accusing her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the cookie jar. How many cookies remained in the jar?",
        "original_solution": "Lou Sr took 3 cookies from the jar, then another three, but then put two back, for a total of 3+3-2=4 cookies removed.\nLouie Jr took seven more out of the jar, for a total of 4+7=11 cookies removed.\nIf Debra thought half were gone, then the number of missing cookies would equal the number of cookies that remain, or 11 missing=11 remaining cookies\n#### 11",

        "explanation": "In the original_solution, step 1 calculates the total number of cookies removed by Lou Sr by combining actions from two days, but step 1 can be seen as two distinct actions. To transform the solution, step 1 is modified by considering only the second action, removing the first day's 3 cookies resulting in 3-2=1 cookie removed. This initial action is directly taken from the question. The second step then changes accordingly, adding only the remaining cookies from day two plus the 7 from Louie Jr, resulting in 1+7=8 cookies removed. The last step remains valid as the logic still applies that the missing number of cookies equals those remaining. Thus, the first incorrect reference becomes the new step 1, replacing \"3+3-2=4\" with \"3-2=1\", reflecting only the second day's action. The removal of the first day's action causes the transformed_answer to be different from the original_answer which is necessary for the case generation process.",

The correct calculation should be 7 cookies removed, not 1+7=8 cookies removed.\n\nThe explanation is that Louie Junior took 7 cookies out of the jar, not 1 cookie as stated in the solution. This mistake leads to the incorrect final answer of 8 missing cookies, instead of the correct answer of 7 missing cookies."

He realizes first he has to get in shape to do it and it takes him 2 years of working out to get healthy enough to take up mountain climbing. He then spends twice that long learning how to be a technically proficient mountain climber. After that he starts with the simplest mountain on the list and climbs them all.

How much time did it take to get through all these goals?",

Step 4 of the original_solution, which references the result '4 years' from the deleted Step 1, gets modified. The time spent preparing and learning to dive (2 years + 13 months) remains unaltered. However, since step 1 was removed, the total years cannot include the 4 years from the removed step. The new calculation in the transformed_solution should be the initial 2 years of working out, plus 4 years of mountaineering (calculated from the 48 months), plus 2 years of diving education, plus 2 years of actual diving, equaling 10 years in total. As per guidance given, the transformed solution has one less step compared to the original solution, and the wrong_step is the first one after the deletion that makes reference to the previous calculation ('2+4+4+2=12 years' changes to '2+4+2+2=10 years'), which is transformed step 4.",
