        "transformed_solution": "The reseller wants to get $3000 x 15/100 = $450 profit. Because she provides premium packaging which costs $50, the total cost increases to $3050.\nThus, she needs to sell it for $3050 + $450 = $3500.\n#### 3500",

This affects step 2, changing the sum from $3000 + $450 to $3050 + $450. The transformed_answer is thus changed to $3500. It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct.",

The total cost includes the cost of the bag and the premium packaging, so the reseller should sell the bag for $3000 + $450 = $3450, not $3500."
