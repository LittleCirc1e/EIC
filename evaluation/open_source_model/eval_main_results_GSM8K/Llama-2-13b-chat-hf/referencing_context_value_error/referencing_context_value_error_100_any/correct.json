Step 3 changes from adding $9 to the initial $90 to adding $13.5, and step 4 changes from subtracting $99 from $140 to subtracting $103.5 from $140.

        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #1. The calculation of the taxes paid is incorrect. The taxes paid should be calculated as $90 \\* 10% = $9, not $13.5. Therefore, the total bill before gratuities is $90 + $9 = $99, not $103.5.\n\nThe correct calculation of the gratuities is $140 - $99 = $41, not $36.5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #1.
