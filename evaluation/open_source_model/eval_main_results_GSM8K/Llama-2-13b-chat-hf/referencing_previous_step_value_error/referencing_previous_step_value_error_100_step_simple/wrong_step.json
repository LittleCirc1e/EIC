        "question": "Louise is an artist and needs to apply a coat of varnish to her latest paintings. Usually it takes 7 minutes for the coat of varnish to dry on one painting. However, today she is using a new varnish and it takes 12 minutes for the coat to dry. How much longer will it take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish?",
        "original_solution": "Usually, the varnish on all 6 paintings would be dry in 7*6=42 minutes\nWith the new varnish, all 6 paintings would be dry in 12*6=72 minutes\nWith the new varnish, it will take 72-42=30 more minutes\n#### 30",
        "original_answer": 30.0,
        "transformed_solution": "Usually, the varnish on all 6 paintings would be dry in 7*6=42 minutes\nWith the new varnish, all 6 paintings would be dry in 12*6=72 minutes\nWith the new varnish, it will take 72-40=32 more minutes\n#### 32",
        "transformed_answer": 32.0,
        "wrong_step": 3,
        "wrong_type": "referencing_previous_step_value_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 3 mistakenly references 42 as 40 from step 1 and changes 72-42=30 more minutes to 72-40=32 more minutes. It should be noted that step 1 in the transformed_solution <Usually, the varnish on all 6 paintings would be dry in 7*6=42 minutes> should be the same as the step 1 in the original_solution <Usually, the varnish on all 6 paintings would be dry in 7*6=42 minutes> and calculates its result 42 correctly. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all steps is still correct.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #4, which must be an integer, and the explanation is #, which is your explanation about why the [Solution] is incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is 32 more minutes. However, the solution provided by the student is incorrect because they have added the total time for all 6 paintings to be dry with the new varnish (72 minutes) to the total time for all 6 paintings to be dry with the old varnish (40 minutes), which is not the correct way to calculate the difference. The correct way to calculate the difference is to subtract the total time for all 6 paintings to be dry with the old varnish from the total time for all 6 paintings to be dry with the new varnish. Therefore, the correct answer is 32 more minutes, not 72 minutes."

        "question": "Rebecca bought 2 pies for the holiday weekend.  Each pie was sliced into 8 slices.  Rebecca ate 1 slice of each pie.  Her family and friends ate 50% of the remaining pies over the weekend.  On Sunday evening Rebecca and her husband each had another slice of pie.  How many slices are remaining?",
        "original_solution": "She bought 2 pies that had 8 slices each for a total of 2*8 = 16 slices\nRebecca ate 2 of the 16 slices leaving 16-2 =14 slices\nHer family and friends at 50% of the pie so they ate 14*.50 = 7 slices\nThere were 14 slices and her family and friends ate 7 slices so that leaves 14-7 = 7 slices\nSunday night Rebecca and her husband each had a slice from the remaining slices so that leaves 7-2 = 5 slices\n#### 5",
        "original_answer": 5.0,
        "transformed_solution": "She bought 2 pies that had 8 slices each for a total of 2*8 = 16 slices\nRebecca ate 2 of the 16 slices leaving 16-2 =14 slices\nHer family and friends at 50% of the pie so they ate 14*.50 = 7 slices\nThere were 14 slices and her family and friends ate 7 slices so that leaves 14-7 = 7 slices\nSunday night Rebecca and her husband each had a slice from the remaining slices so that leaves 7-3 = 4 slices\n#### 4",

        "wrong_type": "referencing_previous_step_value_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Step 5 mistakenly references the number of slices that Rebecca and her husband ate on Sunday night. Instead of eating 1 slice each which would be 2 slices total, the mistaken transformation assumes they ate a total of 3 slices. The modified step shows 7-3 = 4 slices remaining instead of 7-2 = 5 slices. It should be noted that the original steps leading to the number of remaining slices should remain the same, specifically step 4 in the transformed solution <There were 14 slices and her family and friends ate 7 slices so that leaves 14-7 = 7 slices> should match the original solution step. All subsequent steps properly reference the erroneous number from the previous step, such that the calculations are correct given the new, though incorrect, premise.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #3, which must be an integer, and the explanation is #, which is your explanation about why the [Solution] is incorrect.\n\nThe error in step #3 is that Rebecca and her husband each had another slice of pie on Sunday evening, but this is not accounted for in the calculation. The correct calculation should be:\n\nRebecca ate 2 slices, leaving 16 - 2 = 14 slices\nHer family and friends ate 50% of the remaining slices, which is 50% of 14 = 7 slices\nThere were 14 slices and her family and friends ate 7 slices, so that leaves 14 - 7 = 7 slices\nSunday night Rebecca and her husband each had another slice, but this is already accounted for in the previous step, so the correct answer is 7 slices remaining.\n\nTherefore, the solution is incorrect, and the first wrong step is step #3."
