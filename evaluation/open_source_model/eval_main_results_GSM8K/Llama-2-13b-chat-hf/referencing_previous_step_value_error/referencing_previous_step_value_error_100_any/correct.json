The transformed_step (Step 3) calculates the stop signs per mile based on the erroneous count of stop signs from step 2, but still calculates the division correctly; the result of 13/7 is 1.85714285714. Only the initial error of miscounting the stop signs is introduced, all other calculations then follow from that initial error.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #1.\n\nThe solution incorrectly assumes that the number of stop signs encountered is directly proportional to the distance traveled. However, the problem statement states that Rudolph encountered 3 less than 17 stop signs, which means that the actual number of stop signs encountered is 17-3=14.\n\nTo calculate the number of stop signs per mile, we need to divide the number of stop signs by the distance traveled. In this case, we have 14 stop signs and 7 miles, so the calculation is 14/7=2 stop signs per mile.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 2 stop signs per mile, not 1.85714285714."
