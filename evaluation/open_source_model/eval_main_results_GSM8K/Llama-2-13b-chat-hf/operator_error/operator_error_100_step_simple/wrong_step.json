        "question": "In a set of magicians cards, there are 15 red cards, and 60% more green cards. Yellow cards are as many, as the sum of red and green cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?",
        "original_solution": "There are 60/100 * 15 = 9 more green cards than red cards.\nWhich means there are 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.\nYellow cards make up to 15 + 24 = 39 cards.\nSo in total, there are 39 + 39 = 78 cards of different colors.\n#### 78",

        "explanation": "The example changes the addition in the second step of the calculation to subtraction by turning the correct form '15 + 9 = 24' into '15 - 9 = 6', thus showing an incorrect number of green cards. This logically affects the related subsequent steps. The next step incorrectly calculates the number of yellow cards (now the sum is 15 + 6 = 21), and the final total is incorrectly calculated as 21 + 21 = 42 cards. It should be noted that the operator is only incorrect in the second step with the calculation correctly made based on the incorrect operator, leading to incorrect results for the subsequent figures that rely on it.",

The correct calculation is 15 + 6 = 21, not 21 + 21 = 42. Therefore, the final answer is incorrect."

Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?",
