        "question": "If a vehicle is driven 12 miles on Monday, 18 miles on Tuesday, and 21 miles on Wednesday. What is the average distance traveled per day?",
        "original_solution": "The total distance covered from Monday to Wednesday is 12 + 18 + 21 = 51 miles.\nSo the average distance traveled per day is 51/3 = 17 miles.\n#### 17",
        "original_answer": 17.0,
        "transformed_solution": "The total distance covered from Monday to Wednesday is 12 + 18 + 21 = 51 miles.\nThe average distance traveled per day is counted as 51/2 = 25.5 miles because Wednesday is mistakenly excluded.\n#### 25.5",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 erroneously assumes the total distance covered should be divided by 2 days instead of 3, which means Wednesday is mistakenly excluded. Hence the average 51/3=17 changes to 51/2=25.5. The error is isolated to the counting of the number of days, and the previous step regarding the calculation of total distance remains unaffected.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #2. The reason is that the calculation only includes two days, Monday and Tuesday, and Wednesday is excluded. Therefore, the average distance traveled per day is calculated as (12 + 18) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15 miles, not 25.5 miles."

        "original_solution": "On Tuesday, Tristan studies twice as long as he did on Monday and this amounts to 4 hours * 2 = 8 hours.\nSo in the first 5 days of the week, he studies for a total of 4 hours Monday + 8 hours Tuesday + 3 hours Wednesday + 3 hours Thursday + 3 hours Friday = 21 hours.\nHe therefore has 25 planned hours – 21 used hours = 4 hours left to study.\nAs he splits his time evenly over 2 days, he spends 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours studying on Saturday.\n#### 2",

The mistake results in Tristan spending all 4 remaining hours on Saturday as opposed to dividing them evenly between Saturday and Sunday. This counting error affects only the final step related to the allocation of study hours over the weekend and the subsequent calculation of hours studied on Saturday, without affecting previous or unrelated steps.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, and the explanation is #3. The mistake in the solution is that Tristan studies for 8 hours on Tuesday, but he only studies for 3 hours on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Therefore, the total number of hours Tristan studies in the first 5 days of the week is 4 hours Monday + 3 hours Tuesday + 3 hours Wednesday + 3 hours Thursday + 3 hours Friday = 15 hours, not 21 hours as calculated in the solution.\n\nTherefore, Tristan has 25 planned hours – 15 used hours = 10 hours left to study.
