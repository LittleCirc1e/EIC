        "original_solution": "Let x be the number of books in Susan's collection.\nThe collection of both Susan and Lidia would then be 4*x + x = 3000.\n5*x = 3000\nx = 600\n#### 600",

        "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates the final step, 3000 / 5 as 500 instead of the correct 600. The error is only in the final calculation step, so the previous steps do not need to be altered. The transformed solution must consistently reflect the single error introduced and leads to the final erroneous transformed answer.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nPlease provide your response here.\n\nPlease note that the [Solution] is incorrect, and the first wrong step is step #4, which is the step where the mistake occurs. The explanation is that the equation 5*x = 3000 should be 4*x + x = 3000, as the collection of both Susan and Lidia is four times bigger than Susan's collection, not five times bigger. Therefore, the correct answer is 250, not 500.\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #4, and the explanation is that the equation 5*x = 3000 should be 4*x + x = 3000. Therefore, the correct answer is 250, not 500."
