        "question": "A pet store owner had 12 birds, 9 puppies, 5 cats, and 15 spiders. Half the birds were sold and 3 puppies were adopted. Then, someone left the spider enclosure open and 7 of them went loose. How many animals does the pet store owner have left?",
        "original_solution": "There are 12/2 = 6 birds left.\nThere are 9-3 = 6 puppies left.\nThere are 15 - 7 = 8 spiders left.\nThe pet store owner has 5 + 6 + 6 + 8 = 25 animals left\n#### 25",

        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "The example changes the calculation result of the number of spiders left in step 3 from 15 - 7 = 8 to an incorrect value of 15 - 7 = 6, which is the wrong step. This error is propagated to step 4, affecting the total count calculation without changing the structure of the step (no operand or operator is changed); the new incorrect total is calculated as 5 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 23 instead of 5 + 6 + 6 + 8 = 25. All other steps and their calculations remain unchanged.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 21, and the explanation is as follows:\n\nIn the solution, the number of birds is calculated as 12/2 = 6, which is correct. However, the number of puppies is calculated as 9-3 = 6, which should be 9-3 = 6. The correct answer for the number of puppies is 6, not 6.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer for the total number of animals the pet store owner has is 5 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 21, not 23."
