        "original_solution": "The total time taken for the whole journey is 9:00-6:00 = 3 hours.\nThe total time taken in minutes is 3*60 = 180 minutes.\nIf it takes 40 minutes to reach the first station, then the rest of the journey takes 180 - 40 = 140 minutes.\n#### 140",

        "explanation": "In the transformed solution, step 3 has been altered from \"180 - 40 = 140 minutes\" to \"180 - 40 = 130 minutes.\" This is a calculation error affecting only this step. The preceding steps remain unchanged, as they are not dependent on the outcome of step 3. The transformation process involves making a single calculation error in step 3, which leads to a different transformed_answer from the original_answer.",
        "eval_result": "\n\nThe solution is incorrect, the wrong type is 'calculation_error', and the explanation is as follows:\n\nThe total time taken for the whole journey is 9:00-6:00 = 3 hours, which is correct. However, the total time taken in minutes is calculated as 3*60 = 180 minutes, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should be 3*60 = 1800 minutes, not 180 minutes.\n\nThe rest of the journey takes 1800 - 40 = 1760 minutes, not 130 minutes. Therefore, the final answer should be 1760 minutes, not "
