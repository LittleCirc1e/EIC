Step 3 accordingly changes from 40/4=10 to 35/4=8.75 to take into account the erroneous total given away. All changes only affect the steps after the error, while the step before the error, which is step 1 in this case, remains unaffected. The wrong calculation result in step 2 is carried through to the subsequent step, modifying both the operands used in the calculation and the explanatory text, but the calculation process within each step is performed correctly.",
