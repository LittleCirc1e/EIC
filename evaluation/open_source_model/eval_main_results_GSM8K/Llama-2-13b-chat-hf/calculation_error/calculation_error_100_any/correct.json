The correct calculation should be done for each additional 100 people added to the spaceship.\n\nFor the first 100 people added, the speed is halved to 250 km/hr, as calculated in the solution. For the next 100 people added, the speed is halved again to 125 km/hr (not 100 km/hr as calculated in the solution).
