The living room takes as long as the 3 bedrooms combined. The bathroom takes twice as long as the living room. He also cleans the outside which takes twice as long as cleaning the house. He splits the chores with his 2 siblings who are just as fast as him. How long, in hours, does he work?", "original_solution": "It takes 3*20=60 minutes to clean the living room\nSo it is 60/60=1 hour\nThe bathroom takes 1*2=2 hours\nSo all together the inside takes 1+1+2=4 hours\nThe outside takes 4*2=8 hours\nSo the chores take 4+8=12 hours\nHe splits it 1+2=3 ways\nSo he works 12/3=4 hours\n#### 4", "original_answer": 4.0, "transformed_solution": "It takes 3*20=60 minutes to clean the living room\nSo it is 60/60=1 hour\nThe bathroom takes 1*2=2 hours\nSo all together the inside takes 1+1+2=4 hours\nThe outside takes 4*2=8 hours\nSo the chores take 4+8=10 hours\nHe splits it 1+2=3 ways\nSo he works 10/3=3.33 hours\n#### 3.33", "transformed_answer": 3.33, "wrong_step": 8, "wrong_type": "calculation_error", "is_single_error": true, "explanation": "In this case, the value in step 6 was changed from 4+8=12 hours to 4+8=10 hours, which is incorrect and represents a calculation error. All steps following this incorrect calculation inherit the error, but all steps prior are not affected. Step 7 remains the same because it does not rely on the incorrect total. Step 8 changes from 12/3=4 hours to 10/3=3.33 hours and thus changes the answer to 3.33 instead of the original 4."}
{"question": "A shop is offering a discount on pens. If you buy 10 pens at the regular price, you can get the next 10 for half off. A customer came in and bought 20 pens for $30. What's the regular price of one pen in dollars?", "original_solution": "Let p be the cost of a full-priced pen.\nWe know that the first 10 pens are sold at the regular price, so they cost 10*p.\nWe also know the any pens purchased after the first 10 are half-price, so they cost (20 pens - 10 pens) * p/2 on those.\nIf we add the cost of the first 10 pens and the pens sold at half-price it equals the total purchase of price of $30=10*p + (20-10)*p/2.\nThus, $30 = 10*p + 10 * p/2.\nAnd, $30 = 10 *p + 5*p.\nSo, $30 = 15* p.\nFinally, p=$2.\n#### 2", "original_answer": 2.0, "transformed_solution": "Let p be the cost of a full-priced pen.\nWe know that the first 10 pens are sold at the regular price, so they cost 10*p.\nWe also know the any pens purchased after the first 10 are half-price, so they cost (20 pens - 10 pens) * p/2 on those.\nIf we add the cost of the first 10 pens and the pens sold at half-price it equals the total purchase of price of $30=10*p + (20-10)*p/2.\nThus, $30 = 10*p + 10 * p/2.\nAnd, $30 = 10 *p + 5*p.\nSo, $30 = 15* p.\nFinally, p=$1.90.\n#### 1.90", "transformed_answer": 1.9, "wrong_step": 8, "wrong_type": "calculation_error", "is_single_error": true, "explanation": "In the transformed solution, only the calculation result in the final step (step 8) is changed to p=$1.90, resulting in a transformed_answer that is different from the original_answer. This change does not affect the formula in any of the steps leading to step 8, meaning all the formulas used up to step 7 are correct and the inputs used within those formulas also remain correct. This error is a clear deviation from the correct calculations and affects only the result in the final step without altering any operands or operators in the formula itself."}
{"question": "June is running for class president. She needs just over 50% of the vote to win. There are 200 students in the school. 60% of students are boys and the rest are girls. If she receives 67.5% of the male vote, what is the smallest percentage of the female she must receive to win the election?", "original_solution": "50% of the vote is 100 votes because 200 x .5 = 100\nJust over 50% is 101 votes because 100 + 1 = 101\n120 students are boys because 200 x .6 = 120\n80 students are girls because 200 - 120 = 80\nShe gets 81 votes from boys because 120 x .675 = 81\nShe needs 20 votes from girls because 101 - 81 = 20\nShe needs a proportion of .25 of girl's votes to win because 20 / 80 = .25\nThe percentage she needs is 25 because 100 x .25 = 25\n#### 25", "original_answer": 25.0, "transformed_solution": "50% of the vote is 100 votes because 200 x .5 = 100\nJust over 50% is 101 votes because 100 + 1 = 101\n120 students are boys because 200 x .6 = 120\n80 students are girls because 200 - 120 = 80\nShe gets 81 votes from boys because 120 x .675 = 81\nShe needs 20 votes from girls because 101 - 81 = 20\nShe needs a proportion of .25 of girl's votes to win because 20 / 80 = .25\nThe percentage she needs is 24 because 100 x .25 = 24\n#### 24", "transformed_answer": 24.0, "wrong_step": 8, "wrong_type": "calculation_error", "is_single_error": true, "explanation": "The original step 8 calculated the percentage 100 x .25 = 25 correctly, but to introduce an error, we change the product of 100 and .25 to 24.

This incorrect calculation means the transformed answer changes from 25% to 24%, which is different from the original answer. The relevant steps beforehand (1 to 7) remain unaffected by this alteration because they are not dependent on the calculation performed in step 8. The error type is a 'calculation_error' because the error is a simple math mistake, and 'is_single_error' is true as we're introducing only one error into the solution."}
