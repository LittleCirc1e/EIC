The correct calculation would be $16640 - $3640 = $13000, but to introduce an error, this calculation is changed to $16640 - $3640 = $13050. This error then affects the final amount Thomas still needs, changing the correct value of $2000 to an incorrect value of $1950. Steps 1-5 and 7 are not affected by the introduced error in step 6, ensuring that only one step is intentionally calculated incorrectly to demonstrate the process of affecting subsequent related steps."}
{"question": "A local school is holding a food drive.  Mark brings in 4 times as many cans as Jaydon.  Jaydon brings in 5 more than twice the amount of cans that Rachel brought in.  If there are 135 cans total, how many cans did Mark bring in?", "original_solution": "Let x represent the number of cans Rachel brought in.\nJaydon:5+2x\nMark:4(5+2x)=20+8x\nTotal:x+5+2x+20+8x=135\n11x+25=135\n11x=110\nx=10\nMark: 20+8(10)=100 cans\n#### 100", "original_answer": 100.0, "transformed_solution": "Let x represent the number of cans Rachel brought in.\nJaydon:5+2x\nMark:4(5+2x)=20+8x\nTotal:x+5+2x+20+8x=135\n11x+25=135\n11x=110\nx=10\nMark: 20+8(10)=90 cans\n#### 90", "transformed_answer": 90.0, "wrong_step": 6, "wrong_type": "calculation_error", "is_single_error": true, "explanation": "This example mistakenly calculates 20+8(10)=90 cans instead of 20+8(10)=100 cans in step 6, resulting in the subsequent step 7 (which is the answer) being affected as well. Step 7 incorrectly evaluates the result of the expression as 90 cans instead of 100 cans. The modification in step 6 does not affect the prior steps 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 because the error is introduced at step 6 and only affects the steps that directly depend on its result."}
{"question": "James does chores around the class.  There are 3 bedrooms, 1 living room, and 2 bathrooms to clean.  The bedrooms each take 20 minutes to clean.  The living room takes as long as the 3 bedrooms combined.  The bathroom takes twice as long as the living room.  He also cleans the outside which takes twice as long as cleaning the house.  He splits the chores with his 2 siblings who are just as fast as him.  How long, in hours, does he work?", "original_solution": "It takes 3*20=60 minutes to clean the living room\nSo it is 60/60=1 hour\nThe bathroom takes 1*2=2 hours\nSo all together the inside takes 1+1+2=4 hours\nThe outside takes 4*2=8 hours\nSo the chores take 4+8=12 hours\nHe splits it 1+2=3 ways\nSo he works 12/3=4 hours\n#### 4", "original_answer": 4.0, "transformed_solution": "It takes 3*20=60 minutes to clean the living room\nSo it is 60/60=1 hour\nThe bathroom takes 1*2=2 hours\nSo all together the inside takes 1+1+2=4 hours\nThe outside takes 4*2=7 hours\nSo the chores take 4+7=11 hours\nHe splits it 1+2=3 ways\nSo he works 11/3=3.67 hours\n#### 3.67", "transformed_answer": 3.67, "wrong_step": 6, "wrong_type": "calculation_error", "is_single_error": true, "explanation": "The transformed solution mistakenly calculates the time it takes to clean the outside as 4*2=7 hours instead of the correct 4*2=8 hours in step 6. As a consequence, step 7 changes the total number of hours needed for all chores from 4+8=12 to 4+7=11. This change affects the calculation in step 8, where the number of hours he works is recalculated based on the new total hours from step 7, resulting in 11/3=3.67 hours instead of the original 12/3=4. Previous and unrelated steps to the sixth step remain unchanged, while subsequent related steps inherit the error but the calculation itself is correct for each step."}
{"question": "A shop is offering a discount on pens. If you buy 10 pens at the regular price, you can get the next 10 for half off. A customer came in and bought 20 pens for $30. What's the regular price of one pen in dollars?", "original_solution": "Let p be the cost of a full-priced pen.\nWe know that the first 10 pens are sold at the regular price, so they cost 10*p.\nWe also know the any pens purchased after the first 10 are half-price, so they cost (20 pens - 10 pens) * p/2 on those.\nIf we add the cost of the first 10 pens and the pens sold at half-price it equals the total purchase of price of $30=10*p + (20-10)*p/2.\nThus, $30 = 10*p + 10 * p/2.\nAnd, $30 = 10 *p + 5*p.\nSo, $30 = 15* p.\nFinally, p=$2.\n#### 2", "original_answer": 2.0, "transformed_solution": "Let p be the cost of a full-priced pen.\nWe know that the first 10 pens are sold at the regular price, so they cost 10*p.\nWe also know the any pens purchased after the first 10 are half-price, so they cost (20 pens - 10 pens) * p/2 on those.\nIf we add the cost of the first 10 pens and the pens sold at half-price it equals the total purchase of price of $30=10*p + (20-10)*p/2.\nThus, $30 = 10*p + 10 * p/2.\nAnd, $30 = 10 *p + 5*p.\nSo, $30 = 15* p.\nFinally, p=$1.50.\n#### 1.50", "transformed_answer": 1.5, "wrong_step": 6, "wrong_type": "calculation_error", "is_single_error": true, "explanation": "In this case, the error is introduced in step 6 by incorrectly solving the equation $30 = 15 * p, resulting in a final price of $1.50 instead of $2.00. The rest of the solution remains correct in its setup, but the final calculation is off due to the error at wrong_step 6. Thus, steps 1 through 5 remain unaffected by the error introduced in the calculation in step 6."}
{"question": "June is running for class president. She needs just over 50% of the vote to win. There are 200 students in the school. 60% of students are boys and the rest are girls. If she receives 67.5% of male vote, what is the smallest percentage of the female she must receive to win the election?", "original_solution": "50% of the vote is 100 votes because 200 x .5 = 100\nJust over 50% is 101 votes because 100 + 1 = 101\n120 students are boys because 200 x .6 = 120\n80 students are girls because 200 - 120 = 80\nShe gets 81 votes from boys because 120 x .675 = 81\nShe needs 20 votes from girls because 101 - 81 = 20\nShe needs a proportion of .25 of girl's votes to win because 20 / 80 = .25\nThe percentage she needs is 25 because 100 x .25 = 25\n#### 25", "original_answer": 25.0, "transformed_solution": "50% of the vote is 100 votes because 200 x .5 = 100\nJust over 50% is 101 votes because 100 + 1 = 101\n120 students are boys because 200 x .6 = 120\n80 students are girls because 200 - 120 = 80\nShe gets 81 votes from boys because 120 x .675 = 81\nShe needs 21 votes from girls because 101 - 81 = 20\nShe needs a proportion of .2625 of girl's votes to win because 21 / 80 = .2625\nThe percentage she needs is 26.25 because 100 x .2625 = 26.25\n#### 26.25", "transformed_answer": 26.25, "wrong_step": 6, "wrong_type": "calculation_error", "is_single_error": true, "explanation": "In this case, changing the calculation result of the sixth step was accomplished by adjusting the value \"She needs 20 votes from girls\" to \"She needs 21 votes from girls\" to introduce a calculation error.

The step that calculates the percentage of the female vote she needs is also therefore affected and moves from 25% to 26.25%. The error is not introduced by changing operators or operands but by changing the outcome number to create a single calculation error."}
