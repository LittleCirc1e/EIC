The living room takes as long as the 3 bedrooms combined. The bathroom takes twice as long as the living room. He also cleans the outside which takes twice as long as cleaning the house. He splits the chores with his 2 siblings who are just as fast as him. How long, in hours, does he work?", "original_solution": "It takes 3*20=60 minutes to clean the living room\nSo it is 60/60=1 hour\nThe bathroom takes 1*2=2 hours\nSo all together the inside takes 1+1+2=4 hours\nThe outside takes 4*2=8 hours\nSo the chores take 4+8=12 hours\nHe splits it 1+2=3 ways\nSo he works 12/3=4 hours\n#### 4", "original_answer": 4.0, "transformed_solution": "It takes 3*20=60 minutes to clean the living room\nSo it is 60/60=1 hour\nThe bathroom takes 1*2=2 hours\nSo all together the inside takes 1+1+2=4 hours\nThe outside takes 4*2=6 hours\nSo the chores take 4+6=10 hours\nHe splits it 1+2=3 ways\nSo he works 10/3=3.333 hours\n#### 3.333", "transformed_answer": 3.333, "wrong_step": 7, "wrong_type": "calculation_error", "is_single_error": true, "explanation": "In the transformed solution, step 7 incorrectly presents the outside chore time as 4*2=6 hours instead of the original 4*2=8 hours. This is a deliberate calculation error made to generate the transformed solution. The subsequent step 8, where the total time is calculated, will inherit this error, resulting in a change in both the formula and its computed value. The unrelated steps prior to step 7 remain unchanged. By dividing the incorrect total chore time of 10 hours by 3, step 9 incorrectly calculates the work hours James spends as 10/3=3.333 hours instead of the original 12/3=4 hours. The calculation of the division itself in step 9 is correct but uses the incorrect total time from step 7."}
{"question": "A shop is offering a discount on pens. If you buy 10 pens at the regular price, you can get the next 10 for half off. A customer came in and bought 20 pens for $30. What's the regular price of one pen in dollars?", "original_solution": "Let p be the cost of a full-priced pen.\nWe know that the first 10 pens are sold at the regular price, so they cost 10*p.\nWe also know the any pens purchased after the first 10 are half-price, so they cost (20 pens - 10 pens) * p/2 on those.\nIf we add the cost of the first 10 pens and the pens sold at half-price it equals the total purchase of price of $30=10*p + (20-10)*p/2.\nThus, $30 = 10*p + 10 * p/2.\nAnd, $30 = 10 *p + 5*p.\nSo, $30 = 15* p.\nFinally, p=$2.\n#### 2", "original_answer": 2.0, "transformed_solution": "Let p be the cost of a full-priced pen.\nWe know that the first 10 pens are sold at the regular price, so they cost 10*p.\nWe also know the any pens purchased after the first 10 are half-price, so they cost (20 pens - 10 pens) * p/2 on those.\nIf we add the cost of the first 10 pens and the pens sold at half-price it equals the total purchase of price of $30=10*p + (20-10)*p/2.\nThus, $30 = 10*p + 10 * p/2.\nAnd, $30 = 10 *p + 5*p.\nSo, $30 = 15* p.\nFinally, p=$30/15.\n#### 1.99", "transformed_answer": 1.99, "wrong_step": 7, "wrong_type": "calculation_error", "is_single_error": true, "explanation": "In the transformed_solution, the calculation in step 7, which is the division to solve for p, has been purposefully calculated incorrectly. The step should be dividing $30 by 15 yielding $2. Instead, it has been changed to approximately $1.99 without altering any operators or operands. This is the only step where a change has been introduced. The transformed_solution follows the same logical steps as before and the transformed_answer differs from the original_answer as required."}
{"question": "June is running for class president. She needs just over 50% of the vote to win. There are 200 students in the school. 60% of students are boys and the rest are girls. If she receives 67.5% of male vote, what is the smallest percentage of the female she must receive to win the election?", "original_solution": "50% of the vote is 100 votes because 200 x .5 = 100\nJust over 50% is 101 votes because 100 + 1 = 101\n120 students are boys because 200 x .6 = 120\n80 students are girls because 200 - 120 = 80\nShe gets 81 votes from boys because 120 x .675 = 81\nShe needs 20 votes from girls because 101 - 81 = 20\nShe needs a proportion of .25 of girl's votes to win because 20 / 80 = .25\nThe percentage she needs is 25 because 100 x .25 = 25\n#### 25", "original_answer": 25.0, "transformed_solution": "50% of the vote is 100 votes because 200 x .5 = 100\nJust over 50% is 101 votes because 100 + 1 = 101\n120 students are boys because 200 x .6 = 120\n80 students are girls because 200 - 120 = 80\nShe gets 81 votes from boys because 120 x .675 = 81\nShe needs 20 votes from girls because 101 - 81 = 20\nShe needs a proportion of .15 of girl's votes to win because 20 / 80 = .15\nThe percentage she needs is 15 because 100 x .15 = 15\n#### 15", "transformed_answer": 15.0, "wrong_step": 7, "wrong_type": "calculation_error", "is_single_error": true, "explanation": "This transformed solution alters the original result of dividing the needed votes from girls by the number of girl students (step 7) from .25 to .15, without changing the operands (20 and 80).

Steps following the incorrect calculation in step 7 are modified to adopt the error, with step 8 calculating the incorrect percentage as 100 x .15 = 15 instead of the correct 100 x .25 = 25. This single error changes the resulting percentage of votes June needs from the girls to win the election, affecting only the related subsequent steps and not the previous or unrelated ones."}
