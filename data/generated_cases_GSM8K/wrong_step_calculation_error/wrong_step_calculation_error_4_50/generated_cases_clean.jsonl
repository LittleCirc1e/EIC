{"question": "James does chores around the class. There are 3 bedrooms, 1 living room, and 2 bathrooms to clean. The bedrooms each take 20 minutes to clean. The living room takes as long as the 3 bedrooms combined. The bathroom takes twice as long as the living room. He also cleans the outside which takes twice as long as cleaning the house. He splits the chores with his 2 siblings who are just as fast as him. How long, in hours, does he work?", "original_solution": "It takes 3*20=60 minutes to clean the living room\nSo it is 60/60=1 hour\nThe bathroom takes 1*2=2 hours\nSo all together the inside takes 1+1+2=4 hours\nThe outside takes 4*2=8 hours\nSo the chores take 4+8=12 hours\nHe splits it 1+2=3 ways\nSo he works 12/3=4 hours\n#### 4", "original_answer": 4.0, "transformed_solution": "It takes 3*20=60 minutes to clean the living room\nSo it is 60/60=1 hour\nThe bathroom takes 1*2=2 hours\nSo all together the inside takes 1+1+2=5 hours\nThe outside takes 5*2=10 hours\nSo the chores take 5+10=15 hours\nHe splits it 1+2=3 ways\nSo he works 15/3=5 hours\n#### 5", "transformed_answer": 5.0, "wrong_step": 4, "wrong_type": "calculation_error", "is_single_error": true, "explanation": "In the transformed solution, the calculation error is introduced in step 4, where the total time for the inside chores is incorrectly summed up as 5 hours instead of 4.

{"question": "A shop is offering a discount on pens. If you buy 10 pens at the regular price, you can get the next 10 for half off. A customer came in and bought 20 pens for $30. What's the regular price of one pen in dollars?", "original_solution": "Let p be the cost of a full-priced pen.\nWe know that the first 10 pens are sold at the regular price, so they cost 10*p.\nWe also know the any pens purchased after the first 10 are half-price, so they cost (20 pens - 10 pens) * p/2 on those.\nIf we add the cost of the first 10 pens and the pens sold at half-price it equals the total purchase of price of $30=10*p + (20-10)*p/2.\nThus, $30 = 10*p + 10 * p/2.\nAnd, $30 = 10 *p + 5*p.\nSo, $30 = 15* p.\nFinally, p=$2.\n#### 2", "original_answer": 2.0, "transformed_solution": "Let p be the cost of a full-priced pen.\nWe know that the first 10 pens are sold at the regular price, so they cost 10*p.\nWe also know the any pens purchased after the first 10 are half-price, so they cost (20 pens - 10 pens) * p/2 on those.\nIf we add the cost of the first 10 pens and the pens sold at half-price it equals the total purchase of price of $30=10*p + (20-10)*p/2.\nThus, $30 = 10*p + 10 * p/2.\nAnd, $30 = 10 *p + 5*p.\nSo, $30 = 15* p.\nFinally, p=$1.50.\n#### 1.50", "transformed_answer": 1.5, "wrong_step": 4, "wrong_type": "calculation_error", "is_single_error": true, "explanation": "In the transformed solution, the calculation in step 4 is incorrect.
