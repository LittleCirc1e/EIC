{"question": "a can do a piece of work in 10 days and b alone can do it in 15 days . how much time will both take to finish the work ?", "answer": "In one day, a can do 1/10 of the work because 1/10 = 0.1\nIn one day, b can do 1/15 of the work because 1/15 = 0.06666666666666667\nIn one day, they can do 0.1 + 0.06666666666666667 = 0.16666666666666669 of the work together because 0.1 + 0.06666666666666667 = 0.16666666666666669\nThey will finish the work in 6 days because 1 / 0.16666666666666669 = 6.000000000000001\n#### 6"}
{"question": "two pipes a and b can fill a tank in 20 and 30 minutes respectively . if both the pipes are used together , then how long it will take to fill the tank ?", "answer": "In 1 minute, pipe a can fill 1/20 of the tank because 1/20 = 0.05\nIn 1 minute, pipe b can fill 1/30 of the tank because 1/30 = 0.03333333333333333\nIn 1 minute, both pipes together can fill 1/20 + 1/30 = 1/12 of the tank because 1/20 + 1/30 = 0.08333333333333333\nIt will take 12 minutes to fill the tank because 1 / (1/12) = 12\n#### 12"}
