{"question": "A searchlight on top of the watchtower makes 4 revolutions per minute. What is the probability that a man appearing near the tower will stay in the dark for at least 12 seconds?", "answer": "To find the probability, we need to first calculate the time it takes for 4 revolutions.\nThere are 60 seconds in a minute, so the time for 4 revolutions is 60 seconds / 4 = 15 seconds.\nThis means that the searchlight completes 4 revolutions in 15 seconds. To stay in the dark for at least 12 seconds, the man must arrive during the 3 seconds of light.\nThe probability of the man staying in the dark for at least 12 seconds is 3 seconds / 15 seconds = 1/5.\n#### 1/5"}
{"question": "A car traveling at a certain constant speed takes 2 seconds longer to travel 1 kilometer than it would take to travel 1 kilometer at 225 kilometers per hour. At what speed, in kilometers per hour, is the car traveling?", "answer": "Let x be the speed of the car in kilometers per hour.\nTime to travel 1 kilometer at the speed x is 1/x hours.\nTime to travel 1 kilometer at 225 kilometers per hour is 1/225 hours.\nThe difference in time is 1/x - 1/225 = 2/3600 hours.\nMultiplying by 225x on both sides, we get 225 - x = 2/3600 * 225x.\n225 - x = (225/1800) * x\n225 - (225/1800) * x = x\n225 = (225/1800) * x + x\n225 = (2025/1800) * x\n225 = (45/40) * x\n225 = (9/8) * x\nx = 225 * 8/9\nx = 200\n#### 200"}
{"question": "a train covers a distance of 12 km in 10 minutes . if it takes 6 seconds to pass a telegraph post , then the length of the train is", "answer": "First, convert the time from minutes to seconds: 10 minutes * 60 seconds per minute = 600 seconds.\nNext, use the formula speed = distance/time to find the speed of the train: speed = 12 km / 600 seconds = 0.02 km/s.\nThen, convert the speed from km/s to m/s: 0.02 km/s * 1000 m per km = 20 m/s.\nNow, use the speed of the train to find the length of the train when it takes 6 seconds to pass a telegraph post: length = speed * time = 20 m/s * 6 s = 120 meters.\n#### 120"}
