{"question": "What is the perimeter, in meters, of a rectangular garden 12 meters wide that has the same area as a rectangular playground 16 meters long and 12 meters wide?", "answer": "The area of the rectangular playground is 16 x 12 = 192 square meters.\nThe area of the rectangular garden is also 192 square meters because it has the same area.\nThe length of the garden is 192 / 12 = 16 meters.\nThe perimeter of the garden is 2(16+12) = 2(28) = 56 meters.\n#### 56"}
{"question": "If each participant of a chess tournament plays exactly one game with each of the remaining participants, then 231 games will be played during the tournament. What is the number of participants?", "answer": "Let n be the number of participants.\nThe total number of games played is given by the formula nC2 = (n*(n-1))/2 = 231.\nn*(n-1) = 462.\nn^2 - n - 462 = 0.\nUsing the quadratic formula, n = (1 + sqrt(1+1848))/2 or n = (1 - sqrt(1+1848))/2.\nAs n must be a positive integer, n = (1 + sqrt(1849))/2 = (1 + 43)/2 = 44/2 = 22.\n#### 22"}
{"question": "A bag holds 3 red marbles and 3 green marbles. If you removed two randomly selected marbles from the bag, without replacement, what is the probability that both would be red?", "answer": "The total number of marbles is 6 because 3 + 3 = 6.\nThe probability of selecting a red marble first is 3/6.\nThe probability of selecting a red marble second is 2/5 because there is one less marble in the bag.\nThe combined probability is 3/6 * 2/5 = 6/30 = 1/5.\n#### 1/5"}
