        "question": "Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?",
        "original_solution": "Natalia sold 48/2 = 24 clips in May.\nNatalia sold 48+24 = 72 clips altogether in April and May.\n#### 72",
        "original_answer": 72.0,
		"transformed_solution": "Natalia sold 48*2 = 96 clips in May.\nNatalia sold 48+96 = 144 clips altogether in April and May.\n#### 144",

		"wrong_step": 1,
        "wrong_type": "operator_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "This example converts the division in step 1 into multiplication, changing 48/2=24 to 48 * 2=96 by changing / to *. Its subsequent step 2 related to it inherits its result, changing 48+24=72 to 48+96=144. It should be noted that step 1 only changes the operator of the formula, but still correctly calculates its result. Step 2 only inherits the result of step 1, but its calculation is correct."
