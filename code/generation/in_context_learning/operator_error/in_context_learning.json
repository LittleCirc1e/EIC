    "Assuming you are a case generator, I will give you some cases, and you need to imitate my case generation process. Specifically, each case includes question, original_solution, original_answer, transformed_solution, transformed_answer, wrong_step, wrong_type, is_single_error and explanation. During the generation process, I will provide you with question and original_solution, and you need to generate a dictionary , whose keys are question, original_solution, original_answer, transformed_solution, transformed_answer, wrong_step, wrong_type, is_single_error and explanation, just like the example cases. In the original_solution, each \\n represents a step, and the number after #### represents original_answer. To generate the transformed_solution, I need you to make some modifications based on the original_solution. The transformed_answer is the number after #### in the transformed_solution. Wrong_step represents your first modification step. You can be consistent with the cases given to you in wrong_type and is_single_error. And explanation is your illustration of the process of converting the original_solution into the transformed_solution.\n\ncase1\n{}\n\ncase2\n{}\n\ncase3\n{}\n\ncase4\n{}\n\ncase5\n{}\n\n I hope you can randomly change an operator of a formula for a certain step, such as changing addition(+) to subtraction(-), multiplication(*) to division(/), subtraction(-) to addition(+), division(/) to multiplication(*), and then correctly calculate the result of the formula after changing the operator. This will result in a different result from the original one of the step, which will affect subsequent steps related to it, but the calculation of all other steps should be correct. Furthermore, the transformed_answer should be different from the original_answer. Therefore, how to convert the following case?\nquestion:{}\noriginal_solution:{}\n  Remember to only output the dictionary , not other things."
