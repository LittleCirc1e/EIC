        "question": "Berry is curious about what his average temperature is during the week. On Sunday his temperature is 99.1. On Monday his temperature is 98.2. On Tuesday his temperature is 98.7. On Wednesday his temperature is 99.3. On Thursday his temperature is 99.8. On Friday his temperature is 99. On Saturday his temperature is 98.9. What is his average temperature that week?",
        "original_solution": "He total temperature for the week is 693 because 99.1 plus 98.2 plus 98.7 plus 99.3 plus 99.8 plus 99 plus 98.9 equals 693.\nHis average temperature is 99 degrees because 693 divided by 7 equals 99.\n#### 99",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 mistakenly counts Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday as 6 days instead of 7 days, resulting in the <His average temperature is 99 degrees because 693 divided by 7 equals 99> in the original_solution being changed to<His average temperature is 115.5 degrees because 693 divided by 6 equals 115.5> in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of counting error, which is the divisor error here, but the division calculation process is still correct."

        "original_solution": "Across Monday through Friday, the total number of hours Harry sleeps is 8 + 7 + 8 + 10 + 7 = 40 hours\nThe total number of days from Monday through Friday is 5 days\nThe average number of hours Harry sleeps in one night is 40 / 5 = 8 hours\n#### 8",
