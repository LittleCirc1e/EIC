        "question": "The class plans to take a field trip to the zoo. The cost to rent a school bus is $100. The cost of admission is $10 per student. The teacher is allowed in for free. If the class has a budget of $350, how many students can go on the field trip?",
        "original_solution": "There is $350 - $100 = $250 available to pay for the students' admission fees.\nThis means they can afford to bring $250 / $10 = 25 students on the trip.\n#### 25",
        "original_answer": 25.0,
		"transformed_solution": "There is $350 - $100 - $50= $200 available to pay for the students' admission fees because there is an additional cost of $50 for buying drinks.\nThis means they can afford to bring $200 / $10 = 20 students on the trip.\n#### 20",

        "explanation": "Step 1 adds information that is not mentioned in the question statement <because there is an additional cost of $50 for buying drinks>, resulting in step 1 changing from $350- $100=$250 in the original_solution to $350- $100- $50=$200 in the transformed_solution. Its subsequent related step 2 is affected, changing from $250/$10=25 to $200/$10=20. It should be noted that you only need to consider one error of adding additional information in one step, and the other calculation processes should be correct."
