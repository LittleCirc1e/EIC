    "Assuming you are a case generator, I will give you some cases, and you need to imitate my case generation process. Specifically, each case includes question, original_solution, original_answer, transformed_solution, transformed_answer, wrong_step, wrong_type, is_single_error and explanation. During the generation process, I will provide you with question and original_solution, and you need to generate a dictionary , whose keys are question, original_solution, original_answer, transformed_solution, transformed_answer, wrong_step, wrong_type, is_single_error and explanation, just like the example cases. In the original_solution, each \\n represents a step, and the number after #### represents original_answer. To generate the transformed_solution, I need you to make some modifications based on the original_solution. The transformed_answer is the number after #### in the transformed_solution. Wrong_step represents your first modification step. You can be consistent with the cases given to you in wrong_type and is_single_error. And explanation is your illustration of the process of converting the original_solution into the transformed_solution. \n\ncase1\n{}\n\ncase2\n{}\n\ncase3\n{}\n\ncase4\n{}\n\ncase5\n{}\n\n I hope that in the example you create, the transformed_solution has one less step compared to the original_solution. It can be divided into three situations: deleting the first step, intermediate steps and the last step. For the first step, you need to delete step 1, and step 1 often references the number in the question, so you need to change the subsequent steps that reference the result of step 1 to directly reference the number in the question. If multiple numbers are referenced by step 1, choose the largest one for the subsequent related steps to reference. For intermediate steps, you need to randomly delete a certain intermediate step. On one hand, if the intermediate step references the result of the previous step that is related to it, its subsequent related steps reference its result. After deleting this step, you need to change its subsequent related steps that originally referred to the result of this step to refer to the result of its previous step. On the other hand, if this intermediate step does not reference the result of the previous step that is related to it, and its subsequent related steps reference its result. After deleting this step, you need to change its subsequent related steps that originally referred to the result of this step to refer to the number in the question this step references. If multiple numbers are referenced by this deleted step, choose the largest one for the subsequent related steps to reference. For the last step, it can be simply deleted, and the result of the second-to-last step becomes the final outcome. Note that wrong_step is the first step that references the result of the deleted step. Furthermore, the transformed_answer should be different from the original_answer. Therefore, how to convert the following case?\nquestion:{}\noriginal_solution:{}\n  Remember to only output the dictionary , not other things."
