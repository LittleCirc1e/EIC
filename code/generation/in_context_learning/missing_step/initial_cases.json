        "explanation": "Here, step 1 has been removed. In the original_solution, step 1 references the number 48 from the question, and step 2 references the result of step 1. So after deleting step 1, step 2 should change the result 24 of the referenced step 1 to the number 48 in the question, causing the formula to change from 48+24=72 to 48+48=96. It should be noted that the calculation of step 2 after the transformation is still correct. It is step 1 in the transformed_solution, which is also step 2 in the original_solution, that serves as the first step referencing incorrect number in the transformed_solution, so the wrong_step is 1."
