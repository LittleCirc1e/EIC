        "original_solution": "A total of 20 x 100 = 2000 grams are sold every week.\nSince 1 kilogram is equal to 1000 grams, then 2000/1000 = 2 kilograms of sugar are sold every week.\n#### 2",

		"transformed_solution": "A total of 20 x 100 = 2000 grams are sold every week.\nSince 1 kilogram is equal to 2000 grams, then 2000/2000 = 1 kilograms of sugar are sold every week.\n#### 1",

        "explanation": "Here, step 2 makes incorrect unit conversion, which means 1 kilogram is wrongly equal to 2000 grams instead of 1000 grams, resulting in 2000/1000 = 2  in the original_solution becoming 2000/2000 = 1 in the transformed_solution. It should be noted that you only need to consider one step of unit conversion error, and the other calculation processes are still correct."

        "question": "A chocolate bar weighs 125 g. A shopkeeper has just received a 2 kilogram box of chocolate. How many bars does this represent?",
        "original_solution": "We have 2 kg = 2 * 1000 = 2000 g\nSo, the number of bars of chocolate is 2000 / 125 = 16\n#### 16",

        "question": "Sam works at the Widget Factory, assembling Widgets. He can assemble 1 widget every 10 minutes. Jack from the loading dock can help assemble widgets when he doesn't have anything else to do. When he helps, they put together 2 complete widgets every 15 minutes. Recently the factory hired Tony to help assemble widgets. Being new to the job, he doesn't work as fast as Sam or Jack. Yesterday Sam worked for 6 hours before he had to leave work early for a dentist appointment. Jack was able to help out for 4 hours before he had to go back to the loading dock to unload a new shipment of widget materials. Tony worked the entire 8-hour shift. At the end of the day, they had completed 68 widgets. How long does it take Tony to assemble a Widget, in minutes?",
        "original_solution": "Sam completes a widget every 10 minutes.\nWhen Jack helps they finish 2 in 15 minutes. Sam has finished 1 widget and has begun working on another one, and Jack finishes the second one at 15 minutes. So it takes Jack 15 minutes to complete a widget.\nSam worked for 6 hours yesterday, so he was able to complete 6 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 10 minutes per widget = 36 widgets.\nJack worked for 4 hours, so he was able to complete 4 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 15 minutes per widget = 16 widgets.\nSam, Jack, and Tony were able to complete 68 widgets together. So of those, Tony personally completed 68 widgets - 36 widgets - 16 widgets = 16 widgets.\nIt took Tony 8 hours to complete those 16 widgets, so he takes 8 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 16 widgets = 30 minutes per widget.\n#### 30",
