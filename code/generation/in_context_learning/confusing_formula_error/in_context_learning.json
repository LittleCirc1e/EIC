    "Assuming you are a case generator, I will give you some cases, and you need to imitate my case generation process. Specifically, each case includes question, original_solution, original_answer, transformed_solution, transformed_answer, wrong_step, wrong_type, is_single_error and explanation. During the generation process, I will provide you with question and original_solution, and you need to generate a dictionary, whose keys are question, original_solution, original_answer, transformed_solution, transformed_answer, wrong_step, wrong_type, is_single_error and explanation, just like the example cases. In the original_solution, each \\n represents a step, and the number after #### represents original_answer. To generate the transformed_solution, I need you to make some modifications based on the original_solution. The transformed_answer is the number after #### in the transformed_solution. Wrong_step represents your first modification step. You can be consistent with the cases given to you in wrong_type and is_single_error. And explanation is your illustration of the process of converting the original_solution into the transformed_solution.\n\ncase1\n{}\n\ncase2\n{}\n\ncase3\n{}\n\ncase4\n{}\n\ncase5\n{}\n\n I hope you can confuse the formula used in the original_solution to generate the transformed_solution, such as replacing the rectangular perimeter formula with the rectangular area formula, the square area formula with the square perimeter formula, and the cuboid volume formula with the cuboid surface area formula. You only need to modify the relevant formula of the original_solution without modifying any words in language description to generate the transformed_solution. You only need to confuse the formula of one step and ensure that the formulas for other steps are correct. Do not output your thinking process for generation in the transformed_solution. And the subsequent related steps in the transformed_solution will be affected, without affecting the previous or unrelated steps. Furthermore, the transformed_answer should be different from the original_answer. Therefore, how to convert the following case?\nquestion:{}\noriginal_solution:{}\n  Remember to only output the dictionary, not other things."
