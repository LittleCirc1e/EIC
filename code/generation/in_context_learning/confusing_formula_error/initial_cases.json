        "question": "Joy has 250 feet of tape. She wants to wrap the tape around a field that is 20 feet wide and 60 feet long. How much tape will Joy have left over after wrapping tape around the field once?",
        "original_solution": "The perimeter of the field is 20+20+60+60=160 feet.\nJoy will have 250-160=90 feet of tape left over.\n#### 90",
        "original_answer": 90.0,
		"transformed_solution": "The perimeter of the field is 20*60=1200 feet.\nJoy will have 250-1200=-950 feet of tape left over.\n#### -950",

        "wrong_type": "confusing_formula_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, step 1 confuses the perimeter and area of rectangle. The question requires that the perimeter of the rectangle to be solved be equal to the length plus length plus width plus width, rather than the length multiplied by width, which is equivalent to the area of the rectangle, resulting in 20+20+60+60=160 in the original_solution being changed to 20*60=1200 in the transformed_solution. This affects the subsequent step 2, changing from 250-160=90 to 250-1200=-950. Note that the language description of step 1 < The perimeter of the field is > in the original_solution remains unchanged in the transformed_solution. It should be also noted that you need to only consider one step of confusing formula error, and the other calculation processes are still correct. In this example, only step 1 mistakenly uses the formula of rectangular perimeter, while the other calculation processes are still correct."
