        "question": "Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?",
        "original_solution": "Natalia sold 48/2 = 24 clips in May.\nNatalia sold 48+24 = 72 clips altogether in April and May.\n#### 72",
        "original_answer": 72.0,
		"transformed_solution": "Natalia sold 48/2 = 12 clips in May.\nNatalia sold 48+12 =60  clips altogether in April and May. \n#### 60",

        "wrong_type": "calculation_error",
        "is_single_error": true,
        "explanation": "Here, the 48/2 in step 1 is wrongly calculated as 12. It should be noted that step 2 needs to use the result of step 1, so the original 48+24 will be changed to 48+12. So, it should be noted that if a step is miscalculated, subsequent steps will inherit its error and use the number of miscalculations to further calculate. Futhermore, step 2 needs to be calculated correctly, and you should only consider one step error."

It is important to note that you should only consider one step error. Therefore, the subsequent steps are equivalent to inheriting the erroneous result of the first step, except that an error occurs during the expression, but the calculation result of the expression should still be correct.

Step 3 inherits the error from step 2, not only modifying the formula $66- $6=$60 to $66- $12=$56, but also modifying the language description related to step 2 from <I spend $6 on oranges> to <I spend $12 on oranges>. Step 5 inherits the error from step 3, modifying $60=12W+12A to $56=12W+12A. Step 6 inherits the error from step 5, modifying $60=12 (4A)+12A to $56=12 (4A)+12A.
