        "original_solution": "Natalia sold 48/2 = 24 clips in May.\nNatalia sold 48+24 = 72 clips altogether in April and May.\n#### 72",

        "explanation": "Step 2 mistakenly references 24 as 20 from step 1 and changes 48+24=72 to 48+20=68. It should be noted that step 1 in the transformed_solution <Natalia sold 48/2 = 24 clips in May.> should be the same as the step 1 in the original_solution <Natalia sold 48/2 = 24 clips in May.> and calculates its result 24 correctly. You need to only consider one error of referencing, so the calculation of all steps is still correct."
