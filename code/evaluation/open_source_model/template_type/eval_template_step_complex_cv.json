    "Below is an instruction that describes a task.\n\nWrite a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAccording to the [Question] and [Solution], please determine if the [Solution] is correct. If you think the [Solution] is incorrect, you only need to consider that a single type of error occurs in one step, that is, there is only a certain type of error occurring in a certain step, and it will affect the subsequent steps that reference its results and lead to the final wrong result. In other words, this certain step is the first step to make a mistake and also the root cause of the mistake. You only need to determine which is the first step to make a mistake.\nIt should be noted that the certain error type that appears in the [Solution] is referencing context value error, which represents only an error in the operand of the formula in the first wrong step when referencing the number in the [Question].\n In the [Solution], each \\n represents a step, and the number after #### represents the final answer. \nIf the [Solution] is correct, format your response as: The solution is correct, and the explanation is #, which is your explanation about why the [Solution] is correct. If the [Solution] is incorrect, format your response as: The solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step #, which must be an integer, and the explanation is #, which is your explanation about why the [Solution] is incorrect.\nNext, I will provide you with an example to help you understand the definition of first wrong step.\nHere is a [Question] and its correct [Solution].\n[Question] is 'On the weekend, Tony will walk to the store. On weekdays, he runs to the store. When he walks, he goes 2 MPH. When he runs, he goes 10 MPH. The store is 4 miles away. If he goes on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, what is the average time in minutes that he spends to get to the store?'\nThe correct [Solution] is 'On Sunday he takes 2 hours to get there because 4 / 2 = 2\nThis takes him 120 minutes because 2 x 60 = 120\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him .4 hours to get to the store because 4 / 10 = .4\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him 24 minutes to get to the store because .4 x 60 = 24\nIn total it takes him 168 minutes to get to the store because 120 + 24 + 24 = 168\nOn average it takes him 56 minutes because 168 / 3 = 56\n#### 56'\nThe following is two incorrect [Solution]s and their corresponding [Output]s.\nThe first incorrect [Solution] is 'On Sunday he takes 4 hours to get there because 4 / 1 = 4\nThis takes him 240 minutes because 4 x 60 = 240\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him .4 hours to get to the store because 4 / 10 = .4\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him 24 minutes to get to the store because .4 x 60 = 24\nIn total it takes him 288 minutes to get to the store because 240 + 24 + 24 = 288\nOn average it takes him 96 minutes because 288 / 3 = 96\n#### 96'.And your [Output] should be 'The solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 1, and the explanation is that step 1 first makes an error in referencing the number of the question description <When he walks, he goes 2 MPH.>. It erroneously references 2 as 1, causing the formula to calculate 4/1=4 instead of 4/2=2. This affects subsequent steps 2, 5, and 6 that reference its result. Step 2 incorrectly calculates 4 x 60=240 instead of 2 x 60=120. Step 5 incorrectly calculates 240+24+24=288 instead of 120+24+24=168. And step 6 incorrectly calculates 288/3=96 instead of 168/3=56. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 1.'.\nThe second incorrect [Solution] is 'On Sunday he takes 2 hours to get there because 4 / 2 = 2\nThis takes him 120 minutes because 2 x 60 = 120\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him .2 hours to get to the store because 4 / 20 = .2\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him 12 minutes to get to the store because .2 x 60 = 12\nIn total it takes him 144 minutes to get to the store because 120 + 12 + 12 = 144\nOn average it takes him 48 minutes because 144 / 3 = 48\n#### 48'. And your [Output] should be 'The solution is incorrect, the first wrong step is step 3, and the explanation is that step 3 first makes an error in referencing the number of the question description <When he runs, he goes 10 MPH.>. It erroneously references 10 as 20, causing the formula to calculate 4 / 20 = .2 instead of 4 / 10 = .4. This affects subsequent steps 4, 5, and 6 that reference its result. Step 4 incorrectly calculates .2 x 60 = 12 instead of .4 x 60 = 24. Step 5 incorrectly calculates 120 + 12 + 12 = 144 instead of 120 + 24 + 24 = 168. And step 6 incorrectly calculates 144 / 3 = 48 instead of 168/3=56.The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 3.'. \nPlease provide an appropriate response for the following case.\n\n[Question]{question}\n\n[Solution]{solution}.\n\n### Response:"
