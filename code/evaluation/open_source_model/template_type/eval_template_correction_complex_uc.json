    "Below is an instruction that describes a task.\n\nWrite a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAccording to the [Question] and [Solution], please determine if the [Solution] is correct. In the [Solution], each \\n represents a step, and the number after #### represents the final answer.\n If you think the [Solution] is incorrect, you only need to consider that a single type of error occurs in one step, that is, there is only a certain type of error occurring in a certain step, and it will affect the subsequent steps that reference its results and lead to the final wrong result. In other words, this certain step is the first step to make a mistake and also the root cause of the mistake.\nIt should be noted that the certain error type that appears in the [Solution] is unit conversion error, which represents the incorrect use of unit conversion. For example, there are 12 inches in a foot, 1000 grams in a kilogram, 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, which may cause an error in the operand of the formula in the first wrong step.\n If the [Solution] is correct, format your response as: The solution is correct, and the explanation is #, which is your explanation about why the [Solution] is correct. If the [Solution] is incorrect, format your response as: The solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #, which is your answer after correction, and the explanation is #, which is your explanation about how to get the correct answer.\nNext, I will provide you with an example to help you understand how to correct.\nHere is a [Question] and its correct [Solution].\n[Question] is 'On the weekend, Tony will walk to the store. On weekdays, he runs to the store. When he walks, he goes 2 MPH. When he runs, he goes 10 MPH. The store is 4 miles away. If he goes on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, what is the average time in minutes that he spends to get to the store?'\nThe correct [Solution] is 'On Sunday he takes 2 hours to get there because 4 / 2 = 2\nThis takes him 120 minutes because 2 x 60 = 120\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him .4 hours to get to the store because 4 / 10 = .4\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him 24 minutes to get to the store because .4 x 60 = 24\nIn total it takes him 168 minutes to get to the store because 120 + 24 + 24 = 168\nOn average it takes him 56 minutes because 168 / 3 = 56\n#### 56'\nThe following is two incorrect [Solution]s and their corresponding [Output]s.\nThe first incorrect [Solution] is 'On Sunday he takes 2 hours to get there because 4 / 2 = 2\nThis takes him 100 minutes because 2 x 50 = 100\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him .4 hours to get to the store because 4 / 10 = .4\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him 24 minutes to get to the store because .4 x 60 = 24\nIn total it takes him 148 minutes to get to the store because 100 + 24 + 24 = 148\nOn average it takes him 49.3 minutes because 148 / 3 = 49.3\n#### 49.3'.And your [Output] should be 'The solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 56, and the explanation is that step 2 makes an incorrect unit conversion, mistakenly assuming that 1 hour has 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes, and it wrongly calculates 2 x 50=100 instead of 2 x 60=120. This affects steps 5 and 6. Step 5 erroneously calculates 100+24+24=148 instead of 120+24+24=168. Step 6 erroneously calculates 148/3=49.3 instead of 168/3=56.'.\nThe second incorrect [Solution] is 'On Sunday he takes 2 hours to get there because 4 / 2 = 2\nThis takes him 120 minutes because 2 x 60 = 120\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him .4 hours to get to the store because 4 / 10 = .4\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him 16 minutes to get to the store because .4 x 40 = 16\nIn total it takes him 152 minutes to get to the store because 120 + 16 + 16 = 152\nOn average it takes him 50.66 minutes because 152 / 3 = 50.66\n#### 50.66'. And your [Output] should be 'The solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 56, and the explanation is that step 4 makes an incorrect unit conversion, mistakenly assuming that 1 hour has 40 minutes instead of 60 minutes, and wrongly calculates. 4 x 40=16 instead of. 4 x 60=24. This affects steps 5 and 6. Step 5 erroneously calculates 120+16+16=152 instead of 120+24+24=168. Step 6 erroneously calculates 152/3=50.66 instead of 168/3=56.'.\nPlease provide an appropriate response for the following case.\n\n[Question]{question}\n\n[Solution]{solution}.\n\n### Response:"
