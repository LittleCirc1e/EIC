    "Below is an instruction that describes a task.\n\nWrite a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAccording to the [Question] and [Solution], please determine if the [Solution] is correct. In the [Solution], each \\n represents a step, and the number after #### represents the final answer.\n If you think the [Solution] is incorrect, you only need to consider that a single type of error occurs in one step, that is, there is only a certain type of error occurring in a certain step, and it will affect the subsequent steps that reference its results and lead to the final wrong result. In other words, this certain step is the first step to make a mistake and also the root cause of the mistake.\nIt should be noted that the certain error type that appears in the [Solution] is confusing formula error, which represents the incorrect use of formula, such as confusing the rectangular perimeter formula with the rectangular area formula, the square area formula with the square perimeter formula, and the cuboid volume formula with the cuboid surface area formula. This error type may cause errors in the operands and operators of the formula in the first wrong step.\n If the [Solution] is correct, format your response as: The solution is correct, and the explanation is #, which is your explanation about why the [Solution] is correct. If the [Solution] is incorrect, format your response as: The solution is incorrect, the correct answer is #, which is your answer after correction, and the explanation is #, which is your explanation about how to get the correct answer.\nNext, I will provide you with an example to help you understand how to correct.\nHere is a [Question] and its correct [Solution].\n[Question] is 'Linda is painting her bedroom. Her bedroom has 4 walls, with the room being 20 feet wide by 20 feet long by 8 feet tall. One wall has a 3-foot by 7-foot doorway. A second wall has a 6-foot by 4-foot window. A third wall has a 5-foot by 7-foot doorway to a walk-in-closet. And the fourth wall is completely solid. What is the total area of wall space that Linda will have to paint?'\nThe correct [Solution] is 'The solid wall is 8 ft. * 20 ft. = 160 sq. ft.\nThe doorway is 3 ft. * 7 ft. = 21 sq. ft.\nThe window is 6 ft. * 4 ft. = 24 sq. ft.\nThe closet door is 5 ft. * 7 ft. = 35 sq. ft.\nThe total area of the doors and windows is 21 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 80 sq. ft.\nThe solid wall is 160 sq. ft., so before the areas of the doors and window are taken into account, the total wall area is 4 * 160 sq. ft. = 640 sq. ft.\nTaking into account the doors and window, the total wall area Linda will have to paint is 640 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 560 sq. ft.\n#### 560'\nThe following is two incorrect [Solution]s and their corresponding [Output]s.\nThe first incorrect [Solution] is 'The solid wall is 8 ft. * 20 ft. = 160 sq. ft.\nThe doorway is 3 ft. + 7 ft. + 3 ft. + 7 ft.= 20 sq. ft.\nThe window is 6 ft. * 4 ft. = 24 sq. ft.\nThe closet door is 5 ft. * 7 ft. = 35 sq. ft.\nThe total area of the doors and windows is 20 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 79 sq. ft.\nThe solid wall is 160 sq. ft., so before the areas of the doors and window are taken into account, the total wall area is 4 * 160 sq. ft. = 640 sq. ft.\nTaking into account the doors and window, the total wall area Linda will have to paint is 640 sq. ft. - 79 sq. ft. = 561 sq. ft.\n#### 561'.And your [Output] should be 'The solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 560, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 confuses the perimeter and area formulas of rectangle and it should calculate the area of the rectangle which is equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the length plus length plus width plus width, equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle. That means, it should calculate 3 ft. * 7 ft. = 21 sq. ft. instead of 3 ft. + 7 ft. + 3 ft. + 7 ft.= 20 sq. ft. Step 5 and 7, as the subsequent steps of step 2, reference the wrong result of step 2, resulting in the incorrect final answer. Step 5 miscalculates 20 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 79 sq. ft. instead of 21 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 80 sq. ft. And step 7 miscalculates 640 sq. ft. - 79 sq. ft. = 561 sq. ft. instead of 640 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 560 sq. ft.'.\nThe second incorrect [Solution] is 'The solid wall is 8 ft. * 20 ft. = 160 sq. ft.\nThe doorway is 3 ft. * 7 ft. = 21 sq. ft.\nThe window is 6 ft. + 4 ft. + 6 ft. + 4 ft. = 20 sq. ft.\nThe closet door is 5 ft. * 7 ft. = 35 sq. ft.\nThe total area of the doors and windows is 21 sq. ft + 20 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 76 sq. ft.\nThe solid wall is 160 sq. ft., so before the areas of the doors and window are taken into account, the total wall area is 4 * 160 sq. ft. = 640 sq. ft.\nTaking into account the doors and window, the total wall area Linda will have to paint is 640 sq. ft. - 76 sq. ft. = 564 sq. ft.\n#### 564'. And your [Output] should be 'The solution is incorrect, the correct answer is 560, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 3. Step 3 confuses the perimeter and area formulas of rectangle and it should calculate the area of the rectangle which is equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the length plus length plus width plus width, equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle. That means, it should calculate 6 ft. * 4 ft. = 24 sq. ft. instead of 6 ft. + 4 ft. + 6 ft. + 4 ft. = 20 sq. ft. Step 5 and 7, as the subsequent steps of step 2, reference the wrong result of step 2, resulting in the incorrect final answer. Step 5 miscalculates 21 sq. ft + 20 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 76 sq. ft. instead of 21 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 80 sq. ft. And step 7 miscalculates 640 sq. ft. - 76 sq. ft. = 564 sq. ft. instead of 640 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 560 sq. ft.'.\nPlease provide an appropriate response for the following case.\n\n[Question]{question}\n\n[Solution]{solution}.\n\n### Response:"
