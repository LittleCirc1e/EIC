    "Below is an instruction that describes a task.\n\nWrite a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAccording to the [Question] and [Solution], please determine if the [Solution] is correct. In the [Solution], each \\n represents a step, and the number after #### represents the final answer. You need to first determine which is the first step to make a mistake, and then determine which of wrong types it belongs to. The wrong types that can be selected are 'adding_irrelevant_information', 'confusing_formula_error', 'missing_step', 'operator_error', 'unit_conversion_error', 'referencing_previous_step_value_error', 'referencing_context_value_error', 'counting_error', and 'calculation_error'. \n'adding_irrelevant_information' represents that the first wrong step adds some information that is not included in the [Question] statement, which affects the final result.\n'confusing_formula_error' represents the incorrect use of formula, such as confusing the rectangular perimeter formula with the rectangular area formula, the square area formula with the square perimeter formula, and the cuboid volume formula with the cuboid surface area formula, which may cause errors in the operands and operators of the formula in the first wrong step.\n'missing_step' represents the absence of a necessary reasoning step, and if this absent step is added, the entire reasoning will become correct.\n'operator_error' represents only an error in the operator of the formula in the first wrong step.\n'unit_conversion_error' represents the incorrect use of unit conversion, for example, there are 12 inches in a foot, 1000 grams in a kilogram, 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, which may cause an error in the operand of the formula in the first wrong step.\n'referencing_previous_step_value_error' represents only an error in the operand of the formula in the first wrong step when referencing the result of its previous step. \n'referencing_context_value_error' represents only an error in the operand of the formula in the first wrong step when referencing the number in the [Question].\n'counting_error' represents only an error in the counting process, such as counting Saturday and Sunday as 3 days instead of 2 days, which may cause an error in the operand of the formula in the first wrong step.\n'calculation_error' represents that the operands and operators of the formula in the first wrong step are exactly correct, and only the result is calculated incorrectly.\nIf the [Solution] is correct, format your response as: The solution is correct, and the explanation is #, which is your explanation about why the [Solution] is correct. If the [Solution] is incorrect, format your response as: The solution is incorrect, the wrong type is #, which must be chosen from above nine wrong types, and the explanation is #, which is your explanation about why the [Solution] is incorrect.\n\nNext, I will provide examples for each error type to help you understand their definitions.\nHere is a [Question] and its correct [Solution]. \n[Question] is 'Linda is painting her bedroom. Her bedroom has 4 walls, with the room being 20 feet wide by 20 feet long by 8 feet tall. One wall has a 3-foot by 7-foot doorway. A second wall has a 6-foot by 4-foot window. A third wall has a 5-foot by 7-foot doorway to a walk-in-closet. And the fourth wall is completely solid. What is the total area of wall space that Linda will have to paint?' \nThe correct [Solution] is 'The solid wall is 8 ft. * 20 ft. = 160 sq. ft.\nThe doorway is 3 ft. * 7 ft. = 21 sq. ft.\nThe window is 6 ft. * 4 ft. = 24 sq. ft.\nThe closet door is 5 ft. * 7 ft. = 35 sq. ft.\nThe total area of the doors and windows is 21 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 80 sq. ft.\nThe solid wall is 160 sq. ft., so before the areas of the doors and window are taken into account, the total wall area is 4 * 160 sq. ft. = 640 sq. ft.\nTaking into account the doors and window, the total wall area Linda will have to paint is 640 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 560 sq. ft.\n#### 560' \nThe following are examples of [Solution] and [Output] for the following two wrong types corresponding to this [Question]. \nFor 'adding_irrelevant_information', the corresponding wrong [Solution] is ''The first four steps are the same as the correct [Solution].\nTaking into account the doors and window, the total wall area Linda will have to paint is 640 sq. ft. - 100 sq. ft. = 540 sq. ft.\n#### 540', and your [Output] should be 'The solution is incorrect, the wrong type is adding_irrelevant_information, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 5. Step 5 adds information not included in the question statement <Because there is also a door of 20 square feet on the second wall>, causing the result of step 5 to be overestimated by 20, so it belongs to adding_irrelevant_information.'\nFor 'confusing_formula_error', the corresponding wrong [Solution] is ''The first step is the same as the correct [Solution].\nThe doorway is 3 ft. + 7 ft. + 3 ft. + 7 ft.= 20 sq. ft.\nThe window is 6 ft. * 4 ft. = 24 sq. ft.\nThe closet door is 5 ft. * 7 ft. = 35 sq. ft.\nThe total area of the doors and windows is 20 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 79 sq. ft.\nThe solid wall is 160 sq. ft., so before the areas of the doors and window are taken into account, the total wall area is 4 * 160 sq. ft. = 640 sq. ft.\nTaking into account the doors and window, the total wall area Linda will have to paint is 640 sq. ft. - 79 sq. ft. = 561 sq. ft.\n#### 561', and your [Output] should be 'The solution is incorrect, the wrong type is confusing_formula_error, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 confuses the perimeter and area formulas of rectangle and it should calculate the area of the rectangle which is equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the length plus length plus width plus width, equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle. So it belongs to confusing_formula_error.'\n\nHere is another [Question], which is 'On the weekend, Tony will walk to the store. On weekdays, he runs to the store. When he walks, he goes 2 MPH. When he runs, he goes 10 MPH. The store is 4 miles away. If he goes on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, what is the average time in minutes that he spends to get to the store?'.\nThe correct [Solution] is 'On Sunday he takes 2 hours to get there because 4 / 2 = 2\nThis takes him 120 minutes because 2 x 60 = 120\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him .4 hours to get to the store because 4 / 10 = .4\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him 24 minutes to get to the store because .4 x 60 = 24\nIn total it takes him 168 minutes to get to the store because 120 + 24 + 24 = 168\nOn average it takes him 56 minutes because 168 / 3 = 56\n#### 56'\nThe following are examples of [Solution] and [Output] for the following seven other wrong types related to this [Question]. \nFor 'missing_step', the corresponding wrong [Solution] is ''The first three steps are the same as the correct [Solution].\nIn total it takes him 50 minutes to get to the store because 2 + 24 + 24 = 50\nOn average it takes him 16.6 minutes because 50 / 3 = 16.6\n#### 16.6', and your [Output] should be 'The solution is incorrect, the wrong type is missing_step, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 4. Step 4 does not convert the time he went to the store on Sunday from hours to minutes, but directly adds up the time on Sunday (hours) and the time on Tuesday and Thursday (minutes). So there is a missing step here to convert Sunday's time from hours to minutes, and this error belongs to missing_step.'\nFor 'operator_error', the corresponding wrong [Solution] is ''The first five steps are the same as the correct [Solution].\nOn average it takes him 171 minutes because 168 + 3 = 171\n#### 171', and your [Output] should be 'The solution is incorrect, the wrong type is operator_error, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 6. Step 6 mistakenly uses addition instead of division, and only one operator in the formula is incorrect, so it belongs to operator_error.' \nFor 'unit_conversion_error', the corresponding wrong [Solution] is ''The first step is the same as the correct [Solution].\nThis takes him 100 minutes because 2 x 50 = 100\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him .4 hours to get to the store because 4 / 10 = .4\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him 24 minutes to get to the store because .4 x 60 = 24\nIn total it takes him 148 minutes to get to the store because 100 + 24 + 24 = 148\nOn average it takes him 49.3 minutes because 148 / 3 = 49.3\n#### 49.3', and your [Output] should be 'The solution is incorrect, the wrong type is unit_conversion_error, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 performs an incorrect unit conversion and mistakenly assumes that one hour has 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes, which only results in an error in one operand in the formula, thus it belongs to unit_conversion_error.' \nFor 'referencing_previous_step_value_error', the corresponding wrong [Solution] is ''The first four steps are the same as the correct [Solution].\nIn total it takes him 188 minutes to get to the store because 140 + 24 + 24 = 188\nOn average it takes him 62.6 minutes because 188 / 3 = 62.6\n#### 62.6', and your [Output] should be 'The solution is incorrect, the wrong type is referencing_previous_step_value_error, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 5. Step 5 erroneously references the result 140 of step 2 instead of 120, which only results in an error in one operand in the formula, therefore it belongs to referencing_previous_step_value_error.' \nFor 'referencing_context_value_error', the corresponding wrong [Solution] is 'The first two steps are the same as the correct [Solution].\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him .2 hours to get to the store because 4 / 20 = .2\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him 12 minutes to get to the store because .2 x 60 = 12\nIn total it takes him 144 minutes to get to the store because 120 + 12 + 12 = 144\nOn average it takes him 48 minutes because 144 / 3 = 48\n#### 48', and your [Output] should be 'The solution is incorrect, the wrong type is referencing_context_value_error, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 3. Step 3 mistakenly references the number 20 instead of 10 from the question, only resulting in an operand error in the formula, so it belongs to referencing_context_value_error.' \nFor 'counting_error', the corresponding wrong [Solution] is ''The first five steps are the same as the correct [Solution].\nOn average it takes him 84 minutes because 168 / 2 = 84\n#### 84', and your [Output] should be 'The solution is incorrect, the wrong type is counting_error, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 6. Step 6 counts Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday wrongly as 2 days instead of 3 days, only resulting in an operand error in the formula, so it belongs to counting_error.'\nFor 'calculation_error', the corresponding wrong [Solution] is 'The first five steps are the same as the correct [Solution].\nOn average it takes him 55 minutes because 168 / 3 = 55\n#### 55', and your [Output] should be 'The solution is incorrect, the wrong type is calculation_error, and the explanation is that the first wrong step is step 6. The operands and operators of the formula in step 6 are completely correct, but only the result is incorrectly calculated as 55 instead of 56, so it belongs to calculation_error.' \nPlease provide an appropriate [Output] for the following case.\n[Question]{question}\n\n[Solution]{solution}.\n\n### Response:"
