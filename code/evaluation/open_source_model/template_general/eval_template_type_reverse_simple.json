    "Below is an instruction that describes a task.\n\nWrite a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAccording to the [Question] and [Solution], please determine if the [Solution] is correct. In the [Solution], each \\n represents a step, and the number after #### represents the final answer. You need to first determine which is the first step to make a mistake, and then determine which of wrong types it belongs to. The wrong types that can be selected are 'adding_irrelevant_information', 'confusing_formula_error', 'missing_step', 'operator_error', 'unit_conversion_error', 'referencing_previous_step_value_error', 'referencing_context_value_error', 'counting_error', and 'calculation_error'. 'adding_irrelevant_information' represents that the first wrong step adds some information that is not included in the [Question] statement, which affects the final result.\n'confusing_formula_error' represents the incorrect use of formula, such as confusing the rectangular perimeter formula with the rectangular area formula, the square area formula with the square perimeter formula, and the cuboid volume formula with the cuboid surface area formula, which may cause errors in the operands and operators of the formula in the first wrong step.\n'missing_step' represents the absence of a necessary reasoning step, and if this absent step is added, the entire reasoning will become correct.\n'operator_error' represents only an error in the operator of the formula in the first wrong step.\n'unit_conversion_error' represents the incorrect use of unit conversion, for example, there are 12 inches in a foot, 1000 grams in a kilogram, 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, which may cause an error in the operand of the formula in the first wrong step.\n'referencing_previous_step_value_error' represents only an error in the operand of the formula in the first wrong step when referencing the result of its previous step. \n'referencing_context_value_error' represents only an error in the operand of the formula in the first wrong step when referencing the number in the [Question].\n'counting_error' represents only an error in the counting process, such as counting Saturday and Sunday as 3 days instead of 2 days, which may cause an error in the operand of the formula in the first wrong step.\n'calculation_error' represents that the operands and operators of the formula in the first wrong step are exactly correct, and only the result is calculated incorrectly.\nIf the [Solution] is correct, format your response as: The solution is correct, and the explanation is #, which is your explanation about why the [Solution] is correct. If the [Solution] is incorrect, format your response as: The solution is incorrect, the wrong type is #, which must be chosen from above nine wrong types, and the explanation is #, which is your explanation about why the [Solution] is incorrect.\n\n[Question]{question}\n\n[Solution]{solution}.\n\n### Response:"
