    {"is_correct":"no","pred_wrong_type":"calculation_error","type_explanation":"The first wrong step is step 6. The operands and operators of the formula in step 6 are completely correct, but only the result is incorrectly calculated as 55 instead of 56, so it belongs to calculation_error."},
    {"is_correct":"no","pred_wrong_type":"counting_error","type_explanation":"The first wrong step is step 6. Step 6 counts Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday wrongly as 2 days instead of 3 days, only resulting in an operand error in the formula, so it belongs to counting_error."},
    {"is_correct":"no","pred_wrong_type":"referencing_context_value_error","type_explanation":"The first wrong step is step 3. Step 3 mistakenly references the number 20 instead of 10 from the question, only resulting in an operand error in the formula, so it belongs to referencing_context_value_error. Steps 4, 5, and 6, as its subsequent related steps, reference the wrong result of step 3, resulting in the incorrect final answer."},
    {"is_correct":"no","pred_wrong_type":"referencing_previous_step_value_error","type_explanation":"The first wrong step is step 5. Step 5 erroneously references the result 140 of step 2 instead of 120, which only results in an error in one operand in the formula, therefore it belongs to referencing_previous_step_value_error. Its subsequent step 6 references the result of step 5, resulting in the incorrect final answer."},
    {"is_correct":"no","pred_wrong_type":"unit_conversion_error","type_explanation":"The first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 performs an incorrect unit conversion and mistakenly assumes that one hour has 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes, which only results in an error in one operand in the formula, thus it belongs to unit_conversion_error. Step 5 and 6, as its subsequent steps, reference the erroneous result of step 2, resulting in the incorrect final answers."},
    {"is_correct":"no","pred_wrong_type":"operator_error","type_explanation":"The first wrong step is step 6. Step 6 mistakenly uses addition instead of division, and only one operator in the formula is incorrect, so it belongs to operator_error."},
    {"is_correct":"no","pred_wrong_type":"missing_step","type_explanation":"The first wrong step is step 4. Step 4 does not convert the time he went to the store on Sunday from hours to minutes, but directly adds up the time on Sunday (hours) and the time on Tuesday and Thursday (minutes). So there is a missing step here to convert Sunday's time from hours to minutes, and this error belongs to missing_step. Step 5, as the subsequent step of step 4, references the wrong result of step 4, resulting in the incorrect final answer."},
    {"is_correct":"no","pred_wrong_type":"confusing_formula_error","type_explanation":"The first wrong step is step 2. Step 2 confuses the perimeter and area formulas of rectangle and it should calculate the area of the rectangle which is equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the length plus length plus width plus width, equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle. That means, it should calculate 3 ft. * 7 ft. = 21 sq. ft. instead of 3 ft. + 7 ft. + 3 ft. + 7 ft.= 20 sq. ft. Because it confuses the area and perimeter formulas of rectangle, resulting in errors in both the operands and operators of the formula, it belongs to confusing_formula_error. Step 5 and 7, as the subsequent steps of step 2, reference the wrong result of step 2, resulting in the incorrect final answer."},
    {"is_correct":"no","pred_wrong_type":"adding_irrelevant_information","type_explanation":"The first wrong step is step 5. Step 5 adds information not included in the question statement <Because there is also a door of 20 square feet on the second wall>, causing the result of step 5 to be overestimated by 20, so it belongs to adding_irrelevant_information. Step 7, as the subsequent step of step 5, references the wrong result of step 5, resulting in the incorrect final answer."}
