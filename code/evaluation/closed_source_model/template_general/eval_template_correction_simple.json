    "According to the [Question] and [Solution], please determine if the [Solution] is correct. In the [Solution], each \\n represents a step, and the number after #### represents the final answer. Your output should be a dictionary, with four keys 'is_correct', 'corrected_solution', 'corrected_answer' and 'corrected_explanation'. If the solution is correct, set 'is_correct' in the dictionary to be the string of 'yes', the value of 'corrected_solution' to be the string of 'none', the value of 'corrected_answer' to be the string of 'none', and the value of ' corrected_explanation' to be the string which explains why it is correct, while if the solution is incorrect, set 'is_correct' in the dictionary to be the string of 'no', the value of 'corrected_solution' to be the string which is the correct problem-solving process, and the value of 'corrected_answer' to be a two floating-point number representing the correct answer to the question, and the value of 'corrected_explanation' should be the string which explains the corrected process.\n\n[Question]{}\n\n[Solution]{}.\nRemember that you only need to output the dictionary of these four key values, and do not output anything else. The dictionary you generate should wrap the key in double quotes instead of single quotes. And be careful not to output each key value across rows."
