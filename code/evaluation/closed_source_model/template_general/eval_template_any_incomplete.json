    "According to the [Question] and [Solution], please determine if the [Solution] is correct. Please note that the [Solution] is incomplete, you only need to determine whether the existing steps are correct or not. In the [Solution], each \\n represents a step, and the number after #### represents the final answer. Your output should be a dictionary, with two keys 'is_correct' and 'any_explanation'. If the solution is correct, set 'is_correct' in the dictionary to be the string of 'yes', and the value of 'any_explanation' to be the string which explains why it is correct, while if the solution is incorrect, set 'is_correct' in the dictionary to be the string of 'no', and the value of 'any_explanation' should be the string which explains why it is incorrect. \nPlease provide an appropriate [Output] for the following case.\n[Question]{}\n\n[Solution]{}.\nRemember that you only need to output the dictionary of these two key values, and do not output anything else. The dictionary you generate should wrap the key in double quotes instead of single quotes."
