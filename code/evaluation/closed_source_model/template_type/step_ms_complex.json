There is a necessary step missing here to convert Sunday's time from hours to minutes, which is 2 * 60=120. Step 4 should calculate 120+24+24=168 instead of 2+24+24=50. This also affects the subsequent step 5, where 50/3=16.6 is calculated instead of 168/3=56. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 4, so pred_wrong_step is 4."},
    {"is_correct":"no","pred_wrong_step":1,"step_explanation":"The first erroneous step is step 1, which directly converts Sunday's journey from hour to minute as time. There is a necessary step missing here to divide the distance on Sunday by its speed to obtain its time, which is 4/2=2. After obtaining the time, perform a conversion from hour to minute with 2 * 60=120 instead of directly calculating 4 * 60=240. Step 4 should calculate 120+24+24=168 instead of 240+24+24=288. This also affects the subsequent step 5, where an incorrect calculation of 288/3=96 instead of 168/3=56, resulting in the final erroneous result. The first step to make a mistake, which is the root cause of the mistake, is step 1, so pred_wrong_step is 1."}
