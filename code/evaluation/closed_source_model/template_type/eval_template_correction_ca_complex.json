    "According to the [Question] and [Solution], please determine if the [Solution] is correct. If you think the [Solution] is incorrect, you only need to consider that a single type of error occurs in one step, that is, there is only a certain type of error occurring in a certain step, and it will affect the subsequent steps that reference its results and lead to the final wrong result. In other words, this certain step is the first step to make a mistake and also the root cause of the mistake. You only need to determine which is the first step to make a mistake.\nIt should be noted that the certain error type that appears in the [Solution] is calculation error, which represents that the operands and operators of the formula in the first wrong step are exactly correct, and only the result is calculated incorrectly.\n In the [Solution], each \\n represents a step, and the number after #### represents the final answer.\n Your output should be a dictionary, with four keys 'is_correct', 'corrected_solution', 'corrected_answer' and 'corrected_explanation'. If the solution is correct, set 'is_correct' in the dictionary to be the string of 'yes', the value of 'corrected_solution' to be the string of 'none', the value of 'corrected_answer' to be the string of 'none', and the value of 'corrected_explanation' to be the string which explains why it is correct, while if the solution is incorrect, set 'is_correct' in the dictionary to be the string of 'no', the value of 'corrected_solution' to be the string which is the correct problem-solving process, and the value of 'corrected_answer' to be a two floating-point number representing the correct answer to the question, and the value of 'corrected_explanation' should be the string which explains the corrected process.\nNext, I will provide you with an example to help you understand how to correct.\nHere is a [Question] and its correct [Solution].\n[Question] is 'On the weekend, Tony will walk to the store. On weekdays, he runs to the store. When he walks, he goes 2 MPH. When he runs, he goes 10 MPH. The store is 4 miles away. If he goes on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, what is the average time in minutes that he spends to get to the store?'\nThe correct [Solution] is 'On Sunday he takes 2 hours to get there because 4 / 2 = 2\nThis takes him 120 minutes because 2 x 60 = 120\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him .4 hours to get to the store because 4 / 10 = .4\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him 24 minutes to get to the store because .4 x 60 = 24\nIn total it takes him 168 minutes to get to the store because 120 + 24 + 24 = 168\nOn average it takes him 56 minutes because 168 / 3 = 56\n#### 56'\nThe following is two incorrect [Solution]s and their corresponding [Output]s.\nThe first incorrect [Solution] is 'On Sunday he takes 2 hours to get there because 4 / 2 = 2\nThis takes him 120 minutes because 2 x 60 = 120\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him .4 hours to get to the store because 4 / 10 = .4\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him 24 minutes to get to the store because .4 x 60 = 24\nIn total it takes him 138 minutes to get to the store because 120 + 24 + 24 = 138\nOn average it takes him 46 minutes because 138 / 3 = 46\n#### 46'.\nAnd your [Output] should be {}\nThe second incorrect [Solution] is 'On Sunday he takes 2 hours to get there because 4 / 2 = 2\nThis takes him 120 minutes because 2 x 60 = 120\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him .4 hours to get to the store because 4 / 10 = .4\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, it takes him 24 minutes to get to the store because .4 x 60 = 24\nIn total it takes him 168 minutes to get to the store because 120 + 24 + 24 = 168\nOn average it takes him 50 minutes because 168 / 3 = 50\n#### 50'.\nAnd your [Output] should be {}\nPlease provide an appropriate [Output] for the following case.\n\n[Question]{}\n\n[Solution]{}.\nRemember that you only need to output the dictionary of these four key values, and do not output anything else. The dictionary you generate should wrap the key in double quotes instead of single quotes. And be careful not to output each key value across rows."
