Step 2 confuses the perimeter and area formulas of rectangle and it should calculate the area of the rectangle which is equal to the length multiplied by width, rather than the length plus length plus width plus width, equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle. That means, it should calculate 3 ft. * 7 ft. = 21 sq. ft. instead of 3 ft. + 7 ft. + 3 ft. + 7 ft.= 20 sq. ft. Step 5 and 7, as the subsequent steps of step 2, reference the wrong result of step 2, resulting in the incorrect final answer. Step 5 miscalculates 20 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 79 sq. ft. instead of 21 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 80 sq. ft. And step 7 miscalculates 640 sq. ft. - 79 sq. ft. = 561 sq. ft. instead of 640 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 560 sq. ft.
