    "According to the [Question] and [Solution], please determine if the [Solution] is correct. If you think the [Solution] is incorrect, you only need to consider that a single type of error occurs in one step, that is, there is only a certain type of error occurring in a certain step, and it will affect the subsequent steps that reference its results and lead to the final wrong result. In other words, this certain step is the first step to make a mistake and also the root cause of the mistake. You only need to determine which is the first step to make a mistake.\nIt should be noted that the certain error type that appears in the [Solution] is adding irrelevant information, which represents that the first wrong step adds some information that is not included in the [Question] statement and affects the final result.\n In the [Solution], each \\n represents a step, and the number after #### represents the final answer.\n Your output should be a dictionary, with four keys 'is_correct', 'corrected_solution', 'corrected_answer' and 'corrected_explanation'. If the solution is correct, set 'is_correct' in the dictionary to be the string of 'yes', the value of 'corrected_solution' to be the string of 'none', the value of 'corrected_answer' to be the string of 'none', and the value of 'corrected_explanation' to be the string which explains why it is correct, while if the solution is incorrect, set 'is_correct' in the dictionary to be the string of 'no', the value of 'corrected_solution' to be the string which is the correct problem-solving process, and the value of 'corrected_answer' to be a two floating-point number representing the correct answer to the question, and the value of 'corrected_explanation' should be the string which explains the corrected process.\nNext, I will provide you with an example to help you understand how to correct.\nHere is a [Question] and its correct [Solution].\n[Question] is 'Linda is painting her bedroom. Her bedroom has 4 walls, with the room being 20 feet wide by 20 feet long by 8 feet tall. One wall has a 3-foot by 7-foot doorway. A second wall has a 6-foot by 4-foot window. A third wall has a 5-foot by 7-foot doorway to a walk-in-closet. And the fourth wall is completely solid. What is the total area of wall space that Linda will have to paint?'\nThe correct [Solution] is 'The solid wall is 8 ft. * 20 ft. = 160 sq. ft.\nThe doorway is 3 ft. * 7 ft. = 21 sq. ft.\nThe window is 6 ft. * 4 ft. = 24 sq. ft.\nThe closet door is 5 ft. * 7 ft. = 35 sq. ft.\nThe total area of the doors and windows is 21 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 80 sq. ft.\nThe solid wall is 160 sq. ft., so before the areas of the doors and window are taken into account, the total wall area is 4 * 160 sq. ft. = 640 sq. ft.\nTaking into account the doors and window, the total wall area Linda will have to paint is 640 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 560 sq. ft.\n#### 560'\nThe following is two incorrect [Solution]s and their corresponding [Output]s.\nThe first incorrect [Solution] is 'The solid wall is 8 ft. * 20 ft. = 160 sq. ft.\nThe doorway is 3 ft. * 7 ft. = 21 sq. ft.\nThe window is 6 ft. * 4 ft. = 24 sq. ft.\nThe closet door is 5 ft. * 7 ft. = 35 sq. ft.\nBecause there is also a doorway of 20 sq. ft. on the second wall, the total area of the doors and windows is 21 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. +20 sq. ft. = 100 sq. ft.\nThe solid wall is 160 sq. ft., so before the areas of the doors and window are taken into account, the total wall area is 4 * 160 sq. ft. = 640 sq. ft.\nTaking into account the doors and window, the total wall area Linda will have to paint is 640 sq. ft. - 100 sq. ft. = 540 sq. ft.\n#### 540'.\nAnd your [Output] should be {}\nThe second incorrect [Solution] is 'The solid wall is 8 ft. * 20 ft. = 160 sq. ft.\nThe doorway is 3 ft. * 7 ft. = 21 sq. ft.\nThe window is 6 ft. * 4 ft. = 24 sq. ft.\nThe closet door is 5 ft. * 7 ft. = 35 sq. ft.\nBecause there is also a window of 30 sq. ft. on the second wall, the total area of the doors and windows is 21 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. +30 sq. ft. = 110 sq. ft.\nThe solid wall is 160 sq. ft., so before the areas of the doors and window are taken into account, the total wall area is 4 * 160 sq. ft. = 640 sq. ft.\nTaking into account the doors and window, the total wall area Linda will have to paint is 640 sq. ft. - 110 sq. ft. = 530 sq. ft.\n#### 530'.\nAnd your [Output] should be {}\nPlease provide an appropriate [Output] for the following case.\n\n[Question]{}\n\n[Solution]{}.\nRemember that you only need to output the dictionary of these four key values, and do not output anything else. The dictionary you generate should wrap the key in double quotes instead of single quotes. And be careful not to output each key value across rows."
